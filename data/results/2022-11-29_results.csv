"Spontaneous past and future thinking about the COVID-19 pandemic across 14 countries: Effects of individual and country-level COVID-19 impact indicators","In 2020, the world was amid a global health crisis-the COVID-19 pandemic. Nations had varying levels of morbidity and mortality and adopted different measures to prevent the spread of infection. Effects of the pandemic on spontaneous (rather than voluntary) past and future thoughts remain unexplored. Here, we report data from a multicountry online study examining how both country- and individual-level factors are associated with this core aspect of human cognition. Results showed that national (stringency of measures) and individual (attention to COVID-related information and worry) factors separately and jointly predicted the frequency of people's pandemic-related spontaneous thoughts. Additionally, no typical positivity biases were found, as both past and future spontaneous thoughts had a negative emotional valence. This large-scale multinational study provides novel insights toward better understanding the emergence and qualities of spontaneous past and future thoughts. Findings are discussed in terms of the determinants and functions of spontaneous thought. General Audience Summary The COVID-19 pandemic was a global phenomenon;people in countries across the world experienced the pandemic similarly, but did it affect the way we perceived the past and future? This study reports whether and how people experienced spontaneous thoughts about the past and future of the pandemic-that is, images of the past or future that appear in mind without warning and with little effort (e.g., remembering a recent lockdown or imagining a future announcement)-during the pandemic's first wave. Spontaneous past and future thoughts are important in daily life and can indicate poor mental health when negative in nature. Here, for the first time, we asked people from 14 different countries across four continents to report the frequency and emotional characteristics of their spontaneous past and future pandemic-related thoughts in the first wave of the pandemic. The study showed that the national context (in particular, COVID regulations) predicted the frequency of people's spontaneous thoughts about the pandemic. Emotional aspects of these thoughts were predicted by individual factors such as isolation, worry, attention to COVID-related information, and impact of COVID-19 on everyday life, in addition to national factors. Finally, in contrast to previous research showing a ""positive bias,"" which is thought to be beneficial, past and future spontaneous pandemic-related thoughts had a negative emotional tone. This study allowed us to demonstrate that the tendency to experience spontaneous thoughts about an ongoing international event can be predicted by societal context, which may be valuable for examining the social predictors of spontaneous emotional thoughts about the past and future. The study also characterized the negative tone of past and future spontaneous thoughts about the pandemic, and future studies will be needed to examine the longer term consequences of these effects.","Cole, Scott N.; Markostamou, Ioanna, Watson, Lynn Ann, Barzykowski, Krystian, Ergen, &Iacute;rem, Taylor, Andrea, Ã–ner, Sezin","https://doi.org/10.1037/mac0000071","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41832,""
"Sea swimming and snorkeling in tropical coastal blue spaces and mental well-being: Findings from Indonesian island communities during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has considerable mental health impacts. Immersive nature-based interventions, such as swimming or snorkeling, may help mitigate the global mental health crisis caused by the pandemic. To investigate this, we collected cross-sectional data from residents of coastal villages (nÂ =Â 308) in Kepulauan Selayar, Indonesia. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used with mental well-being as the outcome variable, operationalized as the Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores from the SF-12 (12-item Short Form Health Survey). After adjusting for covariates, the activity of sea swimming or snorkeling was found to be significantly associated with better mental well-being (<U+03B7>2Â =Â 0.036;pÂ &lt;Â 0.01). Predictive margins analysis revealed that those who engaged in sea swimming or snorkeling for one to three days a week gained a 2.7 increase in their MCS scores, compared to those who did not. A non-linear dose-response relationship was detected: for those swimming or snorkeling more than three days per week, there was only an increase of 1.7 MCS score compared to the 0-day. Overall this study contributes to the expanding of evidence base, showing that interactions with blue spaces can be beneficial for mental health, especially in a potentially stressful time such as the current pandemic.","Maharja, Carya, Praptiwi, Radisti A.; Roberts, Bethany R.; Morrissey, Karyn, White, Mathew P.; Sari, Nuzulia M.; Cholifatullah, Fauzan, Sugardjito, Jito, Fleming, Lora E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2022.100584","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism;JOUR: 100584,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41833,""
"Digital mental health interventions for obsessive compulsive and related disorders: A brief review of evidence-based interventions and future directions","Individuals with obsessive compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs), including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, and hoarding disorder, suffer from distressing or impairing obsessive preoccupation and/or time-consuming compulsive behaviors. OCRDs are often severe, chronic, and associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity and functional impairment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be efficacious for all the OCRDs. However, most individuals with an OCRD do not receive CBT, and of those who do, not all respond or respond fully to treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the chasm between those who need mental health care and access to clinical services. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have emerged over the past two decades as a solution to the access to care gap, and acceptance of digital solutions was catalyzed by the pandemic. DMHIs have the potential to address unmet mental health needs by offering scalable, low-stigma, cost-effective solutions. This paper reviews current evidence-based DMHIs for OCRDs and describes areas for future research.","Hiranandani, Sarah, Ipek, Simay I.; Wilhelm, Sabine, Greenberg, Jennifer L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2022.100765","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders;JOUR: 100765,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41834,""
"Expanding The Accessibility of Harm Reduction Services in The United States: Measuring the Impact of An Automated Harm Reduction Dispensing Machine","Background In 2021, approximately 107,622 Americans died from drug overdose in the United States. With overdose deaths rising rapidly, it is imperative that prevention efforts focus on expanding proven, evidence-based strategies to curb overdose death rates such as targeted naloxone distribution and syringe service programs (SSPs). The COVID-19 pandemic placed additional strain on SSPs, increasing the need for programs that minimize direct contact and potential COVID-19 exposure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an automated harm reduction dispensing machine on the local accessibility of harm reduction services. Objectives The primary outcome of the study is the number of harm reduction supplies distributed to the community by the dispensing machine in its first year compared to the number of supplies distributed by the same organization in the previous year. Secondary outcomes include the countywide incidence of fatal drug overdose and HIV compared to previous years. Methods The machine is located outside, in the same location as a once weekly, in-person SSP. Clients register with the program over the phone with a harm reduction coordinator. Each client is connected to products and services such as naloxone, sharps containers, safer injection/smoking kits, pregnancy tests, HIV tests, substance use disorder treatment and more. Results Since installation, 637 individuals registered with the program, 12% of whom had never reportedly used harm reduction services before. Within its first year of use, the machine dispensed 3,360 naloxone doses and 10,155 fentanyl test strips, more than any other SSP in the county. Conclusion The implementation of an automated harm reduction dispensing machine led to an increased accessibility of harm reduction products and services and was associated with a lower countywide incidence of unintentional overdose death and HIV. The association with decreased overdose death and HIV incidence should be further investigated to assess causality.","Arendt, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2022.10.027","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the American Pharmacists Association;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41835,""
"Stress and coping strategies in the general population of Greece and Cyprus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown policy had a profound psychological impact on the general population worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the level of stress and coping strategies used during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak and their association. Secondary aims were to a) identify the most important coping strategies and b) investigate predictors of stress. A cross-sectional study was conducted by using an anonymous online questionnaire. The study was carried out from April 23 to May 4 2020. A snowball sampling method was conducted to recruit potential participants from the general population of Greece and Cyprus. Participants over 18 years old who were familiar with the Greek language were included. The psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Coping strategies were assessed using 15 statements detected from a review of the literature. Participants were asked to rate each one of the coping strategies according to how important it was to them, on a four-point likert scale. The sample consisted of 3941 participants (74.2% women, N=2926), with a mean age of 36.9 years old. The most important coping strategies adopted were 1) â€œDealing the situation with a positive attitudeâ€ (96.5%), 2) â€œFollow strict personal protective measuresâ€ (95,9%), 3) â€œAcquiring knowledge about coronavirusâ€ (94.6%), 4) â€œEngaging in health-promoting behaviorsâ€ (89.6%), 5) â€œLimiting the time spent on mediaâ€ (75.5%). The highest and positive coefficients were recorded for the association of IES-R scales with 1) â€œTalking with family and friends to reduce stressâ€, 2) â€œSeeking help from a mental health professionalâ€, 3) â€œLimiting the time spent on mediaâ€, 4) â€œRelieving and managing emotionsâ€, 5) â€œPracticing relaxation techniquesâ€. 26.5% showed severe psychological impact. Conclusion: Addressing stress levels with the use of functional coping strategies can be beneficial to protect the general population from adverse psychological outcomes.","Kleanthous, E.; Evangelou, E.; Georgiadou, A.; Galanis, P.; Andreadaki, E.; Tzavara, C.; Kaitelidou, D.; Kallergis, G.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2022.100306","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Trauma & Dissociation;JOUR: 100306,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41836,""

"Telepsychiatry Use Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Children Enrolled in Medicaid","This study examined telepsychiatry use among children enrolled in Medicaid before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective analysis was conducted of claims data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System for children (ages 3-17) with any mental health service use in 2019 (N=5,606,555) and 2020 (N=5,094,446). The number of children using mental health services declined by 9.1% from 2019 to 2020. Mental health services in all care settings (inpatient, outpatient, residential, emergency department, intensive outpatient/partial hospitalization) declined except for telehealth, which increased by 829.6%. In 2020, 44.5% of children using telehealth were non-Hispanic White, 16.1% were non-Hispanic Black, and 19.7% were Hispanic. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, trauma, anxiety, depression, and behavior/conduct disorder were the most prevalent psychiatric diagnoses among children using telehealth services. Although telehealth use increased substantially in 2020, overall mental health service use declined among Medicaid-enrolled children. Telehealth may not fully address unmet mental health service needs.","Ali, West, Bagalman, Sherry","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.20220378","20221129","Adolescents/adolescence; COVID-19; Child psychiatry/general; Children; Mental Health; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41839,""
"Inequalities in Access to Mental Health Treatment by Australian Youths During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The authors aimed to evaluate changes in use of government-subsidized primary mental health services, through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), by young people during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and whether changes were associated with age, sex, socioeconomic status, and residence in particular geographical areas. Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted by using quarterly mental health MBS service data (all young people ages 12-25 years, 2015-2020) for individual Statistical Area Level 3 areas across Australia. The data captured &gt;22.4 million service records. Meta-analysis and meta-regression models estimated the pandemic interruption effect at the national level and delineated factors influencing these estimates. Compared with expected prepandemic trends, a 6.2% (95% CI=5.3%-7.2%) increase was noted for all young people in use of MBS mental health services in 2020. Substantial differences were found between age and sex subgroups, with a higher increase among females and young people ages 18-25. A decreasing trend was observed for males ages 18-25 (3.5% reduction, 95% CI=2.5%-4.5%). The interruption effect was strongly associated with socioeconomic status. Service uptake increased in areas of high socioeconomic status, with smaller or limited uptake in areas of low socioeconomic status. During 2020, young people's use of primary mental health services increased overall. However, increases were inequitably distributed and relatively low, compared with increases in population-level mental health burden. Policy makers should address barriers to primary care access for young people, particularly for young males and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.","Gao, McDonald, Hamilton, Simons, Menssink, Filia, Rickwood, Rice, Hickie, McGorry, Cotton","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.20220345","20221129","COVID-19; Community mental health services; Help-seeking; Mental health; Primary care; Self-help","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41840,""
"Satisfaction with web-based courses on clinical practice guidelines for psychiatrists: Findings from the ""Effectiveness of Guidelines for Dissemination and Education in Psychiatric Treatment (EGUIDE)"" project","To disseminate, educate, and validate psychiatric clinical practice guidelines, the Effectiveness of Guidelines for Dissemination and Education in Psychiatric Treatment (EGUIDE) project was launched in 2016. In this study, we investigated whether the web-based courses offered by this project would be as effective as the face-to-face courses. We analyzed and compared survey answers about overall participant satisfaction with the course and answers regarding clinical knowledge of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder between 170 participants who took the web-based courses in 2020 and 689 participants who took the face-to-face courses from 2016 to 2019. The web-based course participants completed the survey questions about satisfaction with the web-based courses. The web-based courses were conducted using a combination of web services to make it as similar as possible to the face-to-face courses. The degree of satisfaction assessed by the general evaluation of the web-based courses was higher than what was expected from the face-to-face courses. The degree of satisfaction was similar for the courses on schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In addition, there were no significant differences in overall satisfaction and clinical knowledge between web-based and face-to-face courses. In conclusion, the web-based courses on clinical practice guidelines provided by the EGUIDE project were rated as more satisfying than the face-to-face course that the participants expected to take and no differences in the effectiveness of either course. The results suggest that, after the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be possible to disseminate this educational material more widely by adopting web-based courses additionally face-to-face courses.","Iida, Okada, Nemoto, Hasegawa, Numata, Ogasawara, Miura, Matsumoto, Hori, Iga, Ichihashi, Hashimoto, Yamada, Ohi, Yasui-Furukori, Fukumoto, Tsuboi, Usami, Furihata, Takaesu, Hishimoto, Muraoka, Katsumoto, Nagasawa, Ochi, Komatsu, Kikuchi, Takeshima, Onitsuka, Tamai, Kubota, Inada, Watanabe, Kawasaki, Hashimoto","https://doi.org/10.1002/npr2.12300","20221129","EGUIDE; clinical practice guideline; evidence-practice gap; face-to-face; web-based","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41841,""
"COVID-19-Related Functional Impairment in a Community Sample of Korean Adults: Associations With Depression, COVID-19 Infection Fear, and Resilience","We aimed to determine the effects of depression, COVID-19 infection fear, and resilience on COVID-19-related functional impairment. We obtained data from 476 community-dwelling adults aged 20-69 years living in Jeju, South Korea, and evaluated the relationships between COVID-19-related functional impairment (work/school, social, and home life) and sociodemographic and healthrelated characteristics, COVID-19-related life changes (financial difficulties since the pandemic, employment change, interpersonal conflict), and clinical characteristics, including depression, COVID-19 infection fear, and resilience. Functional impairment in the home life domain was associated with marital status and monthly income. Greater work/school, social, and home life functional impairment was significantly associated with all COVID-19-related life changes. Regression analysis indicated that resilience modulated the positive associations of COVID-19-related functional impairment with symptoms of depression and COVID-19 infection fear when relevant factors were controlled for. Our results suggest the importance of clinical characteristics, including depression, COVID-19 infection fear, and resilience for understanding functional impairment related to COVID-19.

"Effectiveness of a community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) service model to enhance family-based long-term care for Thai older adults in Chiang Mai, Thailand: a cluster-randomized controlled trial TCTR20190412004","Populations around the world are ageing faster, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries where health and social care are yet to be universal and inclusive for the ageing population. This community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) model is a novel prevention-based, long-term care model enhancing the family-based care system traditionally practised in Thailand and neighbouring Asian countries, and many low-and middle-income countries globally. This study assessed the effectiveness of the CIIC model in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The two-arm parallel intervention study was designed as a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The study population at randomization and analysis was 2788 participants: 1509 in six intervention clusters and 1279 in six control clusters. The research protocol was approved by the WHO Research Ethics Review Committee (WHO/ERC ID; ERC.0003064). The CIIC service intervention model is a combination of formal care and informal care in a subdistrict setting consisting of three components: (1) care prevention delivered as community group exercise and home exercise; (2) care capacity-building of the family caregiver; and (3) community respite service. The primary outcome was family caregivers' burden at 6-month follow-up, and secondary outcome was activities of daily living. Analysis applied the intention-to-treat approach using cluster-level analysis via STATA 16 SE. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the two arms. Loss of follow up was 3.7%. Mean age of the participants was 69.53&#xa0;years. Women constituted 60%. The COVID-19 pandemic caused delayed implementation. The proportion of families with reduced caregiver burden at 6-month follow-up was higher among the intervention clusters (mean 39.4%) than control clusters (mean 28.62%). The intervention clusters experienced less functional decline and fewer people with depression. When communities are integrated for preventing care, and families are empowered for giving care, it is possible to secure universal access to health and social care for the older persons, with basic resources mobilized from communities. This study had shown the CIIC model as an effective and potential step to the realization of universal health and long-term care coverage being inclusive of ageing populations in Thailand and globally.

"Socio-demographic disparities in receipt of clinical health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic for Canadian children with disability","Little is known about the experience of receiving in-person and virtual clinical health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic for Canadian children with developmental disabilities and delays facing multiple layers of vulnerability (e.g., low income, low educational attainment families). We examined the relationship between socio-demographic factors and the receipt of these services (physical and mental health services) during COVID-19 for Canadian children with these conditions. Data collected in Canada for the Global Report on Developmental Delays, Disorders and Disabilities were used. The survey: (1) was developed and disseminated in collaboration with caregivers of children with disabilities, (2) included topics such as response to the pandemic and receipt of services and supports, and (3) documented the experiences of a non-random convenience sample of caregivers of children (any age) with these conditions during and prior to the pandemic. We used four logistic regression models to assess the association between socio-demographic factors and receipt of services. Being a single parent, having low educational attainment (high school or less), having low income (making less than $40,000 per year), working less than full time (working part-time, working reduced hours due to COVID, retired, stay home parent or student), as well as male gender and older age of the child with disability were factors associated with decreased likelihood of receiving services. Our findings point to the need for tailoring services for families of children with disabilities, particularly low socioeconomic status families, to ensure continuity of care during public health emergencies.","Gonzalez, Zeidan, Lai, Yusuf, Wright, Steiman, Karpur, Shih, Elsabbagh, Shikako","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08672-1","20221129","COVID-19; Canadian families; Disparities; Neurodevelopmental conditions; Receipt of health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41844,""
"COVID-19 related anxiety and its associated factors: a cross-sectional study on older adults in Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in serious mental health conditions, particularly among older adults. This research explored the prevalence of COVID-19-related anxiety and its associated factors among older adults residing in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,045 older Bangladeshi adults aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;60&#xa0;years through telephone interviews in September 2021. A semi-structured interview schedule was used to collect data on participants' characteristics and COVID-19-related anxiety. The anxiety level was measured using the Bengali version of the five-point Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). A linear regression model explored the factors associated with COVID-19-related&#xa0;anxiety. Overall, the prevalence of COVID-19-related anxiety was 23.2%. The regression analysis revealed that the average COVID-19-related&#xa0;anxiety score was significantly higher among females (&#x3b2;: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.81), and among those who faced difficulty getting medicine (&#x3b2;: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.97), felt isolated (&#x3b2;: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.95), and felt requiring additional care during the pandemic (&#x3b2;: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.91). Alternatively, the average COVID-19-related&#xa0;anxiety score was significantly lower among those who were widowed (&#x3b2;: -0.46, 95% CI: -0.87 to -0.04) and living distant from the health centre (&#x3b2;: -0.48, 95% CI: -0.79 to -0.17). The findings of the present study suggest providing immediate psychosocial support package to the older adults, particularly females and those who are vulnerable to receive health and social care support&#xa0;during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.","Mistry, Ali, Yadav, Das, Akter, Huda, Hadisuyatmana, Rahman, Lim, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04403-2","20221129","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Coronavirus anxiety; Older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41845,""

We categorized participant responses into two overarching thematic dimensions: (1) ways of coping and (2) coping challenges. Ways of coping included the following main themes: (1) taking care of oneself, (2) connecting socially, (3) engaging in pandemic-specific coping strategies, (4) keeping busy, (5) taking care of others, (6) creating a sense of normalcy, (7) changing perspectives, and (8) practicing spirituality. Coping challenges included the following: (1) the perception of coping poorly, (2) loss of coping methods, (3) managing frontline or essential work, and (4) worries about the future.

"Either 'a blessing in disguise', or 'I couldn't get help,': Australian and Aotearoa NZ women's experiences of early infant feeding during COVID-19","To manage the COVID-19 pandemic, public health restrictions and a rapid pivot to telehealth occurred. Peripartum services were significantly affected by a strained infrastructure. Decreased face to face access to health services and support affected maternal experiences and confidence internationally, yet little was reported with the Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand context. To explore the early parenting and infant feeding experiences of new mothers from Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand in the context of a pandemic. An interpretive qualitative approach and thematic analysis obtained an in-depth understanding of the experiences of 27 mothers who gave birth during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand women reported similar experiences, which varied contextually. Restrictions and requirements impacted favourably and unfavourably. Many women found the peace and space of social distancing an unexpected benefit and were proud of their achievements, whilst others shared feelings of isolation and distress. Some women felt they instinctively did what they needed to do. Experiences correlated with differing levels of self-efficacy. While many women relished the freedom from social obligations when faced with feeding challenges, there was general dissatisfaction with the level of support available. Care was fragmented, and health care needs were unmet, impacting feeding and parenting decisions and mental health. Access to timely and appropriate professional support is an important factor in establishing breastfeeding and developing parenting confidence, particularly in the context of a pandemic and should be a health policy priority.","Atchan, Graham, Hartney, Martis, Kearney, Davey, Daellenbach, Hall, Sweet","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2022.11.003","20221128","Australia; Breastfeeding; COVID-19; Infant feeding; New Zealand; Parenting; Self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41847,""
"Mental health between present issues and future expectations","Based on a 2020 survey of more than 4000 working-age women, we investigate the main determinants of mental distress during the COVID-19 first wave in Italy. We address the role of two groups of drivers: present issues (e.g., present working status) and expectations about the future (e.g., fear of losing the job). Our results show that expectations do play a crucial role on mental distress. Younger women and those lacking a high school degree are in most distress. even controlling for individual fixed effects, and contextual factors which account for potential dynamics in the labor market. We investigate how expectations interact with several individual dimension, as age, level of education, sector of employment, and individual gender norms. Expectations of future employment is still among the main driver, but respondents with higher stereotype show higher distress due to uncertainty about the future employment of the partner, suggesting that the prevalence of a traditional breadwinner model is a source of additional distress on this population.","Barili, Grembi, Rosso","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2022.11.010","20221128","COVID-19; Expectations; Gender stereotypes; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41848,""
"Designing a virtual mental health consultation program to support and strengthen childcare centers impacted by COVID-19: A randomized controlled trial protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative psychosocial impacts on young children; teachers in childcare centers continue to be overwhelmed by how to address the downstream psychological effects children are experiencing. This randomized controlled trial will study the role of a community-based, childcare center-support system in improving resilience and mitigating the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on children's development. This study will be modeled on a successful Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation (ECMHC) intervention which utilizes mental health consultants to deliver a Jump Start+: COVID 19 Support (JS&#x202f;+&#x202f;CS) virtual toolkit to childcare centers in Miami-Dade County via a Kubi robot. The toolkit comprises four strength-based strategies likely to be effective in improving resiliency following disasters: Safety Planning, Effective Communication, Adult Self-Care, and Trauma-Informed Behavior Support. Our first aim will utilize a cluster randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of JS&#x202f;+&#x202f;CS on improving the psychosocial functioning of young children, as compared to an obesity prevention intervention control group.

"Utilization of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics in Scandinavian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","To study patterns of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and hypnotic drug utilization in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The monthly observed number of prescription fills of antidepressants, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related hypnotics (BZ), and other anxiolytics and hypnotics (OAH) per population in 2020 were compared with predicted numbers based on analysis of covariance of prescription fills during 2015-2019. In March 2020, there was an increased number of prescription fills for antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics in youths and adults aged 20-59&#x202f;years in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Antidepressant prescription fills increased between 13.5&#x202f;% and 31.3&#x202f;% at the end of 2020 in all age groups in Denmark and 17.4&#x202f;% in youths in Norway.

Increases of prescription fills of OAH occurred earlier in Denmark. Aggregated data with lack of information on indications. Peaks of utilization of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics observed in March 2020 may reflect medication stock piling. Increased antidepressant drug utilization in Denmark and in Norwegian youths together with the general increase in OAH utilization in the Scandinavian countries in late 2020 may indicate an increase of symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as disturbed sleep.","Tiger, Wesselhoeft, Karlsson, Handal, Bliddal, Cesta, Skurtveit, Reutfors","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.11.068","20221128","Antidepressants; Anxiolytics; Benzodiazepines; COVID-19; Drug utilization; Hypnotics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41850,""
"Efficacy of an adjuvant non-face-to-face multimodal lifestyle modification program for patients with treatment-resistant major depression: A randomized controlled trial","The high prevalence of depression is partly attributable to the poor response of patients to first-line antidepressants. Multimodal programs that promote a healthy lifestyle are successful in treating depression when used as a complementary therapy, but their medium- and long-term benefits have not been demonstrated for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The main aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a lifestyle modification program (LMP) with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and a placebo-control (written suggestions for lifestyle changes) in Spanish patients with TRD. This controlled clinical trial randomized 94 patients with TRD into 3 arms. The primary outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score at baseline, 2, 6 and 12 months. The secondary outcomes were changes in scores that evaluated quality-of-life, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity, and social support. Relative to the placebo group, the LMP and MBCT groups had significantly better quality of life (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.017; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.027), and the LMP group had significantly better adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p&lt;0.001) and reduced use of antidepressants (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036). However, the three groups showed no significant differences in BDI-II score. Only about half of the planned 180 patients were recruited, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Throwback to pre-pandemic days: A photo-elicitation study on organizational nostalgia","As an unprecedented outbreak, the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted and dramatically changed several respects of life. In terms of working life, the transition to a remote working system has brought several changes and interrupted the continuity between past and present working life. In this case, this adversity has led people to past experiences and memories, and many people have used nostalgia as a crucial resource for alleviating the negative impact of the outbreak. In this context, as a form of nostalgia, the current study particularly investigated memories eliciting organizational nostalgia and antecedents and consequences of organizational nostalgia in the pandemic era. Photo-elicitation interview in general, and participant-driven photo-elicitation in particular, was used as a data collection method. A cross-sectional design was employed for this study. In total, 10 photo-elicitation interviews through 62 photos were carried out with participants in Turkey. The thematic analysis was used for coding and analyzing the interviews. The current study demonstrated that (1) participants feel nostalgic for managers, colleagues, events, job, and working environment-related memories; (2) lack of social connectedness, loneliness, anxiety, fear, and uncertainty triggers pandemic-induced nostalgia; and (3) pandemic-induced organizational nostalgia has an impact on the variety of emotions (regret, hope, pride, freedom, joy, peace, excitement, yearning, gratitude, sadness, and happiness) of employees in the pandemic era. This study contributes to overcoming the lack of studies investigating the nostalgic emotion of employees in the pandemic era and how this emotion might contribute to overcoming the effects of COVID-19.","Tatar, M&#xfc;celdili, Erdil","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-211461","20221128","COVID-19; Nostalgia; organizational nostalgia; photo-elicitation; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41852,""
"Long-term effects of a prenatal mindfulness intervention on depressive symptoms in a diverse sample of women","Depression is a public health crisis, and scalable, affordable interventions are needed. Although many psychosocial interventions are effective, there is little research investigating their sustained, long-term influence on well-being. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a prenatal mindfulness intervention with demonstrated benefit for women's depressive symptoms during the early postpartum period would exert effects through 8 years. The sample of 162 lower income women was racially and ethnically diverse. Women were assigned to receive an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention during pregnancy (MIND) or treatment as usual (TAU). Repeated assessments of depressive symptoms were collected using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at baseline, postintervention, and following childbirth (1, 2, 3-4, 5, 6, and 8 years from baseline). The most recent assessment of depressive symptoms was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. MIND and TAU women were equivalent on sociodemographic factors and depressive symptoms at baseline. Depressive symptoms at all follow-up assessments through 8 years were significantly lower among women in MIND compared to TAU. The odds of moderate or higher depressive symptoms were greater among TAU compared to MIND women at all time points except the 6-year assessment. By Year 8, 12% of women in MIND reported moderate or more severe depressive symptoms compared to 25% of women in TAU. Results suggest the effects of a group-based psychosocial intervention during pregnancy may endure for years, well beyond the initial perinatal period. Investing in prevention and intervention efforts for mental health during pregnancy may have sustained benefits for the well-being of women.

"The emotion bias of health product consumers in the context of COVID-19","The ongoing COVID-19 has led to an increase in negative emotions and health awareness among consumers. This paper discusses the emotion bias of Chinese consumers during the three periods: the pre-COVID-19 period, the COVID-19 lockdown period, and the COVID-19 normalization period. This study takes health products as the research object and crawls relevant reviews on the JD platform to classify products. The data were classified into emotion, the intensity of emotion was calculated, and the logistic regression model and variance analysis were used to analyze the difference in emotion expression. The study reveals that consumers are willing to express fear and sadness during the COVID-19 lockdown era and are willing to express like emotions before the pandemic compared to the three periods. There are also differences in the emotional intensity of different product reviews. The intensity of emotional expression is more vigorous for consumers who purchase nutritional products, while for those who purchase healthcare equipment, the intensity of emotional expression is lower. This study offers the emotion bias of consumers in response to COVID-19 to provide a theoretical basis and reference solution for implementing marketing strategies for health product companies.","Yuan, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278219","20221128","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41854,""
"Revisiting the Black-White Mental Health Paradox During the Coronavirus Pandemic","Black Americans have lower rates of depression and anxiety than Whites, despite greater exposure to stressors known to negatively impact mental health, characterized as the Black-White mental health paradox.

The survey included a range of stressors and coping resources, including those relevant to the pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 illness) and race (e.g., witnessing anti-Black police violence). Results indicate that despite African Americans' greater exposure and vulnerability to racial discrimination, the Black-White mental health paradox holds, owing in part to protective effects of African American's higher self-esteem.

"Emerging Roles of Type-I Interferons in Neuroinflammation, Neurological Diseases, and Long-Haul COVID","Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines originally identified for their antiviral activity. IFN-&#x3b1; and IFN-&#x3b2; are both type I IFNs that have been used to treat neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Microglia, astrocytes, as well as neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including spinal cord neurons and dorsal root ganglion neurons, express type I IFN receptors (IFNARs). Type I IFNs play an active role in regulating cognition, aging, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, by suppressing neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, IFN-&#x3b1; and IFN-&#x3b2; produced potent analgesia. In this article, we discuss the role of type I IFNs in cognition, neurodegenerative diseases, and pain with a focus on neuroinflammation and neuro-glial interactions and their effects on cognition, neurodegenerative diseases, and pain. The role of type I IFNs in long-haul COVID-associated neurological disorders is also discussed.

"Family Health among Families with Primary School Children during the COVID Pandemic in Thailand, 2022","Despite evidence suggesting that the COVID pandemic has negatively affected the mental health and well-being of school aged children and parents, there are limited studies describing the state of family well-being. This study aimed to use the family health lens to assess the well-being of Thai families with primary school children and to identify its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted during January and March 2022, a period of school closure when onsite education was replaced by online education from time to time. The family health scale (FHS) questionnaire survey was carried out among 701 parents of Thai families with primary school children. The questionnaire comprised 10 questions regarding family belief, health, relationships, financial security, and housing environment. Independent variables included: (1) parental/household factors; (2) online learning related issues; (3) children's mental health; and (4) parents' health behaviors. Multinomial logistic regression was undertaken. Results showed that half of Thai families (54.6%) reported having moderate health status. Factors that were associated with lower levels of family health, such as poor or moderate levels, included families with a child that had mental health problems (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 5.0 [95% CI = 2.6-9.5] for poor v. excellent, and AOR = 2.7 [95% CI = 1.9-4.0] for moderate v. excellent), single parents (AOR = 2.5 [95% CI = 1.2-5.2] for poor v. excellent), a higher number (&#x2265;3) of children (AOR = 2.1 [95% CI = 1.0-4.0] for moderate v. excellent), and smoking parents (AOR = 6.5 [95% CI =1.2-34.8] for poor v. excellent). During health emergencies, health policy for providing adequate assistance to single parents, especially those that have a child with mental health problems, is of utmost importance. The design of health promotion activities and interventions should be targeted not only at single families, but also families with higher numbers of children and parents who smoke at home.","Pudpong, Julchoo, Sinam, Uansri, Kunpeuk, Suphanchaimat","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192215001","20221129","Thailand; children; family health; family well-being; parents; primary school; Child; Humans; Family Health; Pandemics; Thailand; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41857,""

"Access to Opioid Agonist Treatment during COVID-19 Public Transport Disruptions","Public transport disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had wide-ranging impacts on the ability of individuals to access health care. Individuals with opioid use disorder represent an especially vulnerable population due to the necessity of frequent, supervised doses of opioid agonists. Focused on Toronto, a major Canadian city suffering from the opioid epidemic, this analysis uses novel realistic routing methodologies to quantify how travel times to individuals' nearest clinics changed due to public transport disruptions from 2019 to 2020. This analysis uses entirely open-source data sources to estimate the vulnerable populations that were impacted by the largest transport disruptions in the city's history. Individuals seeking opioid agonist treatment face very constrained windows of access due to the need to manage work and other essential activities. As even small changes to travel times can lead to missed appointments and heighten the chances of overdose and death, understanding the distribution of those most impacted can help inform future policy measures to ensure adequate access to care.","Shiv Gazi Yucel et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0061-E75-69F","20221129","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; accessibility; covid-19; public transport disruptions; opioid epidemic","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","",41861,""
