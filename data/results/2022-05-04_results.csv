"Determinants of positive mental health during organizational change: role of continuous learning, mindfulness and change-efficacy","Purpose By integrating job demands-resource (JD-R) theory and organizational change approach, the paper investigates determinants of positive mental health (PMH) of employees experiencing unpredictable organizational change (i.e. transition from physical work to remote work and other associated changes during the Covid-19 pandemic). The paper aims to examine the direct and indirect effects of continuous learning (CL) and mindfulness (MF) on PMH of employees via their perceived change-efficacy (CE). Design/methodology/approach Time-lagged primary data were collected from a cohort of information technology employees experiencing organizational change in the past one year. During the first stage, data was collected on variables, including CF, MF and CE, whereas response on PMH of employees was collected after one month. AMOS-24 has been used to assess the measurement model and perform the analysis. Findings At the outset, the study affirms that CL, MF and CE significantly contribute toward PMH of employees. The mediation analysis suggests that CE significantly mediates both relationships (i.e. CL-PMH and MF-PMH). Practical implications First, CL and MF are key to recovering from a crisis and enhancing PMH of employees. Second, employees' CE is an essential ingredient for organizations to successfully implement organizational changes while amplifying the PMH of employees. Originality/value The study is one of its kind which examines the antecedents of employees' mental health during organizational change while examining the mediating role of their CE. The findings contribute substantially to the literature of organizational change and JD-R theory by integrating and extending it to organizational change context.","Budhiraja, S.; Rathi, N.","https://doi.org/10.1108/fs-08-2021-0156","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Foresight;: 16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30903,""
"Can a Behavioral Weight-Loss Intervention Change Adolescents' Food Addiction Severity?","Objective: This study examines changes in the Yale Food Addiction Scale symptom count over a 24-week, weight-loss mobile Health (mHealth) intervention incorporating elements of addiction medicine. Methods: Adolescents (n = 117) with obesity (15.5 Â± 1.3 years;66% Hispanic) were randomized to the following: (1) mHealth intervention (AppAlone), (2) mHealth intervention+coaching (AppCoach), or (3) in-person intervention (Control). A multivariate mixed Poisson regression model was used to evaluate changes in symptom counts across intervention arms after adjusting for sex, age, depressive symptomatology, stress, and executive function. Results: After the intervention, 57% of adolescents showed a decrease in symptom count (median change: -0.3 [0 to -1.5]), with a significant change by intervention arm in the intention-to-treat analysis (p = 0.045). There was a positive linear relationship between change in symptom count and change in depressive symptomatology (p &lt; 0.01) and stress (p &lt; 0.01), with no association with change in weight (p = 0.3). Discussion: Both mHealth and in-person obesity interventions seemed to confer benefits in food addiction symptomatology associated with change in mood and stress.

"Opioid use stigmatization and destigmatization in health professional social media","Stigmatization of opioid use constitutes a significant barrier to addressing the opioid crisis. Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p = .0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02â€“1.09, p = .00258). Medical Twitter experienced a 37% quarterly increase in destigmatizing tweet frequency (IRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15â€“1.64, p = .00291), and Public Health a 16% increase (IRR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.11â€“1.20, p =0.00000000373). Unfortunately, a regression discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Healthâ€™s use of destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19. While the longitudinal findings are promising, they also indicate a need for increased efforts to encourage broader use of destigmatizing language, especially post-COVID.

"Prevalence and Influencing Factors of Vicarious Traumatization among Frontline Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic","To investigate the prevalence of vicarious traumatization and its influencing factors among healthcare workers in Wuhan during a 6-month period following the last wave of Covid-19 in China, a random sampling survey was conducted among the frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (from January 20, 2020, to April 30, 2020) in first-class hospitals in Wuhan. Vicarious traumatization questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Baker Anxiety Scale, the Coping Style Questionnaire, and the Social Support Rating Scale were utilized. Results are as follows: (1) The score of vicarious traumatization of 99 health care workers was (65.79Â Â±Â 25.76), which was lower than the norm, the degree of depression was slight, but the score of anxiety was generally higher than the norm. (2) Correlation analysis and regression analysis of the results showed that depression, anxiety, coping style, and social support were the main factors that influenced vicarious traumatization. The effect of this regression analysis was 57.4%. Depression, anxiety, coping style, and social support were the main influencing factors. It is suggested that the hospital and the society should pay more attention to this group, and carry out appropriate psychological training or large-scale psychological counseling.

"Effect of loneliness and sociodemographic, health, COVID-19 pandemic-related factors on depression among older adults","The present study aimed to identify the presence of depression in older adults and the affecting factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted online with 1320 deliberately recruited older adults in Turkey between February and May 2021. The variables were depression, loneliness, fear of COVID-19, and other sociodemographic health variables. In the study, we used the Geriatric Depression Scale, Loneliness Scale, and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and RLa form including items inquiring information about sociodemographic and COVID-19 related characteristics and health conditions of the participants. In this study, we detected probable-definite depression in 73.8% of the participants. According to the results of multiple logistic regression analysis, we concluded that social and emotional loneliness, increased fear of COVID-19, perceived insufficient income, presence of chronic disease, managing activities of daily living only with assistance, irregular sleep and diet patterns, future anxiety, alcohol use, perception of mental health being negatively affected by the pandemic, and living in regions outside the Mediterranean Region affected the state of probable-definite depression in the participants. Depression was high in older adults during the pandemic. Psychosocial and health promotion interventions for depression risk factors determined from multivariate regression analysis, may enable older adults, who have become more vulnerable due to the restriction measures applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, to be less affected by this period.

"Understanding the people confined by the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative analysis","On 15 March 2020, the Spanish population was obliged to confine at home, with no time to prepare. The objective of this study was to analyse the effects this confinement had on the population. 1,044 citizens (aged 16-84) agreed to participate. The study followed a phenomenological, qualitative research design, and a non-probabilistic snowball sampling was used to recruit the sample. Seven days after the confinement began, a questionnaire including one open question was distributed through social networks, email and the media to an initial wave of participants. They were asked to redistribute it among their contacts to reach a larger and less biased sample. Three positive topics emerged from the data: calm, hope/optimism and spirituality;and 11 negative topics: concern, weariness, stress/irritability, suspicion, anxiety, sadness, longing, indignation, pessimism, depression;and two that reflected both sides: emotional alternation and resignation. Because significant psychological consequences were observed (post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger), we believe monitoring the Spanish population's mental health is necessary.

"Disparities and intersectionality in social support networks: addressing social inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought social injustice and inequalities to the forefront of global public health. Members of marginalised communities, such as racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, and persons with disabilities, have been shown to be more vulnerable to certain consequences of the pandemic. Research suggests a protective role of social support in health and wellness promotion, yet little is known about the disparities in specific social support sources (i.e., family, friends, and a significant other) between marginalised populations and their counterparts. Also unclear is the role of intersections of these marginalised identities in social support structures affected by the pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to capture and characterise such differences and intersectionality in order to address social inequalities in a time of global crisis. To that end, we surveyed U.S. adults across 45 states to examine their social support from family, friends, and a significant other. Results revealed the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on social support among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities and persons with disabilities. Additionally, we found that White individuals with a marginalised identity received less social support than their White counterparts but received a similar level of social support when compared with racial/ethnic minorities without additional marginalised identities. This article seeks to elucidate the social support disparities associated with disproportionately increased social isolation for marginalised populations due to socioeconomic disadvantages. Specific recommendations are provided for addressing issues around social disparities and inequalities. With the experience and awareness attained working with marginalised populations, mental health professionals, public health officials, and community stakeholders should be poised to attend to social capital inequalities for diversity, equity, and inclusion now and in the post-pandemic era.","Zhai, Yusen, Du, Xue","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01163-y","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 9(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30910,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Clinical Practice in Medically Based Settings: Speech-Language Pathologists' Perspectives","Purpose: Given the impact of COVID-19 on patients and the overall effects of COVID-era precautions on medical systems, the typical practice of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) has no doubt been impacted. The purpose of this study was to investigate practice patterns, experiences, and changes in referrals to medically based SLPs since the onset of COVID-19. The collective aim is to illuminate the unique perspectives and experiences of medically based SLPs during the COVID-19 era. Method: A national Qualtrics survey was conducted to capture the experiences and perspectives of SLPs in medical settings within the United States both before and since the onset of the pandemic. A total of 208 participants responded to the survey, and a mixed-methods design was implemented to examine responses regarding changes in patient populations, experiences with COVID-19 precautions, and overall impression of practice and patient impacts. Results: Results indicate SLPs in medical settings have seen a significant self-reported shift in referral patterns since the onset of COVID-19. Results of qualitative analyses revealed clinician perspectives regarding impacts to their settings in regard to COVID-19 precautions;patient flow;patient characteristics;and the mental health of staff, families, and patients. Conclusions: Overall, the impacts to SLPs' typical practice in medical systems appears to be pervasively negative and deeply interwoven from the clinician perspective. The relationships between changes in the medical systems as a whole during the pandemic era and patient population, acuity, and outcomes have created difficult practice conditions for practitioners in medical settings from the clinician vantage point.","Stead, Amanda, Vinson, Monica, Michael, Paul, Frank, Dane","https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_PERSP-21-00166","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups; 7(2):574-591, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30911,""
"Effectiveness of Videoconferencing Psychotherapy Delivered by Novice Clinicians in a Training Clinic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced care providers, including training clinics, to quickly shift mental health services to a remote modality to continue serving vulnerable populations. However, research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy delivered by novice clinicians using videoconferencing technology is limited. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of psychotherapy via videoconferencing technology, delivered by doctoral student trainees in a community training clinic. Participants (n = 34) were ethnically diverse, adult, outpatient psychotherapy clients from a large, urban setting, and the university community. Student clinicians (n = 11) were novice psychotherapy providers in their second or third year of training. Results indicated that client scores on inventories of overall distress Outcomes Questionnaire (OQ), center for epidemiological studies-depression (CES-D), and generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) decreased significantly from baseline to the most recent readministration, and Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) increased significantly. Collectively, by Session 16, symptom scores were in the typical range (below the clinical cutoff) for the OQ and GAD-7, and were one point above the CES-D clinical cutoff;by the 24th session, the average score on all measures was below the clinical cutoff, and WAI-SR scores approached the highest possible total score. Additionally, attendance during this time was quite high (87.6%) and was higher than rates during in-person service provision (80.7%). The results from this study suggest that novice clinicians can successfully use videoconferencing to deliver effective, evidence-based treatment in a community clinic, across a range of presenting concerns, and that such services can yield significant improvement of symptom distress and functioning, with patterns comparable to in-person services. Public Significance Statement Training clinics are utilized by many underserved populations, students, and residents of the surrounding area. If student trainees are able to provide effective mental health care via telehealth, that would remove barriers for many clients that might not otherwise seek treatment.","Rowen, J.; Giedgowd, G.; Demos, A.","https://doi.org/10.1037/tep0000410","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Training and Education in Professional Psychology;: 10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30912,""
"What Came Next?: Reflections on the Aftermath(s) of the 1918â€“19 Flu Pandemic in the Age of COVID","The causes for pessimism are many: despite modern medical knowledge and a robust public health infrastructure, in fall 2021 the United States tragically surpassed the 675,000 estimated total flu deaths in the 1918â€“19 pandemic (models suggest the United States will reach one million cumulative COVID-19 deaths early in 2022);too few are being or have been vaccinated, particularly among marginalized groups and the young, in a process that has taken longer than anticipated;in non-industrial, non-Western, non-urban, and less affluent areas, vaccine access had been woeful. In the United States, more than virtually anywhere else in the world, public health responses to the COVID-19 virus were politicized in new ways, weaponized to reject public health measures from closures policies and social distancing to mask and vaccine mandates. The wartime context in 1918 had generated a sort of patriotic language and push for homogeneity that, however problematic, also pressured citizens to conform to public health measuresâ€”casting those who rejected wearing masks as â€œmask slackers,â€ just as those who dodged the draft for World War I had been labeled and castigated as â€œdraft slackers.â€ Over the following years, public health measures came and went, often pushed by special interests, but starting roughly after the winter season of 1920, when a fourth wave was more deadly than either the first or third waves, influenza became something to be managed and weathered without resorting to emergency public health measures.","Christopher McKnight, Nichols, Ewing, E.

"New global WHO postnatal guidance is welcome but misses the long-term perspective","A major gap is the absence of recommendations to address the high incidence and prevalence of health and social care needs that can persist for months or even years after birth, even among apparently healthy women.2 Instead, recommendations reflect evidence derived to fit a traditional model of postnatal care that has been described as â€œnot fit for purposeâ€.6 Maternal recommendations do not tackle longer-term health impacts of prepregnancy and pregnancy complications, despite consequences for future maternal and child health.6 All women would benefit from post-partum assessment of risk for future metabolic and cardiovascular diseases to ensure those who have missed antenatal screening are identified. Given the global burden of chronic maternal morbidity and impacts on infant health,7 with more than 90% of this burden expected in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), these are important omissions. Since maternal morbidity can persist beyond the first 6 weeks after birth8 (the standard definition of the postnatal period), contacts with health workers at child health clinics within the first year of birth could be used for treatment of anaemia, screening and treatment of reproductive tract infections and cervical cancer, and provision of family planning counselling and contraception. Structured pelvic floor muscle exercises in early pregnancy for continent women could prevent onset of urinary incontinence in late pregnancy and up to 6 months postnatally, an intervention of potential benefit for millions of women.12 A recommendation that women should be screened for post-partum depression and anxiety with appropriate diagnostic and management services for those who screen positive requires considerable system change and clinical training to implement, with ongoing evaluation of benefit.","Bick, Debra, Ram, Uma, Ponnusamy, Saravanan, Temmerman, Marleen","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00616-X","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Lancet; 399(10335):1578-1580, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30915,""
"Increasing psychological distress among Californians from 2013 to 2020: Race/ethnic differences","The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is of mounting concern to population-health researchers. While early reports indicated increases in mental health problems, noticeably absent from these studies is how mental health has changed in 2020 compared to previous years (2013â€“2019) and whether such trends vary by race/ethnicity. The present study used repeated cross-sectional data from the California Health Interview Survey (nÂ =Â 168,216) to systematically document trends in psychological distress scores (Kessler-6 scale;K6) and severe psychological distress scores (K6;13+) from 2013 to 2020 and by race/ethnicity over the same period. Among all Californians we find that the reported average psychological distress scores increased by 22% between 2013 and 2020. Reported severe psychological distress scores increased 61% from 2013 to 2020. These increases were largely concentrated in the years 2017â€“2020.

"State of ambient air quality in a low-income urban settlement of South Africa","Air pollution remains one of the leading global environmental-health challenges the world is facing today, particularly within urban environments. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution has been brought back into the spotlight as both attack the human respiratory systems. The purpose of the study was to investigate the quality of ambient air in a low-income urban settlement of Jabavu during the year 2018. Air pollution and meteorological data were gathered from the South African Air Quality System (SAAQIS) network. The study focused on 3 pollutants namely PM10, SO2 and O3. Findings were that mean seasonal ambient concentrations for PM10 in summer was (28.99Âµg/m3), autumn (33.32Âµg/m3), winter (61.71Âµg/m3) and spring (48.44Âµg/m3). On the other hand, the mean seasonal ambient concentrations for SO2 was summer (4.45ppb), autumn (3.19ppb), winter (5.65ppb) and spring (3.54ppb). The O3 concentrations were summer (40.97ppb), autumn (21.01ppb), winter (15.90ppb) and spring (33.59ppb). Furthermore, the study observed that in summer, winter and spring the dominant long-range transport air masses originated from the South Atlantic Ocean, Madagascar Island-India Ocean and the Indian Ocean while in autumn the dominant air masses are short-range inland air masses. For SO2 and PM10, ambient concentrations were found to be more problematic during winter;while for O3 substantial levels were unexpectedly recorded in summer. When analysing the diurnal profiles of PM10, SO2 and O3, each of these pollutants revealed a unique distribution pattern, which, despite having seasonal variance, was consistent throughout the year. For instance, irrespective of the season, PM10 mostly peaked in the mornings and evenings;meanwhile SO2 and O3 often spiked during the midday and mid-afternoon, respectively. These findings indicate that air quality within this low-income settlement is poor. To improve air quality within low-income settlements there is a need for a shift from reliance on solid fuels to cleaner energy sources such as LP gas, biogas and solar accompanied by an increase in community awareness about air quality issues. This study contributes to knowledge building within the air quality monitoring scientific community while for policymakers it assists in policy formulation to enable air quality management.","Matandirotya, Newton R.; Moletsane, Simon D.; Matandirotya, Electdom, Burger, Roelof P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01201","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Scientific African;: e01201, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30917,""
"Are healthcare workers particularly vulnerable to loneliness? The role of social relationships and mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","Loneliness is a major public health issue with renewed prominence due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social restrictions. Healthcare workers (HCWs) may be at heightened risk, but research is lacking. We measured the prevalence of loneliness among HCWs during the pandemic in 2020 and examined pre-pandemic predictors and pandemic experiences associated with loneliness. HCWs at a designated COVID-19 hospital in Sydney, Australia completed an online survey examining health and well-being before and during the pandemic and changes to work, family and social experiences. Loneliness had negatively affected the well-being of 129 (39%) respondents (nÂ =Â 330). Pre-pandemic factors predicting loneliness were younger age (&lt;30years compared to =50years), having ever been told you had a mental health problem and living alone. These became non-significant when pandemic-related factors were added to the regression. Less contact with family and friends, increased conflict at home, and living alone or with family but not a partner, increased the odds of loneliness, while a sense of camaraderie with colleagues had the opposite effect. Psychological distress and poor mental health during the pandemic were also positively associated with loneliness. Efforts to promote congenial social contacts may be effective in averting loneliness among HCWs.","Stubbs, Joanne M.; Achat, Helen M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2022.100050","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Communications;: 100050, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30918,""

"Design, manufacture, and testing of customized sterilizable respirator","The respirator as one of the personal protective equipment is essential for industrial activities (e.g., mining, painting, woodcutting, manufacturing) for protection from contaminants in the air and during the Covid-19 pandemic to protect the wearer from infection. The respirators nowadays are commonly made of rigid plastic. They are expensive, cumbersome, and not comfortable to wear. The many components with complex structures prevent it from cleaning and reusing. We develop a practical and scalable strategy to create customized respirators with durability using computational modeling and 3D printing. It is shown that by morphing the shape according to the user's photo, the respirator is designed to fit a user's face without air leaks. Using a printing-mold-casting method, this respirator can be manufactured by silicone rubber with accuracy, which is highly durable, with its mechanics primarily not affected by sterilization. These features provide the current respirator adaptivity and convenience in carrying and storing, as well as more comfort for long-time wearing.","Xu, Ruohan, Yang, Libin, Qin, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105248","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials;: 105248, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30921,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of hospital staff: An umbrella review of 44 meta-analyses","Background Hospital staff is at high risk of developing mental health issues during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the literature lacks an overall and inclusive picture of mental health problems with comprehensive analysis among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives To ascertain the prevalence of anxiety, depression and other mental health outcomes as reported in original articles among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design A PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE 2000 compliant umbrella review of published meta-analyses of observational studies evaluating the prevalence of mental health problems in hospital staff during the pandemic. Review methods Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from December 1st, 2019, until August 13th 2021. The random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias using Egger test and LFK index was examined. Data was analyzed using STATA 17.0 software. AMSTAR-2 was applied for the quality assessment of systematic reviews, while we used GRADE to rate the quality of evidence. Results Forty-four meta-analyses from 1298 individual studies were included in the final analysis, encompassing the prevalence of 16 mental health symptoms. One-third of hospital workers reported anxiety (Prevalence: 29.9%, 95% CI:27.1% to 32.7%) and depression (Prevalence:28.4%, 95% CI:25.5% to 31.3%) symptomatology, while about 40% (95% CI: 36.9% to 42.0%) suffered from sleeping disorders. Fear-related symptoms, reduced well-being, poor quality of life, and acute stress symptoms had the highest prevalence among hospital staff. However, the quality of evidence in these areas varied from low to very low. Nurses suffered more often from sleep problems and symptoms of anxiety and depression than doctors, whereas doctors reported a higher prevalence of acute stress and post-traumatic disorders. The burden of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders was higher among female employees than their male counterparts. Remarkably, acute stress and insomnia affected more than half of first-line medical staff. Conclusions The prevalence of mental health problems among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is generally high, with anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms representing the most robust evidence based on a large dataset of prevalence meta-analyses. However, there is no strong confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome assessed. Registration Not registered.

"Disordered gaming in esports: Comparing professional and non-professional gamers","Introduction The American Psychiatric Association (APA) proposed â€˜Internet Gaming Disorderâ€™ (IGD) as a tentative disorder (APA framework) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has fully recognized â€˜Gaming Disorderâ€™ (GD) as a mental health disorder (WHO framework). These two frameworks have not yet been jointly investigated in the context of esports. The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of the APA and WHO frameworks among professional and non-professional gamers and to ascertain the suitability of existing psychometric for use in esports . Methods: A sample of 5,734 gamers (Mage = 21.47 years, SD = 6.69 years;6.94% female) recruited through an online survey prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that included an age and gender matched group of professional (n = 2,867) and non-professional gamers (n = 2,867) was investigated. Pairwise comparisons, Measurement Invariance (MI), and latent mean difference tests were conducted to distinguish the two groups. Results: Overall, professional gamers showed higher time spent gaming and prevalence of disordered gaming than non-professional gamers. Additionally, MI was supported and both disordered gaming levels and latent means were significantly higher among professional gamers when compared to non-professional gamers across both APA and WHO frameworks. Conclusions: Esports is cross-sectionally associated with greater disordered gaming vulnerability through increased time spent gaming and disordered gaming prevalence rates. Furthermore, the APA and WHO frameworks are viable in the context of esports gaming with existing assessment tools being effective in the assessment of disordered gaming in esports. The results and implications are further discussed in light of the extant literature.","Maldonado-Murciano, Laura, Guilera, Georgina, Montag, Christian, Pontes, Halley M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2022.107342","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Addictive Behaviors;: 107342, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30924,""
"Parkinson's disease and Covid-19: Is there an impact of ethnicity and the need for palliative care","Under the traditional models of care for People with Parkinson's Disease (PD, PwP), many of their needs remain unmet and a substantial burden of motor and non-motor symptoms they experience may not be tackled sufficiently. An introduction of palliative care (PC) interventions early in the course of PD offers profound benefits: it may improve quality of life of patients, their families and caregivers through the prevention and relief of medical symptoms, while, at the same time, emphasizing their emotional needs and spiritual wellbeing, establishing goals of care, and engaging in the advance care planning (ACP). The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented set of challenges for PwP and has in many ways (both directly and indirectly) magnified their suffering, thus rapidly raising the demand for PC interventions. Covid-19, as well as the repercussions of prolonged mobility restrictions and limited health-care access might exacerbate the severity of PD motor symptoms and interact negatively with a range of non-motor symptoms, with a detrimental effect on quality of life. Greater motor disability, higher amount of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations with an increased daily off-time, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, pain and worsening of cognitive complaints might dominate the clinical presentation in PwP during the Covid-19 pandemic, alongside raising psychological and spiritual concerns and anticipatory grief. Here, we aim to provide a foundation for pragmatic and clinically orientated PC approach to improve quality of life and relieve suffering of PwP in the context of the current, ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.","Rukavina, Katarina, McConvey, Victor, Ray Chaudhuri, K.; Miyasaki, Janis","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.irn.2022.03.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Review of Neurobiology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30925,""

"Adults With Hearing Loss Demonstrate Resilience During COVID-19 Pandemic: Applications for Postpandemic Services","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced unique challenges for persons with hearing loss. There is a unique concern that adults with hearing loss may be more susceptible to isolation than adults with normal hearing. This study explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of older adults with and without hearing loss. This was a longitudinal study with pre-COVID-19 and six mid-COVID-19 interviews, spanning from March 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020. The study enrolled 12 participants with hearing aids and 12 with cochlear implants aged 55-80 years that were compared to 18 age-matched adults with hearing within normal limits. Surveys were completed to evaluate the impact of time alone and loneliness, social contact, depression, and the impact of masks on hearing. A mixed-effects statistical model was used to analyze each question. Participants commonly reported stress and anxiety during monthly video calls. Adults with varying degrees of hearing loss reported decreased social interaction and increased stress during the pandemic, similar to the rates observed by participants with healthy hearing. Face coverings were commonly reported to affect the intelligibility of conversational speech. Participants with hearing loss found satisfactory methods for maintaining social connection during the pandemic that they hope will continue once restrictions ease fully. Participants from the hearing loss groups in this study were frustrated by challenges posed by facial masks and were resilient in their ability to cope with COVID-19 and found the use of technology to be helpful.

"Characteristics Associated With Loneliness and Coping Skills Utilization During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Although stay-at-home orders and physical distancing measures are vital to managing the COVID-19 outbreak, there is concern these limitations on in-person contact may increase feelings of loneliness. The present study examined loneliness in relation to living situation, psychiatric symptoms, and coping skills utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to identify demographic and psychological factors that may contribute to greater feelings of loneliness. A sample of 125 adults (18 years and older) completed measures on loneliness, psychiatric symptoms, and coping skills in September 2020. Multiple regression analysis indicated living situation moderates the relationship between hours spent having remote conversations and loneliness. Remote conversation hours were associated with decreased loneliness in those living alone but was not associated with loneliness in those living with others. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that substance use and self-blame were associated with increased loneliness whereas the use of emotional support to cope with pandemic-related stress was associated with decreased loneliness. The current study highlights the importance of finding alternative ways to remain socially connected, particularly for those living alone. Increasing access to videoconferencing technology and promoting help-seeking behaviors may be a promising approach to manage loneliness during times of increased social isolation.","Law, Belli, Boisseau","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221093744","20220503","COVID-19; Loneliness; anxiety; coping skills; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30931,""

"Longitudinal links between behavioral activation coping strategies and depressive symptoms of US adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and related physical distancing measures have posed a significant threat to the mental health of adults, particularly those living alone. Accordingly, the World Health Organization implemented the #HealthyAtHome program, encouraging people to keep in regular contact with loved ones, stay physically active, and keep a regular routine. The current study aims to examine a micro-longitudinal link between behavioral activation coping strategies (exercise, meditation, relaxation, and social connection) and depressive symptoms among adults who lived alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used 21 biweekly waves of longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between April 2020 and February 2021 (N = 1,280). The multilevel models with correlated random effects were estimated to examine lagged effects of coping strategies (t-1) on depressive symptoms (t). The results showed that exercise was predictive of lower depressive symptoms even after controlling for time-invariant and time-varying covariates. The results showed that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as taking time to exercise, may be beneficial for the mental health of Americans living in single-person households.","Kim, Yoon, Morton, Jang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267948","20220503","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30933,""
"Assessing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, shift to online learning, and social media use on the mental health of college students in the Philippines: A mixed-method study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic declared by the WHO has affected many countries rendering everyday lives halted. In the Philippines, the lockdown quarantine protocols have shifted the traditional college classes to online. The abrupt transition to online classes may bring psychological effects to college students due to continuous isolation and lack of interaction with fellow students and teachers. Our study aims to assess Filipino college students' mental health status and to estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to online learning, and social media use on mental health. In addition, facilitators or stressors that modified the mental health status of the college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine, and subsequent shift to online learning will be investigated. Mixed-method study design will be used, which will involve: (1) an online survey to 2,100 college students across the Philippines; and (2) randomly selected 20-40 key informant interviews (KIIs). Online self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) including Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Brief-COPE will be used. Moreover, socio-demographic factors, social media usage, shift to online learning factors, family history of mental health and COVID-19, and other factors that could affect mental health will also be included in the SAQ. KIIs will explore factors affecting the student's mental health, behaviors, coping mechanism, current stressors, and other emotional reactions to these stressors. Associations between mental health outcomes and possible risk factors will be estimated using generalized linear models, while a thematic approach will be made for the findings from the KIIs. Results of the study will then be triangulated and summarized. Our study has been approved by the University of the Philippines Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB 2021-099-01). The results will be actively disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journals, social media, print and broadcast media, and various stakeholder activities.","Lim, Regencia, Dela Cruz, Ho, Rodolfo, Ly-Uson, Baja","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267555","20220503","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30934,""

"COVID-19 illness and treatment decrease bone mineral density of surviving hospitalized patients","The number patients surviving COVID-19 hospitalization is steadily increasing. Follow-up management for these patients relies on an understanding of the long-term effects of COVID-19. Specifically, there are insufficient data about the lasting effects of COVID-19 on bone health. We aim in this study to evaluate whether COVID-19 illness and treatment adversely affect the bone health of surviving patients. We assessed the bone mineral density (BMD) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at diagnosis and at follow-up visits. Using the chest computed tomography (CT) scans of patients that were obtained for clinical management at diagnosis and follow-up visits, BMD was retrospectively measured by quantitative CT. The effect of COVID-19 severity markers and treatment-related factors on BMD were also assessed. BMD decreased by a mean of 8.6% (Ã‚Â± 10.5%) from diagnosis to follow-up. The follow-up visits occurred at a mean of 81 (Ã‚Â± 48) days after hospital discharge. The BMD decrease was significantly greater than expected for age-related annual BMD loss. The osteoporosis ratio increased two-fold after hospitalization for COVID-19 because of this substantial bone loss. On multivariable linear regression, only severity of COVID-19 pneumonia on initial chest CT and total steroid dose were predictive of change in BMD after COVID-19 hospitalization. Secondary osteoporosis may occur as a post-acute sequela of COVID-19. Therefore, the bone health status of patients surviving COVID-19 hospitalization should be monitored closely at follow-up visits, to facilitate the prevention and early treatment of osteoporosis complications.","BerktaÃ…Å¸, GÃƒÂ¶kÃƒÂ§ek, Hoca, Koyuncu","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202204_28636","20220503","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30936,""
"Dispensing patterns of mental health medications before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, Canada: An interrupted time series analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the general population in all aspects of life. Estimates of mental health medication dispensing in Alberta were investigated to elucidate areas of need within mental health and pharmacy practice during the pandemic. We employed an interrupted time series analysis using linear regression models to estimate community and outpatient medication dispensing trends of 46 medications used to treat mental health disorders. Three parameters were examined. The first was the medication dispensing slope before COVID-19. The second was the immediate effect of COVID-19 on dispensing (i.e., the difference in dispensing rate between the month before and after the first case of COVID-19) and the third was the medication dispensing slope during COVID-19. Dispensing rates of 61% (<i>n</i> = 34) of the examined medications remained similar before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, eight medications (i.e., amitriptyline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, and oxazepam) showed an immediate and significant increase in dispensing rate following the onset of the pandemic that was sustained over the first 13-months of the pandemic. Initial increases in dispensing patterns of antidepressants may be attributed to a ""stockpiling phenomenon"" but the sustained higher levels of dispensing suggest an unfavorable shift in the population's mental health. Monitoring of medication dispensing patterns during COVID-19 may serve as a useful indicator of the population's mental health during the current pandemic and better prepare community pharmacists in future pandemic planning, medication dispensing strategies, and care of chronic medical conditions.","Ying, Yarema, Bousman","https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174221084818","20220503","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; drug dispensing; psychotropics; trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30937,""
"Decreased Frequency of Small Talk Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Deteriorated Mental Health: Findings From Longitudinal Surveys of Middle-Aged and Older People in Japan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reduced opportunities for small talk. As small talk involves socializing, such deprivation can be stressful. This study examined the association between the change in the frequency of small talk from before to during the pandemic and the mental health of middle-aged and older people. We obtained data from web-based longitudinal surveys for members of a Japanese social networking service. People who felt their small talk frequency decreased during the pandemic compared with the prepandemic period had lower psychological well-being and greater loneliness than those who did not.

"A Preliminary Study of COVID-19-related Stressors, Parenting Stress, and Parental Psychological Well-being Among Parents of School-age Children","The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial health, social, and economic effects on families. Consequent lockdowns and school closures heightened the burden on parents of school-age children. Many parents, while working from home, had to care for their children with restricted access to caregiver resources and to support their children's education through homeschooling or remote learning provided by their schools. These duties created challenges and pressures on parents. Using online survey data collected from 197 parents of school-age (Prek-12) children during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., this preliminary study examined the relations among COVID-19-related stressors, including fear of COVID-19 and problems associated with school closures, parenting stress, and parental psychological well-being. Fear of COVID-19 and various issues associated with school closures were related to parenting stress and parental well-being. Parents with less instrumental and emotional support reported higher levels of parenting stress and lower levels of psychological well-being. The results of hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that parenting stress was the strongest predictor of parental psychological distress. Social support was associated with parental well-being but did not mediate the relation between parenting stress and parental well-being. The findings suggest that parenting stress during the COVID-19 lockdowns might take a toll on the mental health of parents of school-age children. Parents of school-age children need multiple layers of support, including targeted support addressing stressors related to school closures and parenting under quarantine.","Chen, Byrne, VÃƒÂ©lez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-022-02321-1","20220503","COVID-19; Pandemic; Parental well-being; Parenting stress; School-age children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30939,""
"Detraining and retraining in badminton athletes following 1-year COVID-19 pandemic on psychological and physiological response","Badminton is a racket sport, with fast and explosive movements and mental skills employed to anticipate the opponent's movements. The COVID-19 pandemic, led to social restriction in Brazil and sport event cancellations, subsequently, sports training was banned. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the impact of long-period detraining due to COVID-19 social restriction (8Ã‚Â months and 1-year) on cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, nutritional behavior, and profile of mood states in badminton athletes and to verify if the athletes who returned to their regular training 4Ã‚Â months earlier than athletes who stopped their daily training routine during 1-year would improve these variables. Twenty-three young badminton athletes were analyzed: retrained group (14 athletes who stopped their daily training routine for 8Ã‚Â months due to the COVID-19 pandemic plus 4Ã‚Â months of retraining), and detrained group (9 athletes who stopped their daily training routine during 1Ã‚Â year of the COVID-19 pandemic but performed home-based training). We evaluated body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, nutritional behavior, and mood states profiles. Retrained athletes showed lower body fat (-Ã‚Â 24.1% vs.Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.8%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and higher fat-free mass (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.0% vs. -Ã‚Â 0.2%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007) after 1Ã‚Â year compared with the detrained group.

We aimed to describe a systematic stepwise approach to vitreoretinal surgical training. We introduced a three-pronged approach to vitreoretinal surgical training comprising learn from home, wet lab and simulator training, and hands-on transfer of surgical skills in the operating room in our institute. Encouraging results were obtained as evaluated by feedback from the trainees about the usefulness of this three-pronged approach in developing surgical skills and building their confidence.

"Different Levels of Leisure-time Physical Activity, Coping, and Mental Health among Older Adults with Diabetes during the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 has led public health researchers to try to improve mental health among older adults with diabetes. Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) has emerged as a means of coping with mental health difficulties in the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> We extracted 301 respondents from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) based on the following criteria: over 50 years old and the onset of diabetes. We used multiple questionnaire items to assess mental health (ie, loneliness, happiness, and positive and negative affect) for older adults with diabetes. We used multivariate analysis of variance to investigate the relationships between the fixed variable (ie, LTPA) and outcome variables (ie, mental health). We categorized LTPA participation into 3 groups (ie, low, mid, and high) and examined mental health following various levels of LTPA participation. <b>Results:</b> LTPA participation showed a significant group mean differences for loneliness, happiness, and positive affect, but not for negative affect. High-LTPA respondents presented lower loneliness and higher happiness than low-LTPA respondents. High-LTPA and mid-LTPA respondents indicated higher positive affect than low-LTPA respondents. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides evidence of the benefits of LTPA on mental health for older adults with diabetes and suggests that high-LPTA involvement can be effective in promoting mental health among older adults with diabetes in the COVID-19 era.","Kim, Han","https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.46.2.7","20220503","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30942,""
"Zoom Fatigue, Psychological Distress, Life Satisfaction, and Academic Well-Being","Little is known about the psychological consequences of the recently increased utilization of videoconferencing, which has enabled life to proceed as close to normal as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the psychological consequences of this recent global lifestyle change in different populations, the psychometric validation of the Zoom Exhaustion and Fatigue Scale (ZEFS) and the relationship of this construct with academic well-being, mental well-being, and life satisfaction are presented. In a sample of 470 Turkish university students (57 percent female, <i>M<sub>age</sub></i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.26Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.18, ranging between 18 and 33 years), first-order and second-order confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the construct validity of the scale, and the item response theory results yielded appropriate item difficulty and discrimination. ZEFS scores were significantly and positively associated with anxiety, depression, and stress, and negatively associated with life satisfaction and academic well-being, supporting the scale's concurrent validity. Incremental validity was shown with mediational models demonstrating significant and separate indirect effects of Zoom exhaustion and fatigue on life satisfaction and academic well-being, both mediated by psychological distress. The results suggest ZEFS to be a valid and reliable tool to evaluate the psychological consequences of videoconferencing, which has globally increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, in non-Western samples. By showing the relationships of Zoom exhaustion and fatigue with psychological distress, life satisfaction, and academic well-being, the present study highlights potential avenues to be addressed to protect the mental well-being of all individuals who have integrated videoconferencing as part of their daily lives.","Deniz, Satici, Doenyas, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0249","20220503","COVID-19; Zoom fatigue; academic well-being; life satisfaction; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30943,""
"Psychosocial risks factors among victim support workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a study with the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire","Being a victim support worker (VSW) involves exposure to victims' suffering, pain, and traumatic events, which may trigger the risk of VSWs developing mental health problems. Psychosocial risks (PSR) and work-related stress are considered the most challenging issues in occupational safety and health, considering they impact individuals, organizations, and economies. The purpose of the present study was to identify the PSR in a sample of 196 Portuguese victim support workers (VSW) (Mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36.49; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.52). A questionnaire with socio-demographic characteristics, variables related to VSW's job, and the Portuguese medium version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire II (COPSOQ II) were used to assess these professionals' perception of PSR factors. The results reveal that although VSW recognizes some psychosocial factors favourable to their health and well-being, they also identify some PSR that place them at intermediate and severe risk, i.e., emotional and cognitive demands, which are the main areas of risk to the VSW. VSW over 38Ã‚Â years old scored higher in job insecurity, burnout, and offensive behaviours. These findings give important insights into the areas that must be enhanced in this context involving VSW. Additionally, the results highlight the relevance of encouraging a healthy and supportive work environment, preventing and promoting the health and well-being of VSW, particularly when considering the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.","Caridade, Oliveira, Saavedra, Ribeiro, Santos, Almeida, Soeiro","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00825-5","20220503","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; Occupational health and safety; Psychosocial risk (PSR); Victim support workers (VSW)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30944,""
"Effect of cognitive behavioral therapyÃ‚Â program on mental health status among medical student in Palestine during COVID pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound psychological influence on everyone in society, and the impact it had on students, particularly medical students, cannot be underestimated. The main purpose of this study is to (1) determine the prevalence of mental disorders among medical students and their associated factors, and (2) examine the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy on mental health problems among medical students. Between March and May 2021, we conducted a randomized controlled study on two phases among medical students at An-Najah National University. Data were collected using an online questionnaire and the Arabic version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We also used the MEDAS tool to assess their Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence. In the second phase, sixty-six students were recruited and assigned randomly to control and intervention groups. Intervention impact was assessed using 12-item General Health Questionnaire at two-time points; baseline, and 8Ã‚Â weeks post-intervention. The interventional model used was cognitive behavioral therapy, and the control group received no treatment. A total of 329 students were included in the analysis of the first phase of the study. Approximately 28% of students had mental health problems. We found a significant relationship between good mental health status with a higher level of physical activity level, longer sleeping hours, and shorter entertainment time (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). In the second phase of the study, a total of 91 students were included. Overall, using the CBT program showed a significant improvement in the outcome measures. At 8Ã‚Â weeks post-intervention, students had lower scores on total GHQ-12, depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction. These findings propose that adequate attention must be paid to the mental health of medical students and that CBT programs can be used for the management of mental health problems among medical students.","Hanani, Badrasawi, Zidan, Hunjul","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03915-1","20220503","Cognitive behavior therapy; General Health Questionnaire-12; Medical students; Mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30945,""
"Social alignment matters:Ã‚Â Following pandemic guidelines is associated with better wellbeing","In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, most countries implemented physical distancing measures. Many mental health experts warned that through increasing social isolation and anxiety, these measures could negatively affect psychosocial wellbeing. However, socially aligning with others by adhering to these measures may also be beneficial for wellbeing. We examined these two contrasting hypotheses using cross-national survey data (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6675) collected fortnightly from participants in 115 countries over 3Ã‚Â months at the beginning of the pandemic. Participants reported their wellbeing, perceptions of how vulnerable they were to Covid-19 (i.e., high risk of infection) and how much they, and others in their social circle and country, were adhering to the distancing measures. Linear mixed-effects models showed that being a woman, having lower educational attainment, living alone and perceived high vulnerability to Covid-19 were risk factors for poorer wellbeing. Being young (18-25) was associated with lower wellbeing, but longitudinal analyses showed that young people's wellbeing improved over 3Ã‚Â months. In contrast to widespread views that physical distancing measures negatively affect wellbeing, results showed that following the guidelines was positively associated with wellbeing even for people in high-risk groups. These findings provide an important counterpart to the idea that pandemic containment measures such as physical distancing negatively impacted wellbeing unequivocally. Despite the overall burden of the pandemic on psychosocial wellbeing, social alignment with others can still contribute to positive wellbeing. The pandemic has manifested our propensity to adapt to challenges, particularly highlighting how social alignment can forge resilience.","TunÃƒÂ§genÃƒÂ§, Newson, Sulik, Zhao, Dezecache, Deroy, Zein","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13130-y","20220503","Covid-19 lockdown; Mental health; Pandemic adherence; Social alignment; Social distancing; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30946,""
"Family experiences and perceptions of intensive care unit care and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic","In 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, visitor access to acute hospitals including intensive care units (ICUs) was initially barred, followed by a limit of one person per patient for one hour per day. This study explores the care and communication experienced by family members of ICU patients during this time. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted at an Australian quaternary hospital. Semistructured phone interviews were conducted using an aide-memoire designed to understand participants' experiences as family of a patient during this time. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed. Twenty family members of patients in the ICU participated. Three major themes were identified: 'impact of restricting visiting procedures', 'family experiences of communication', and 'care and support'. Inflexible visiting restrictions had a momentous impact on families. Participants objected to having to nominate only two people to visit during the admission and the short visiting time limit. Some family members suffered extreme stress and anxiety during their absence from the bedside. Additional challenges were experienced by rural families, visitors with disabilities, and the young children of patients who were excluded. Communication with clinicians varied. Telehealth was valued by some but not universally embraced. The relationship between staff members and families and involvement in decision-making were unaffected. Families experienced significant psychological distress from being separated from their critically ill relatives. Patient care and involvement in decision-making appeared to be unchanged, but communication with staff felt to be lacking. Better alternatives to face-to-face communication must be sought to limit the impact of family separation on mental health. Families are a key link between the patient and clinicians and often play a major role in patient support and recovery after discharge. There is an urgent need to support them and facilitate meaningful engagement despite the obstacles.","Digby, Manias, Haines, Orosz, Ihle, Bucknall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2022.03.003","20220502","COVID-19; Clinical decision-making; Communication; Family experience; Family participation; Intensive care unit; Psychological impact; Telehealth; Visitor restriction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","",30947,""
