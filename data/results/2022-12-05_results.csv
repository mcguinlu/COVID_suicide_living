"Increased insulin resistance due to Long COVID is associated with depressive symptoms and partly predicted by the inflammatory response during acute infection","Background. Some months after the remission of acute COVID-19 infection, some people show depressive symptoms, which are predicted by increased peak body temperature (PBT) and lowered blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Nevertheless, no data indicate whether Long COVID is associated with increased insulin resistance (IR) in association with depressive symptoms and immune, oxidative, and nitrosative (IO&NS) processes. Methods. We used the homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2) calculator to compute beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity and resistance (HOMA2-IR) and measured the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in 86 Long COVID patients and 39 controls. We examined the associations between the HOMA2 indices and PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and depression, IO&NS biomarkers (C-reactive protein, NLRP3 activation, myeloperoxidase, and advanced oxidation protein products) 3-4 months after the acute infection. Results. Long COVID is accompanied by increased HOMA2-IR, fasting blood glucose, and insulin levels. We found that 33.7% of the patients versus 0% of the controls had HOMA2-IR values >1.8, suggesting IR. PBT, but not SpO2, during acute infection significantly predicted IR, albeit with a small effect size. Increased IR was significantly associated with depressive symptoms as assessed with the BDI and HAMD above and beyond the effects of IO&NS pathways. There were no significant associations between increased IR and the activated IO&NS pathways during Long COVID. Conclusion. Long COVID is associated with new-onset IR in a subset of patients. Increased IR may contribute to the onset of depressive symptoms due to Long COVID by enhancing overall neurotoxicity.","Hussein Kadhem Al-Hakeim; Haneen Tahseen Al-Rubaye; Abdulsahib S.

"Approaches to engage an aging, rural cohort in southern India during the COVID-19 crisis and the psychological impact of COVID-19 in this cohort","The COVID-19 pandemic produced an unprecedented crisis across the world. Long-term cohort studies were stalled, including our longitudinal aging cohort study in rural India. We describe approaches undertaken to engage with our cohort (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1830) through multiple rounds of calls and how we provided useful services to our subjects during the lockdown period. Consenting subjects also underwent telephonic assessments for depression and anxiety using validated, self-report questionnaires. Subjects reported benefitting from our telephonic engagement strategies, including the COVID-related safety awareness and counselling service. The proportion of subjects with depression increased from 7.42% pre-COVID to 28.97% post-COVID. We envisage that such engagement strategies would improve subject rapport and cohort retention, and thus, could be adopted by similar cohort studies across the world. This marginalized, rural Indian community had severe, adverse psychological impact in this pandemic. Urgent public health measures are needed to mitigate this impact and develop appropriate preventive strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

"Promoting young people's mental health: the role of community nurses","There are growing concerns about the mental health and well-being of young people, including how these have been negatively affected by factors such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social media. Community nurses are in an ideal position to promote positive mental health and ensure timely referral to appropriate services to enable young people to access the support they need. This article explores how the pandemic and social media have affected young people's mental health, particularly in relation to anxiety.

"Why eating disorders in children and young people are increasing: implications for practice","According to data collected by NHS England in 2022 1,721 children and young people were awaiting treatment for eating disorders compared with 603 patients in 2016. This reveals an increase of 185% in eating disorders among children and young people and suggests that this increase will continue to occur even with the government pledging &#xa3;79 million ( GOV UK 2021 ) to expand children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and early intervention services ( NHS England 2022a ). This is due to the already extensive CAMHS waiting list managing the sizeable accumulation of referrals combined with the consistent increase of new referrals. This article outlines the most common types of eating disorders, the importance of the school nurse and factors that have affected the prevalence of eating disorders in young people, highlighting that early intervention and prevention is vital. The authors argue that this can be achieved through increased funding for services such as CAMHS and the First Episode and Rapid Early Intervention for Eating Disorders service, stricter legislation surrounding social media and greater mental health education in schools for teachers, young people and their families.","Hopkinson, Petty","https://doi.org/10.7748/ncyp.2022.e1445","20221205","CAMHS; COVID-19; eating disorders; school nurse; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41934,""
"Effectiveness of an online short-term audio-based mindfulness program on negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic: Latent growth curve analyses of anxiety and moderated mediation effects of anxiety between mindfulness and negative affect","This pilot study aims to explore the effects and mechanisms of a mindfulness-based intervention on negative emotions in community settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;100) were randomized into an intervention group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) and a waitlist control group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;50). Participants in the mindfulness group underwent 3&#xa0;weeks (21 sessions) of an online audio-based mindfulness-based intervention program and completed the online measures four times whereas those in the waitlist control group needed to complete the measures twice. Participants completed measures of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The results of the measures of the two groups were compared. Moderated mediation analysis was used to analyze intervention outcomes on negative affect through anxiety. Unconditional quadratic latent growth analysis was used to test the growth trajectories of anxiety. The results showed that this intervention program was effective at improving positive affect and at reducing depression, anxiety, and negative affect. The baseline anxiety moderator was found to be significant, and indirect effects of anxiety post-intervention were found between the mindfulness-based intervention and negative affect. Anxiety levels of participants were not at the same starting point and had similar but non-quadratic growth trajectories. The mindfulness-based intervention program was effective at promoting mental wellbeing and reducing mental problems in community settings in China. Mindfulness practices were beneficial to people with different anxiety levels but had more obvious benefits on anxiety and a negative affect for participants with low anxiety levels.

"Associations between trait and state perceived stress and daily moods: COVID-19 stressful experiences as a moderator","Drastically disrupting daily routines, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has posed critical mental health threats to adolescents and young adults worldwide. Many of the extant empirical findings, however, have focused on individuals' psychological adjustment during the initial phase of the pandemic. It is less clear how COVID-19 stressful experiences impact young people's daily lives in the post-pandemic ""new normal."" Drawing on 7-day diary reports, the present study fills this gap by examining: (1) how daily perceived stress impacted daily emotional adjustment; and (2) the moderating effects of COVID-19 stressful experiences on these associations among 582 Chinese young adults (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;18.12, <i>SD</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.65; 69% females). Results indicated that higher levels of both trait (i.e., average levels) and state (i.e., daily fluctuations) perceived stress were associated with greater negative and anxious moods, and that prior pandemic-related experiences exacerbated the adverse impact of both trait and state perceived stress on daily moods. Specifically, young adults reporting greater COVID-19 stressful experiences demonstrated poorer emotional adjustment (i.e., lower levels of positive mood and higher levels of negative mood) on days when they had more fluctuations in perceived stress; the aggravating impact was stronger when the average levels of perceived stress were higher. By illuminating the moderating effects of COVID-19 stressful experiences, this study contributes to the limited, but burgeoning, research examining the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on daily emotional adjustment in post-pandemic life.","Xie, Feng, Zhang, Zhang, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03955-6","20221205","COVID-19; Daily diary; Mood; Perceived stress; Trait and state","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41936,""
"School and learning contexts during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for child and youth mental health","Despite significant disruption to school during the COVID-19 pandemic, research on the impact on children is sparse. This study examines in-person and virtual learning contexts and the impact of school format on mental health (MH). Children and adolescents were recruited from community and clinical settings. Parents and children completed prospective online surveys about school experiences (November 2020) and MH symptoms (February/March 2021), including school format and activities. Standardized measures of depression, anxiety, inattention, and hyperactivity were collected. Hierarchical regression analyses tested associations between school format and MH. Children (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1011; aged 6-18&#xa0;years) attending school in-person (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;549) engaged in high levels of participation in COVID-19 health measures and low levels of social learning activities. Learning online in high school was associated with greater MH symptoms (<i>B</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.22, CI[-4.32,-.12] to <i>B</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-8.18, CI[-15.59,-.77]). Children with no previous MH condition that attended school virtually experienced a similar magnitude of MH symptoms as those with previous MH conditions. However, children who attended school in a hybrid in-person format, with no previous MH condition, experienced less hyperactivity as same-age peers with prior MH problems (<i>B</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-8.08, CI[1.58,14.58]). Children's learning environments looked very different compared to before the pandemic. Removing children from school environments and limiting opportunities that support their MH, such as social learning activities, is problematic. Efforts to address the learning contexts to protect the mental health of children are needed.","Tsujimoto, Cost, LaForge-MacKenzie, Anagnostou, Birken, Charach, Monga, Kelly, Nicolson, Georgiadis, Lee, Osokin, Arnold, Schachar, Burton, Crosbie, Korczak","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03941-y","20221205","Adolescents; Children; Covid-19; Mental health; School format; School-aged","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41937,""
"Characteristics of suicidal poisoned patients admitted to tertiary care center during COVID-19 pandemic","Suicidal poisoning is a major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic that has several physical and mental hazards. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of suicidal poisoned patients admitted to a tertiary poison control center during the pandemic lockdown and assess COVID-related knowledge and attitude among those patients to identify the high-risk group for suicide. This cross-sectional study was conducted on acutely poisoned patients admitted to Tanta University&#xa0;Poison Control Center from June to December 2020. Upon admission, socio-demographic data, causative poisoning agents, COVID-related knowledge and attitude, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) were collected from all participants. A total of 254 poisoned patients were categorized into suicidal (85.04%) and accidental (14.96%) poisoning groups. The former was caused mainly by phosphides and was significantly associated with a history of using psychotropic medications and high HAM-A and HAM-D results. Logistic regression analysis showed that a history of psychiatric illness, low attitude scores, and high HAM-D scores were significant risk factors for suicidal poisoning. Considerable number of suicidal poisoned patients had moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of providing specialized psychiatric services in poisoning centers, particularly among vulnerable populations, to prevent the overwhelming repeated suicidal attempts.

"Evaluation of depression, stress, and anxiety among women with subfertility during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study in Ahvaz, Iran","Some studies have shown that the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression have increased among subfertile women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was designed to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among subfertile women during the COVID-19 pandemic in southwest Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 190 subfertile women from two infertility centers (Imam Khomeini and Jihad) in Ahvaz, Iran. A demographic questionnaire, and the depression, anxiety, stress scale (DASS-21) were used to assess the level of depression, anxiety, and stress of subfertile women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection started in August 2021 and was completed in December 2021. Mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD or <i>N</i> (%), and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. Results showed that most women experienced moderate depression, anxiety, and stress. However, the percentage of women who experienced very severe anxiety was more than that for depression and stress, and 75 (39.5%) of women had all three disorders together. Anxiety was 0.176 units lower in women who were not affected by COVID-19 (95% CI: -5.781 to -0.629). The depression was 0.216 units lower in women with good and moderate economic status (95% CI: -5.603 to -1.178). The results of this study showed that most studied women experienced moderate depression, anxiety, and stress, but the percentages of very severe anxiety were more than that for depression and stress. Poor economic status was also a strong predictor of depression among subfertile women. Infection with COVID-19 increased the level of anxiety. Careful evaluation of subfertile women for mental health is recommended especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Afshari, Abedi, Sarizadeh, Maniati","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.967","20221205","COVID&#x2010;19; anxiety; depression; infertility; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41939,""

"Healthcare utilisation, physical activity and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown: an interrupted time-series analysis of older adults in England","COVID-19 measures which reduce interpersonal contact may be effective in containing the transmission, but their impacts on peoples' well-being and daily lives overtime remain unclear. Older adults are more vulnerable to both the virus and social isolation. It is therefore imperative to understand how they were affected during this period. Major concerns arising from the pandemic cover the aspects of mental health, healthcare utilisation and individual behavioural changes. Complementing the existing before-and-after analyses, we explore the impacts of easing and re-introducing COVID-19 measures by using a time-series data in England. The data was collected between May and November 2020 from the monthly surveys of the Platform for Research Online to Investigate Genetics and Cognition in Aging (PROTECT). Chi-squared analysis and interrupted time-series analysis were conducted to examine impacts of easing and re-introducing COVID-19 measures. Overall, mental health improves overtime but at a decreasing rate. The use of telephone/video consultations with a doctor or health professional presented a decreasing trend during the pandemic, whilst that of in-person consultation was increasing overtime. We observed significant variations in the time trends of mental health measures, healthcare utilisation and physical activity following the ease but not the re-introduction of COVID-19 measures. Future research is required to understand if these asymmetric impacts were driven by adaption of the people or stringency of the measures.

"Burnout, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Resident Physicians 18 Months Into the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Burnout among resident physicians has been an area of concern that predates the COVID-19 pandemic. With the significant turmoil during the pandemic, this study examined resident physicians' burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress as well as the benefits of engaging in activities related to wellness, mindfulness, or mental wellbeing. A cross-sectional survey of 298 residents from 13 residency programs sponsored by the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita was conducted in October and November 2021. A 31-item questionnaire measured levels of burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress. A mixed method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis tests, adjusted odds ratios (aOR), and immersion-crystallization methods were used to analyze the data. There was a 52% response rate, with 65.8% (n = 102) of the respondents reporting manifestations of burnout. Those who reported at least one manifestation of burnout experienced a higher level of emotional exhaustion (aOR = 6.73; 95% CI, 2.66-16.99; p &lt; 0.01), depression (aOR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.41; p = 0.01), anxiety (aOR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30; p = 0.04), and stress (aOR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64; p &lt; 0.01). Some wellness activities that respondents engaged in included regular physical activities, meditation and yoga, support from family and friends, religious activities, time away from work, and counseling sessions. The findings suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant rate of burnout and other negative mental health effects on resident physicians.

"Communication of the Elderly During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Restrictive measures implemented by governments around the world to control the coronavirus have an impact on communication, especially the communication of the elderly. The aim for the article is to determine the attitudes of the elderly towards the ways of communication during the COVID 19 pandemic, and to present the challenges faced by the elderly when using digital ways of communication. The goal is also to point out the importance of providing adequate social support to the elderly. The sample consisted of 71 respondents from Bosnia and Herzegovina, aged over 60 years, divided into two groups. The questionnaire was used to gather information from respondents on their demographic characteristics as well as to examine participants' attitudes and confidence regarding the manner and risk of communication associated with COVID-19. The results of this research showed that the elderly are actively using digital technologies, but that they are largely dissatisfied with their skills in using digital technologies. Most of the information during the COVID 19 pandemic is given to elderly people via television and telephone (video) conversations with family members and friends. 57.7% of the elderly stated that they greatly lacked direct communication, and it turned out that people living in elderly homes were in a slightly more favorable position. As many as 4/5 of the respondents reported feelings of anxiety, fear, loneliness, and depression. The older part of the population (those over 60 years old), especially in developing countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, is facing the challenge of ""digitization of communication"". In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly are ""calling"" for special support and the provision of training and access to technological resources in order to reduce negative psychological consequences and go one step further in creating an ""elder-friendly"" society.","Banovic, Sinanovic, Jankovic, Patkovic, Smajlovic","https://doi.org/10.5455/aim.2022.30.324-328","20221205","COVID-19; communication; elderly; third age","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41943,""
"COVID-19 Related Negative Emotions and Emotional Suppression are Associated with Greater Risk Perceptions among Emergency Nurses: A Cross-Sectional Study","As the COVID-19 pandemic began, frontline nurses experienced many emotions as they faced risks relevant to both patients (e.g., making errors resulting in patient harm) and themselves (e.g., becoming infected with COVID-19). Although emotions are often neglected in the patient safety literature, research in affective science suggests that emotions may significantly impact nurses' perceptions of risk, which can have downstream consequences. Further, the use of chronic emotion regulation strategies that are known to differ in adaptability and effectiveness (i.e., emotional suppression, reappraisal) can impact risk perceptions. To investigate the relationship between nurses' emotional experiences in response to the pandemic and their estimates of how likely they would be to experience adverse outcomes related to both patients and themselves within the next six months. Additionally, we investigated the extent to which the use of suppression and reappraisal processes to manage emotions are associated with these risk perceptions. Cross-sectional survey. Online survey distributed via email to emergency nurses at eight hospitals in the northeastern United States during fall 2020. 132 emergency nurses (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;37.05; 81.1% Female; 89.4% White). Nurses reported the extent to which they experienced a variety of positive (e.g., hope, optimism) and negative (e.g., fear, sadness) emotions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and reported their perceptions of risk to both patients and themselves. Nurses also completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, a measure of chronic tendencies to engage in emotional suppression and reappraisal. Immediately prior to providing data for this study, nurses completed an unrelated decision-making study. Nurses' negative emotions in response to COVID-19 were associated with greater perceptions of both patient safety risks (<i>b</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.31, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and personal risks (<i>b</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.34, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). The relationships between positive emotions and risk perceptions were not statistically significant (all <i>p</i> values &gt; .66). Greater chronic tendencies to suppress emotions uniquely predicted greater perceptions of patient safety risks (<i>b</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.91, <i>p</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;.036) and personal risks (<i>b</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.87, <i>p</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;.040) among nurses; however, no statistically significant relationships with reappraisal emerged (all <i>p</i> values &gt; .16). Understanding factors that influence perceptions of risk are important, given that these perceptions can motivate behaviours that may adversely impact patient safety. Such an understanding is essential to inform the development of interventions to mitigate threats to patient safety that emerge from nurses' negative emotional experiences and their use of different emotion regulation strategies.

"Use of virtual meeting and survey technology to assess Covid-19 related mental wellbeing of healthcare workers","- Healthcare workers (HCW) throughout the world have been exposed to economic and existential stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. The American Medical Association (AMA) has documented that increased healthcare burden correlates with increased HCW stress, burnout, and psychological burden. However, limits on personnel, time, and in person interactions make it challenging to assess mental health outcomes during a pandemic. This pilot test case study used virtual technology to efficiently assess these outcomes. - Data were collected based on voluntary participation in the Coping with Covid-19 for Caregiver's survey created by AMA. The survey was sent out to approximately 300 participants who included local physicians, medical residents, medical students, and allied health professionals and students who attended a virtual Mental Health Summit. - The survey was developed by the AMA, and it included questions about demographics, overall stress, fear of infection and transmission of the virus, perceived anxiety or depression due to Covid, work overload, childcare issues, and sense of meaning and purpose. The AMA allows for up to five additional questions to be added to their survey, therefore five questions regarding support service utilization, perseverance, and resilience during Covid-19, and two items to further understand students' areas of medical interest. The survey was administered using an online platform through the AMA. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. - There were 81 survey respondents. Based on the results of the survey, ""high stress"" was found in 52 (64%) participants. 66 (81%) were afraid (moderately or to a great extent) of exposure or transmission, 61 (75%) described high levels of anxiety or depression, and 67 (84%) noted work overload. Despite this increase in stress, most respondents (77%) said they were not likely to reduce their devoted hours in clinical care or research in the next 12 months, and 81% answered that they would not leave their practice or research within two years. - Covid-19 has negatively affected the wellbeing of HCW. This is a similar trend seen during other times of healthcare strain. Mental health support, work modulation, and various provisions should be explored as means to reduce Covid-related negative impacts. The use of online an online summit and online data collection methods were appropriate for collecting data on the impact of Covid on mental health. This pilot study supports the larger scale implementation of this technology for health informatics research.","Ross, Sagrera, McPherson, Gurgel Smith, Alfrad Nobel Bhuiyan, Tinsley, Goeders, Patterson, Murnane","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2022.100860","20221205","Covid-19; Healthcare workers; Louisiana; Mental health; Mental wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41945,""
"Depressive symptoms faced by non-native international medical students in China during COVID-19","This study examines depressive symptoms faced by non-native international medical students studying in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The targeted population for this cross-sectional study included non-native medical students studying in Chinese universities. This study used convenience sampling. An online, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to international medical students studying in Chinese universities from February 2020 to June 2021. The questionnaire collected demographic data, information regarding struggles faced, and used the CES-D-10 Likert scale to assess both the challenges and depression symptoms, respectively. By analyzing the 1,207 students' responses, the study found that students with poor Chinese language were two times more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.67; value of p 0.00). Moreover, female students were found more prone (76.35%) than their male counterparts (44.96%). The study found that food adaptability, health issues, accommodation issues, and financial issues were related factors contributing to depressive symptoms among non-native international medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study tried to highlight the factors that resulted in depressive symptoms among non-native international medical students, and the findings may help diplomatic representatives take necessary actions to help their citizens during this difficult time.","Xiang, Ahmad, Zhuang, Rehman, Naseem","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1037786","20221205","depressive symptoms; financial issues; language barrier; pandemic; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41946,""
"Effect of decrease of physical activity on depression and anxiety after the COVID-19 lockdown: A survey study","We focused on changes in the amount of physical activity (PA) and depression and anxiety symptoms in people, who were previously regularly physically active, as they were all members of fitness centers at time of lockdown because of COVID-19. We sampled 150 fitness center members, tested individually in facilities of fitness centers. Depression and anxiety were measured with subscales of Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and PA was measured with global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ). We found that depression (<i>t</i> = -1.97; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and anxiety (<i>t</i> = -2.66; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) was more present in female participants than male participants, single participants experienced more depression (<i>t</i> = 2.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) than participants in relationship, unemployed participants experienced more depression (<i>F</i> = 3,24; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and anxiety (<i>F</i> = 5,32; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) than employed participants and participants with lower levels of education experienced higher levels of affective depression (<i>F</i> = 3,42; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and physiological anxiety (<i>F</i> = 3,72; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) than participants with higher levels of education. Finally, we found that mental health can be influenced by changes in amount of movement-both anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) (in whole and its specific dimensions) increased for male participants when there is less strenuous work-related activity, less walking, or cycling to work and when they would spend more time each day sitting. For female participants, affective depression (<i>t</i> = 3.78; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and anxiety (<i>t</i> = 3.23; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) increased with increased sitting time. Ex-competitive athletes are particularly immune to anxiety (<i>t</i> = -2.18; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and depression (<i>t</i> = -2.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). As in some previous studies, our results show that because of lockdown, the most endangered groups for mood disorders are women, singles, unemployed and students, uneducated people and those, who had less PA, and more sitting time. Additionally, those who had some sport competitive history are less endangered for depression and anxiety. Isolation has great impact on mental health, the most effective solution to stress relief and anxiety is physical exercise, which was limited or non-existent in the time of pandemic. Ex-professional athletes are especially immune to anxiety and depression in events such as COVID-19 lockdown. For future studies we recommend focusing on likelihood of increased depression and anxiety levels in individuals, who were physically active before the isolation period.","Kajtna, Vu&#x10d;kovi&#x107;","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.961798","20221205","COVID-19 epidemic; anxiety; depression; physical activity; sedentary behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41947,""
"Prevalence of anxiety, depressive and insomnia symptoms among the different groups of people during COVID-19 pandemic: An overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses","Since the pandemic of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in addition to the harm caused by the disease itself, the psychological damage caused to the public by the pandemic is also a serious problem. The aim of our study was to summarize the systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) of the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia in different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and to qualitatively evaluate these SRs/MAs. We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of Science to obtain SRs/MAs related to anxiety, depression, and insomnia in different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main populations we studied were healthcare workers (HCWs), college students (CSs), COVID-19 patients (CPs), and the general populations (GPs). A subgroup analysis was performed of the prevalence of psychological disorders. A total of 42 SRs/MAs (8,200,330 participants) were included in calculating and assessing the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in these populations. The results of subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety in different populations were: HCWs (20-44%), CSs (24-41%), CPs (15-47%), and GPs (22-38%). The prevalence of depression were: HCWs (22-38%), CSs (22-52%), CPs (38-45%), and GPs (16-35%), statistically significant differences between subgroups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of insomnia were: HCWs (28-45%), CSs (27-33%), CPs (34-48%), and GPs (28-35%), statistically significant differences between subgroups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The comparison revealed a higher prevalence of psychological disorders in the CP group, with insomnia being the most pronounced. The methodological quality of the included SRs/MAs was then evaluated using AMSTAR 2 tool. The results of the methodological quality evaluation showed that 13 SRs/MAs were rated ""medium,"" 13 were rated ""low,"" and 16 were rated ""very low."" Through the subgroup analysis and evaluation of methodological quality, we found a higher prevalence of insomnia than anxiety and depression among the psychological disorders occurring in different populations during the pandemic, but the sample size on insomnia is small and more high-quality studies are needed to complement our findings.","Zou, Tang, Jiang, Lin, Tian, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1024668","20221205","AMSTAR 2; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; insomnia; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41948,""
"Knowledge development visualization and mapping path of the psychological capital research","With the respect to the key factors, namely the psychological state of individuals and organizations, psychological capital (PsyCap) is widely used in various fields, such as management decisions and organizational behavior. To fully show the related studies and their knowledge development and mapping path, in this paper, we examine 2,786 papers about the PsyCap related research from 1970 to 2021. Based on the bibliometric analysis and main path demonstration (the tools are Cite-Space and Pajke, respectively), we derive some conclusions as follows: (1) the publication number about the PsyCap study is growing rapidly and it is a highly cross-cutting research topic. (2) The main authors come from Australia, the United States, and China, and also are the core researchers. (3) Refinement and measurement in the PsyCap study are constant and hot topics. (4) Stress, performance and well-being issues among students, health care workers and corporate employees are core research themes, and team organization, creativity, innovation, and COVID-19 are hot topics in this field. The bibliometric analysis are quantitatively analyzed to provide scholars with a more comprehensive insight into PsyCap research.

"Emerging adults' digital technology engagement and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Within the past decade, parents, scientists, and policy makers have sought to understand how digital technology engagement may exacerbate or ameliorate young people's mental health symptoms, a concern that has intensified amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous research has been far from conclusive, and a lack of research consensus may stem in part from widely varying measurement strategies (including subjective and objective measurement) around digital technology engagement. In a cross-sectional study of 323 university students, the present study seeks to understand the ways in which youth engagement with digital technology - across subjective and objective measurements, weekday and weekend distinctions, and social and non-social uses - is associated with mental health (as measured by depression, loneliness, and multidimensional mood and anxiety). The present study also tested a differential susceptibility hypothesis to examine whether COVID-19 related social isolation might exacerbate the potential harms or helps of digital technology engagement. Results yielded few observed associations between digital technology engagement and mental health, with little evidence of detrimental effects of observed or perceived time spent on digital technology. Rather, those significant findings which did emerge underscore potential protections conferred by social connections with friends (both online and offline), and that the loneliest students may be the most likely to be reaching out for these types of connections. It is important that the field move beyond crude (largely self-reported) measures of screen time to instead understand how and to what effect youth are using digital technologies, especially during the social corridor of emerging adulthood.","Chase, Brown, Jensen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1023514","20221205","COVID-19; digital technology; emerging adulthood; mental health; screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41950,""
"Early psychological intervention in adult patients after hospitalization during COVID-19 pandemia A single center observational study","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has represented an individual and collective trauma with an impact on mental health. COVID-19 survivors need to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. After March 2020, an outpatients clinic for follow up of discharged COVID-19 patients was set up at Infectious Diseases Department of the Hospital of Lecco, Italy. Blood exams, specialistic visits were performed for each patients and IES-R and BDI scales were dispensed. 523 patients were referred to the clinic; 93 of them resulted positive at IES-R and/or BDI self-report and 58 agreed to have early interviews with psychologist specialist. Patients could receive only a short psychoeducation/psychological support intervention or in addition to the same, even a specific trauma-focused psychotherapeutic intervention with EMDR where clinically indicated. IES-R e BDI were administered pre- and post-intervention. The results show that the average of the post-traumatic stress scores detected at IES-R is above the clinical cut-off for the entire sample. There is an overall change in the decrease in mean scores on the IES and BDI scales before and after psychological intervention. Among the patients for whom psychopharmacological therapy was also necessary, those who had COVID-mourning in family improved the most at IES-R scale post- intervention. With respect to EMDR treatment, there is a significant improvement in depressive symptoms noticed at BDI for male patients who have received neither psychotropic drugs nor CPAP. Being hospitalized for coronavirus has a significant impact on the patient's mental health and it is a priority to arrange early screening to intercept psychological distress and give it an early response.","Lazzaroni, Tosi, Pontiggia, Ermolli, Borghesi, Rigamonti, Frisone, Piconi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1059134","20221205","COVID-19 survivors; EMDR; hospitalization; prevention; psychological support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41951,""

"""The whole sky has broken down on me I might die alone"": A qualitative study on the lived experiences of COVID-19 positive frontline workers in Bangladesh","Many countries, including Bangladesh, have conducted research on the mental health of frontline workers and their challenges in adjusting to their new workplaces. However, the authors are unaware of any studies on their real-life experiences as COVID-19-positive patients in Bangladesh. This study intends to investigate the lived experiences of Bangladeshi frontline workers who were isolated as a result of the COVID-19 infection and tested positive for the virus. We used a qualitative methodology and a semi-structured interview guide to conduct ten interviews between July 26 and August 12, 2020. The participants were recruited <i>via</i> a social media campaign and purposive sampling. All interviews were conducted <i>via</i> telephone and online and were transcribed and analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. The study does, however, identify four primary themes and 13 supporting themes, including (1) experience in a new working environment (subthemes: workload and adaptation, maintaining health protocol and social distance, and the fear of infection), (2) diagnosis (subthemes: the origin of infection, physiological problems, experiences at the diagnosis center), (3) recovery days (subthemes: earlier reactions, experiences in isolation, coping mechanisms), and (4) post-COVID-19 (subthemes: excitement, fear, and confusion; physiological problems; increased religiosity; and changes in philosophy). This study is important for healthcare policymakers because it helps them design healthcare management systems that take Bangladeshi society's social context into account. This study also recommends that long-term behavioral change programs be implemented by national policymakers to lessen societal stigma. At the same time, it suggests that the government should help lessen the barriers to health care services that persons with lower socioeconomic status confront.","Arefin, Rashid, Bhattacharjee, Habib, Islam, Rahaman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2022.1054921","20221205","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Colaizzi method; frontline Workers; lived experiences; phenomenology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41954,""
"Assessment of mental health of medical personnel during COVID-19: insights from Pakistan","The purpose of this paper is to examine how fear of COVID-19 affects: <i>i)</i> psychological distress; and <i>ii)</i> anxiety among healthcare workers. Additionally, the possible mediating role of passion was conceptually hypothesized and empirically tested in these two relationships. Data were collected from 360 healthcare employees working at hospitals in Pakistan. AMOS (v.26) was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to test hypotheses and relationships. The results of the study revealed the fear of COVID-19, the psychological distress, and anxiety of medical personnel have positive connections. There is now strong evidence that fear of COVID-19 substantially influences anxiety and psychological distress. In particular, the results demonstrate that passion did not mediate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and employees' mental health. It concludes that the outcomes of this work support the presence of a significant association between COVID-19 fear and the mental health of medical staff in Pakistan.

"Excess mortality in Poland during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020","The aim of the study was to analyse excess deaths by major causes of death and associated changes in the mortality pattern of the Polish population in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study used data on all deaths in Poland which occurred between 2010 and 2020 (<i>N</i> = 3,912,237). 10-year mortality trends for 2010-2019 were determined. An analysis of time trends has been carried out with joinpoint models and Joinpoint Regression Program. Based on the determined regression models, the number of deaths expected in 2020 and the number of excess deaths due to selected causes were calculated. The crude death rates of all-cause deaths increased from 2000 to 2019 at an average annual rate of 1% (<i>p</i> = 0.0007). The determined regression model revealed that the number of deaths in 2020 should have been 413,318 (95% CI: 411,252 to 415,385). In reality, 477,355 people died in Poland that year. The number of excess deaths was therefore 64,037 (15.5%). According to data from Statistics Poland the number of COVID-19-related deaths was 40,028, the number of non-COVID-19 deaths was 24,009. The largest percentage increase over the expected number of deaths was observed for suicide (12.5%), mental and behavioral disorders (7.2%) and diseases of circulatory system (5.9%). A lower than expected number of deaths was observed for malignant neoplasms (-3.2%) and transport accidents (-0.1%). The difference between expected and observed non-COVID-19 deaths in 2020 indicates a need for further analysis of the causes of excess mortality.","Pikala, Krzywicka, Burzy&#x144;ska","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1048659","20221205","COVID-19; Poland; causes of death; estimation; excess mortality; mortality trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41956,""
"Adjusting intervention strategies for mental health of COVID-19 patients: A network analysis based on a survey in Omicron-infected patients","The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on people's mental health. As the SAS-Cov-2 evolves to become less virulent, the number of asymptomatic patients increases. It remains unclear if the mild symptoms are associated with mild perceived stress and mental illness, and the interventions to improve the mental health of the patients are rarely reported. This cross-sectional study investigated the level of depression, anxiety and perceived stress of 1,305 COVID-19 patients who received treatment in the Fangcang shelter hospitals in Shanghai, China. Network analysis was used to explore the relationship among depression, anxiety and perceived stress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and perceived stress in the patients with Omicron infection were 9.03, 4.60, and 17.03%, respectively, lower than the prevalence reported during the initial outbreak of COVID-19.

This study examines pandemic-related isolation and its psychological impact on Chinese college students and explores the relationships among COVID-19 burnout, resilience, and psychological distress in Chinese college students during the pandemic. The COVID-19 Burnout Scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Brief Symptom Inventory were used to investigate 388 college students from Nanjing City, China. All participants were enrolled in university after 2019, and they participated in the survey voluntarily <i>via</i> the Internet. Participants were divided into two groups (isolated group vs. non-isolated group) based on whether or not they had been isolated. (1) Significantly lower scores were found for all factors in the isolated group; (2) COVID-19 burnout significantly negatively predicted resilience and significantly positively predicted psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms), while resilience significantly negatively predicted psychological distress; and (3) Resilience mediated the relationship between COVID-19 burnout and psychological distress. Isolation is a risk factor for psychological distress related to COVID-19. Resilience can buffer psychological distress and help improve Chinese college students' wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sun, Zhu, ChenHuang, Zhu, Yang, Zhang, Zheng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1009027","20221205","COVID-19 burnout; China; mental health; resilience; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41958,""
"Latent profile analysis of security among patients with COVID-19 infection in mobile cabin hospitals and its relationship with psychological capital","COVID-19 patients' security is related to their mental health. However, the classification of this group's sense of security is still unclear. The aim of our research is to clarify the subtypes of security of patients infected with COVID-19, explore the factors affecting profile membership, and examine the relationship between security and psychological capital for the purpose of providing a reference for improving patients' sense of security and mental health. A total of 650 COVID-19 patients in a mobile cabin hospital were selected for a cross-sectional survey from April to May 2022. They completed online self-report questionnaires that included a demographic questionnaire, security scale, and psychological capital scale. Data analysis included latent profile analysis, variance analysis, the Chi-square test, multiple comparisons, multivariate logistical regression, and hierarchical regression analysis. Three latent profiles were identified-low security (Class 1), moderate security (Class 2), and high security (Class 3)-accounting for 12.00, 49.51, and 38.49% of the total surveyed patients, respectively. In terms of the score of security and its two dimensions, Class 3 was higher than Class 2, and Class 2 was higher than Class 1 (all P &lt; 0.001). Patients with difficulty falling asleep, sleep quality as usual, and lower tenacity were more likely to be grouped into Class 1 rather than Class 3; Patients from families with a per capita monthly household income &lt;3,000 and lower self-efficacy and hope were more likely to be grouped into Classes 1 and 2 than into Class 3. Psychological capital was an important predictor of security, which could independently explain 18.70% of the variation in the patients' security. Security has different classification features among patients with COVID-19 infection in mobile cabin hospitals. The security of over half of the patients surveyed is at the lower or middle level, and psychological capital is an important predictor of the patients' security. Medical staff should actively pay attention to patients with low security and help them to improve their security level and psychological capital.","Wu, Yan, He, Wu, Zhang, Du, Lin, Zhang, Heng, Lang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.993831","20221205","latent profile analysis; mobile cabin hospital; patients with COVID-19 infection; psychological capital; security","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41959,""
"Multiple health risk behaviors, including high consumption of ultra-processed foods and their implications for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The growing increase in diet- and behavior-related illnesses has drawn the attention of many epidemiologists who attribute such changes to the epidemiological and nutritional transition. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the association between the combined occurrence of health risk behaviors, such as sedentary lifestyles, high weekly consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), and non-daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, and symptoms of anxiety or depression in adults. This is a cross-sectional study based on an epidemiological survey in two Brazilian cities. The outcome, anxiety, and depression symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Food consumption was assessed using a qualitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with reference to consumption in the last 3 months and categorized into the consumption of fruits and vegetables and the consumption of UPFs according to the NOVA classification. Sedentary behavior was assessed by considering the amount of sitting or reclining time per day reported by participants and categorized as less than 9 h of sitting or reclining and 9 h or more. For the analysis, adjusted Poisson regression (PR) was used to estimate the prevalence ratio and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Those with the health risk behaviors, non-daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, and high consumption of UPFs had a 2.6 higher prevalence ratio for symptoms of mental disorder (PR: 2.6 and 95%CI: 1.1-6.5), as well as those with all three health risk behaviors, had a 2.8 higher prevalence ratio for symptoms of mental disorder (PR: 2.8 and 95%CI: 1.3-6.1). This study revealed that the existence of a combination of two and three health risk behaviors led to a higher prevalence of symptoms of anxiety or depression.","Coletro, Mendon&#xe7;a, Meireles, Machado-Coelho, de Menezes","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.1042425","20221205","anxiety; depression; fruit and vegetable consumption; risk behaviors; sedentary behavior; ultra-processed food","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41960,""
"Barriers to participation in tourism linked respite care","Successive interventions designed to curb the spread of COVID-19 have all served to exacerbate the demands placed upon informal carers, a population indispensable to health care systems. The need for breaks from caring has never been so pronounced. This paper adopts, and extends, the theory of hierarchical leisure constraints to better understand barriers to tourism respite participation. Lived experiences are collected via story-telling techniques (n = 157) from carers taking trips of one night or more away during times of palliative and end-of-life care. Three cross-cutting constraints are emergent in the data: <i>awareness (knowing); access (doing); and anxiety (feeling)</i>. Negotiation strategies are suggested, hierarchical implications questioned and the opportunity to explore a temporal dimension to tourism constraints in future research signalled.","Hunter-Jones, Sudbury-Riley, Chan, Al-Abdin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2022.103508","20221205","Ageing population; Hospices; Informal carers; Temporality; Theory of hierarchical leisure constraints; Trajectory touchpoint technique","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41961,""
"Surveillance to improve physical activity of children and adolescents","The global transition to current low levels of habitual physical activity among children and adolescents began in the second half of the last century. Low physical activity harms health in both the short term (during childhood and adolescence) and long term (during adulthood). In turn, low physical activity could limit progress towards several sustainable development goals, undermine noncommunicable disease prevention, delay physical and mental health recovery from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, increase health-care costs and hinder responses to climate change. However, despite the importance of physical activity, public health surveillance among children and adolescents is very limited globally and low levels of physical activity in children is not on the public health agenda in many countries, irrespective of their level of economic development. This article details proposals for improvements in global public health surveillance of physical activity from birth to adolescence based on recent systematic reviews, international collaborations and World Health Organization guidelines and strategies. Empirical examples from several countries illustrate how improved surveillance of physical activity can lead to public health initiatives. Moreover, better surveillance raises awareness of the extent of physical inactivity, thereby making an invisible problem visible, and can lead to greater capacity in physical activity policy and practice. The time has arrived for a step change towards more systematic physical activity surveillance from infancy onwards that could help inform and inspire changes in public health policy and practice globally. Durant la seconde moiti&#xe9; du si&#xe8;cle dernier, l'activit&#xe9; physique des enfants et adolescents a commenc&#xe9; &#xe0; baisser &#xe0; l'&#xe9;chelle mondiale pour atteindre le faible niveau actuel. La s&#xe9;dentarit&#xe9; a des effets n&#xe9;fastes sur la sant&#xe9;, tant &#xe0; court terme (pendant l'enfance et l'adolescence) qu'&#xe0; long terme (&#xe0; l'&#xe2;ge adulte). Elle peut &#xe9;galement entraver la progression vers de nombreux objectifs de d&#xe9;veloppement durable, compromettre les efforts de pr&#xe9;vention des maladies non transmissibles, retarder la gu&#xe9;rison physique et mentale li&#xe9;e &#xe0; la pand&#xe9;mie de maladie &#xe0; coronavirus 2019, accro&#xee;tre les d&#xe9;penses en soins de sant&#xe9; et freiner les r&#xe9;actions au changement climatique. Pourtant, malgr&#xe9; l'importance que rev&#xea;t l'activit&#xe9; physique, rares sont les dispositifs de surveillance de la sant&#xe9; publique mis en place pour les enfants et adolescents dans le monde. En outre, la lutte contre la s&#xe9;dentarit&#xe9; chez les plus jeunes ne figure pas parmi les priorit&#xe9;s de sant&#xe9; publique dans la plupart des pays, quel que soit le niveau de d&#xe9;veloppement &#xe9;conomique de ces derniers. Le pr&#xe9;sent article d&#xe9;taille une s&#xe9;rie de propositions visant &#xe0; am&#xe9;liorer la surveillance de la sant&#xe9; publique en mati&#xe8;re d'activit&#xe9; physique de la naissance &#xe0; l'adolescence, fond&#xe9;es sur des revues syst&#xe9;matiques r&#xe9;centes, des collaborations internationales ainsi que des strat&#xe9;gies et lignes directrices de l'Organisation mondiale de la Sant&#xe9;. Des exemples empiriques provenant de plusieurs pays illustrent comment cette am&#xe9;lioration peut d&#xe9;boucher sur des initiatives de sant&#xe9; publique. De plus, une meilleure surveillance permet de sensibiliser &#xe0; l'ampleur de cette inactivit&#xe9;, donnant ainsi de la visibilit&#xe9; &#xe0; un probl&#xe8;me jusqu'alors invisible, et peut renforcer les capacit&#xe9;s politiques et pratiques relatives &#xe0; l'activit&#xe9; physique. Il est temps de proc&#xe9;der &#xe0; un changement en profondeur afin de surveiller plus syst&#xe9;matiquement l'activit&#xe9; physique d&#xe8;s le plus jeune &#xe2;ge, en vue d'orienter et d'encourager l'&#xe9;volution des politiques et pratiques en la mati&#xe8;re dans le monde. La transici&#xf3;n mundial hacia los niveles bajos actuales de actividad f&#xed;sica regular entre ni&#xf1;os y adolescentes comenz&#xf3; en la segunda mitad del siglo pasado. La disminuci&#xf3;n de la actividad f&#xed;sica perjudica la salud tanto a corto plazo (durante la infancia y la adolescencia) como a largo plazo (durante la edad adulta). A su vez, la falta de actividad f&#xed;sica podr&#xed;a limitar el progreso hacia varios objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, socavar la prevenci&#xf3;n de enfermedades no transmisibles, retrasar la recuperaci&#xf3;n de la salud f&#xed;sica y mental tras la pandemia de la enfermedad por coronavirus de 2019, aumentar los costes de la atenci&#xf3;n sanitaria y dificultar las respuestas al cambio clim&#xe1;tico. No obstante, a pesar de la importancia de la actividad f&#xed;sica, la vigilancia de la salud p&#xfa;blica entre los ni&#xf1;os y los adolescentes es muy limitada a nivel mundial y los niveles bajos de actividad f&#xed;sica en los ni&#xf1;os no se incluyen en la agenda de salud p&#xfa;blica de muchos pa&#xed;ses, sea cual sea su nivel de desarrollo econ&#xf3;mico. En este art&#xed;culo, se detallan propuestas para mejorar la vigilancia de la actividad f&#xed;sica en la salud p&#xfa;blica a nivel mundial, desde el nacimiento hasta la adolescencia, a partir de recientes revisiones sistem&#xe1;ticas, colaboraciones internacionales y directrices y estrategias de la Organizaci&#xf3;n Mundial de la Salud. Ejemplos emp&#xed;ricos de varios pa&#xed;ses ilustran c&#xf3;mo una mejor vigilancia de la actividad f&#xed;sica puede conducir a iniciativas de salud p&#xfa;blica. Asimismo, una mejor vigilancia aumenta la concienciaci&#xf3;n sobre el alcance de la inactividad f&#xed;sica, haciendo evidente un problema poco visible, y puede conducir a una mayor capacidad en la pol&#xed;tica y la pr&#xe1;ctica de la actividad f&#xed;sica. Ha llegado el momento de dar un paso adelante hacia una vigilancia m&#xe1;s sistem&#xe1;tica de la actividad f&#xed;sica desde la infancia que podr&#xed;a ayudar a informar e inspirar cambios en la pol&#xed;tica y la pr&#xe1;ctica de la salud p&#xfa;blica en todo el mundo. &#x628;&#x62f;&#x623;

"Psychosocial Influences on Coping and Wellbeing during the Covid-19 Lockdown in the Early Days of the Pandemic: A Mixed Methods Research","This study focuses on the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on wellbeing and uses a mixed methods design to develop a more profound understanding about adaptive coping during stressful situations. The quantitative phase of this study examined the association between psychological capital, perceived stress, coping and wellbeing. The online survey was conducted in May 2020 and had 257 participants. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) results showed that the hypothesized model had an adequate fit [&#x3c7;2(306, <i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;257)&#x2009;=&#x2009;547.185, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00]; and that both psychological capital and perceived stress were significant predictors of wellbeing. Significantly, young people reported a more negative impact on their wellbeing during the lockdowns. In the subsequent qualitative phase, in-depth interviews with 21 voluntary participants (14 females and 7 males) suggested that individuals could reappraise stressful situations and use coping strategies for psychosocial adaptation. From this research, it was identified that especially the younger age group is at risk, and that that psychosocial resources, such as psychological capital, could be developed to enhance coping and wellbeing with the ongoing impacts of the pandemic.","Mohan, Peungposop, Kalra","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11482-022-10115-2","20221205","COVID-19; Life satisfaction; Perceived stress; Positive mental health; Psychological capital; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41963,""
"Psychological Distress, Anxiety, Depression, and Associated Factors Among Nigerian Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Objectives:</b> We determined the prevalence of psychological distress, and the associations between sociodemographic factors, anxiety, depression, COVID-19-related experiences, and psychological distress, among nurses and doctors in Nigeria. <b>Methods:</b> The study was a cross-sectional descriptive study, conducted over a month (1st of July-31st of July 2021) among 434 Health Care Workers (HCWs) [225 (51.8%) nurses and 209 (48.2%) doctors] from two tertiary health facilities in southwestern Nigeria. Binary logistic regression was carried out to determine the factors associated with psychological distress (dependent variable), while the independent variables were anxiety, depression, and COVID-19 experience-related factors. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of moderate and severe psychological distress was 49.1% and 5.8%, respectively. Individuals who had the first degree had significantly lower odds (AOR: 0.43; <i>p</i> = 0.037) of experiencing psychological distress while being a nurse (AOR: 2.03; <i>p</i> = 0.014), higher levels of anxiety (1.28; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and depression (AOR: 1.17; <i>p</i> = 0.005) were associated with significantly higher odds of experiencing moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. <b>Conclusion:</b> There is a high level of psychological distress experienced by these health workers. Hence, they will benefit from strategies to reduce their distress.","Ibigbami, Akinsulore, Opakunle, Seun-Fadipe, Oginni, Okorie, Oloniniyi, Olibamoyo, Aloba, Mapayi, Adewuya","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2022.1604835","20221205","COVID 19 pandemic; Nigeria; anxiety; depression; doctors; nurses; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41964,""
"Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on People with Severe and Persistent Mental Illness within Rehabilitation Services: A Thematic Analysis","The COVID 19 pandemic has required major changes in healthcare delivery. This study sought to understand the impact of the mental healthcare changes associated with COVID-19 on people living with severe and persisting mental illness (SPMI) and staff working in rehabilitation teams in Queensland in Australia. Telephone interviews were completed with participants diagnosed with SPMI who were supported by the rehabilitation teams of a public mental health service (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18). Additionally, an anonymous survey was completed with staff from these teams (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20, 17.5% of staff). Both datasets were analysed separately using thematic analysis. Four themes were identified through the analysis of the patient interviews: wishing the whole thing would go away; [COVID-19 has] delayed my recovery; being more socially aware; and (you've) got to be clean (which is a) good thing. Four themes emerged through the analysis of the staff survey data: needing to change the model of care; impact on patients, the impact on staff, positive impact. The perceived impact on participant's mental health was like that which was reported in the general population. Participants' emphasised anxiety, loneliness, boredom, and depression rather than a relapse of their primary psychotic illness. Participants noted the pandemic slowed the pace of personal recovery and limited the delivery of specialised rehabilitation programs.

"Depression, Suicidal Ideation, and Consumption of Psychotropic Drugs During Lockdown by COVID-19 According to Gender and Age","The objective was to analyze the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation and psychotropic drugs use during COVID-19 lockdown in adult population considering gender and age. The method used is a descriptive and non-probabilistic study, with a convenience sampling of 3780 participants (70.1% female), aged 18-64&#xa0;years (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;37.8). 18.3% participants presented depression and 5.1% exhibited suicidal ideation. The depression rate for female was double (21.4%) than male and 5 times higher (30.2%) for the youngest participants (18-24&#xa0;years old) compared to oldest (55-64&#xa0;years old), being this rate triple in suicidal ideation (9%). Depression correlated positively with tranquilizers and sleeping pills' consumption; and suicidal ideation did so with tranquilizers and sedatives. The rate of tranquilizer users was 8 times higher for severe depression compared to those who did not present depression, 5 times higher for sleeping pills, and 6 times higher for sedatives. The rate of tranquilizer users exhibiting suicidal ideation was more than triple than those who did not present suicidal ideation, between 3 and 4 times higher for sleeping pills, and almost 7 times higher for sedatives. The higher the level of depression and suicidal ideation during lockdown, the greater the consumption of psychotropic drugs. The consumption of psychotropic drugs should be monitored in people with depression and suicidal ideation during periods of crisis.","Villanueva-Blasco, Villanueva-Silvestre, V&#xe1;zquez-Mart&#xed;nez, de Vicente, P&#xe9;rez-G&#xe1;lvez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00962-3","20221205","Age; COVID-19; Depression; Gender; Lockdown; Psychotropic drugs; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41966,""
"Systemic Challenges in Internship Training for Health-Service Psychology: A Call to Action From Trainee Stakeholders","The challenges observed in health service psychology (HSP) training during COVID-19 revealed systemic and philosophical issues that preexisted the pandemic, but became more visible during the global health crisis. In a position paper written by 23 trainees across different sites and training specializations, the authors use lessons learned from COVID-19 as a touchstone for a call to action in HSP training. Historically, trainee voices have been conspicuously absent from literature about clinical training. We describe longstanding dilemmas in HSP training that were exacerbated by the pandemic and will continue to require resolution after the pandemic has subsided. The authors make recommendations for systems-level changes that would advance equity and sustainability in HSP training. This article advances the conversation about HSP training by including the perspective of trainees as essential stakeholders.","Palitsky, Kaplan, Brodt, Anderson, Athey, Coffino, Egbert, Hallowell, Han, Hartmann, Herbitter, Herrera Legon, Hughes, Jao, Kassel, Le, Levin-Aspenson, L&#xf3;pez, Maroney, Medrano, Reznik, Rogers, Stevenson","https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026211072232","20221205","Diversity Equity and Inclusion; Health Service Psychology; Professional Standards; Public Mental Health Systems; Training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41967,""
"Mental Health of Emergency Department Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 in Brooklyn, New York","Maintaining good mental health among Emergency Department healthcare workers (ED HCW) is paramount to well-functioning healthcare. We measured mental health and COVID-19 symptoms in ED HCW at a COVID-19 epicenter. A cross-sectional, convenience sample of adult (&#x2265;18 years) ED HCW in Brooklyn, New York, USA, who were employed at &#x2265;50% of a full-time effort, was surveyed September-December, 2020 with reference period March-May 2020. An anonymous email-distributed survey assessed gender, age, race, healthcare worker status (clinical versus non-clinical), SARS-CoV-2 testing, number of people to talk to, COVID-19-related home problems, mental health care interruption during COVID-19, loneliness, and survey date. Outcomes included symptoms of depression, psychological distress, perceived stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and resilience measured using validated scales. Of 774 HCW, 247 (31.9%) responded (mean age 38.2&#xb1;10.8 years; 59.4% White; 52.5% men; 80.1% clinical; 61.6% SARS-CoV-2 tested). Average mental health scores were significantly higher among clinical vs non-clinical HCW (P's&lt;0.0001-0.019). The proportion reporting a clinically-relevant psychological distress symptom burden was higher among clinical vs non-clinical HCW (35.8% vs 13.8%, p=0.019); and suggested for depression (53.9% clinical vs 35.7% non-clinical, p=0.072); perceived stress (63.6% clinical vs 44.8% non-clinical, p=0.053); and PTSD (18.2% clinical vs 3.6% non-clinical, p=0.064). Compared to non-clinical staff, Medical Doctors and Doctors of Osteopathy reported 4.8-fold higher multivariable-adjusted odds of clinically-relevant perceived stress (95%CI 1.8-12.9, p=0.002); Emergency Medical Technicians reported 15.5-fold higher multivariable-adjusted odds of clinically-relevant PTSD (95%CI 1.6-150.4, p=0.018). Increasing age, number of COVID-19-related home problems and people to talk to, loneliness and mental health care interruption were adversely associated with mental health; being male and SARS-CoV-2 testing were beneficial. COVID-19-related mental health burden was high among ED HCW in Brooklyn. Mental health support services are essential for ED HCW.","Gustafson, Yucel, Apple, Cirrone, Gao, Huang, Ma, Saad, Wilson, Kabariti, Motov","https://doi.org/10.18103/mra.v10i7.2903","20221205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41968,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on perinatal mental health among pregnant mothers infected with COVID-19, during the first wave of the epidemic in Jordan","Data concerning the impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection on the mental health of pregnant women are still limited. The study explored baseline information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the perinatal period, among mothers infected with COVID-19, during the first wave of the epidemic in Jordan. The current study aimed to examine the anxiety levels of pregnant women infected with coronavirus over the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period from March to December 2021, using an online survey that addressed key issues related to the role of COVID-19 infection in developing anxiety among pregnant women using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The study population was pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, and who agreed to participate in the study (n=530). The results indicated that one-third of the women had contracted coronavirus infection in each trimester. Most had no pregnancy complications (78.0%), 42.0% had no symptoms of coronavirus infection, 10.0% were hospitalized and 2.0% were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Approximately half declared that they did not receive support from the medical staff, although 71.0% had very good support from their families. Nearly a quarter of respondents stopped smiling while infected, 19% did not want to have any entertainment, and one-third had sleep problems. Moreover, more than half of the pregnant women were feeling anxiety (58.0%) and fear (59.0%). The prevalence of depression and anxiety was 67%. The EPDS scores were statistically significant and associated with being a smoker, method of delivery, getting COVID-19, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and being admitted to a hospital or ICU. This study highlights that healthcare providers and family members should pay more attention to maternal mental health during a pandemic. Fear and anxiety among pregnant women need to be taken into account more during the period of international crises, taking into account the mental health of the pregnant woman when developing health plans, developing health programs, and providing diagnostic and therapeutic management in the maternal care departments.","Hamadneh, Hamadneh, ALBashtawy, Alkhawaldeh, Bashtawi, Alshloul, Rayan, Abdalrahim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12017","20221205","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus infection; depression; pandemic; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41969,""
"""The Internet Is Keeping Me from Dying from Boredom"": Understanding the Management and Social Construction of the Self Through Middle-Class Indian Children's Engagement with Digital Technologies During the COVID-19 Lockdown","This paper unpacks how everyday lives of urban middle-class children were mediated by digital technologies during the COVID-19 national lockdown in India. In contemporary India, children's engagements with digital technologies are structured by their social class, gender, and geographical locations. The resultant disparities between ""media-rich"" and ""media-poor"" childhoods in India are stark (Banaji 2017). In this paper, we argue that the national lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic exposed India's ""media-rich"" children to particular threats and obstacles. Based on semi-structured interviews and mapping exercises with 16- to 17-year-old urban middle-class young people, we explore how being confined to their homes for an extended period when their schools shifted to online delivery of teaching and learning; young people negotiated risks and sought digital opportunities in the management and social construction of the self (Callero 2003, 2014). While the majority of existing studies focus on societal anxieties around children's digital media use, in almost a medicalized and pathological fashion, and its impact on parenting practices (Lim 2020; Livingstone and Blum-Ross 2020), we shift the attention to study this social phenomenon to help understand how children reflect on their engagement with technology and shape their own well-being through social construction of the self. Our findings demonstrate that children are reflexive users of digital technologies, as they navigate network failure issues, the demands of online classrooms, their own mental health and social relationships, and deploy the affordances of digital technologies to combat loneliness, nurture contact with friends, and explore educational and career resources. These strategies, in the management and social construction of the self, play out within the discourse of pedagogized middle-class childhood in India, which is imbued with notions of academic success and failure (Kumar 2016; Sen 2014). Media-rich middle-class young people's management and social construction of the self, in the context of crisis and uncertainty, helps promote our understanding of the relationship between social structure, self-structure, and behavior choices, implications of this for child well-being, and reproduction of social inequality in society.","Sandhu, Barn","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42448-022-00135-8","20221205","COVID-19; Digital; Education; India; Middle-class childhood; Self","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41970,""
"Rural Children's Well-Being in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives from Children in the Midwestern United States","Children in rural areas are more likely to experience a variety of risk factors that increase their vulnerability to physical and mental health disparities. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model (1986) was used as a framework for understanding rural children's perceptions and well-being within multiple interactive contexts during the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenological study was designed to explore rural children's perceptions of their well-being and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their contexts and well-being. This sub-study of the Children's Understandings of Well-Being project followed the standard qualitative interview protocol with additional prompts related to the pandemic. Rural children (age 8 to 18, <i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;72) from the Midwestern United States participated from March 2020 to November 2021 via teleconferencing. Phenomenological analyses of transcripts focused on the essence of children's understanding of well-being and their perception of the impact of the pandemic on their contexts and well-being. Each transcript was coded by author 1 and verified by author 2, and discrepancies were identified, discussed, and resolved. The third author served as an external auditor to enhance trustworthiness. First-cycle coding focused on children's specific references to well-being experiences during COVID-19. Second-cycle selective coding focused on specific well-being experiences and contexts that were impacted by COVID-19. These codes were used to develop two broad themes, ""Well This Kinda Stinks, But We Just Adapt"" and ""Safety Means Something Different to Me Now."" The meaning of themes and subthemes are explored, with implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.","Newland, Mourlam, Strouse","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42448-022-00133-w","20221205","Adapt; COVID-19; Children; Context; Safety; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41971,""
"Major Amputation Needed to Treat Purulent Tenosynovitis and Necrotizing Fasciitis in a Patient with a Human Bite and Severe COVID-19","Peripheral human bite wounds are rarely serious and are typically treated medically, with the most complex cases requiring only minor amputation or excision of the infected site. There are few to no reports documenting the development of purulent tenosynovitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis from these lesions. Major amputations are required only rarely in these cases. A 71-year-old woman presented with an uncontrolled infection following a self-inflicted bite wound to her left middle finger. A bacterial culture of the lesion revealed methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). The infection could not be controlled with antibiotics or additional interventions, including debridement and minor amputation. She contracted severe COVID-19 while in the hospital which limited the available treatment options. In an attempt to control the infection, the patient ultimately underwent a major amputation of the distal left forearm. While recovering from the procedure, the patient succumbed to septic shock and cardiopulmonary arrest. The unusual progression of this case may be attributed to the interventions required to treat acute COVID-19 as well as a variety of confounding factors. For example, vasopressors and steroids used to treat severely-ill patients compromise the local and systemic physiologic responses to acute bacterial infection. It is important to reconsider clinical expectations during the pandemic and intervene as early as possible to prevent ongoing damage and clinical deterioration.","Toga, Balaji, Nagura","https://doi.org/10.2147/IMCRJ.S385264","20221205","COVID-19; amputation; bite wound; gangrene; immunocompromised; necrotizing fasciitis; purulent tenosynovitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41972,""
"Making sense of the crisis: how religion shapes the attribution of meaning during the corona pandemic","In times of existential crisis, such as the Corona pandemic, people may turn to religious traditions that help them make new sense of the depressing situation. While recent studies have shown that during the Corona pandemic, the frequency of prayer and church attendance increased in several countries, we know little about whether and how religious interpretations of the current crisis occur. Building on Crystal Park's Meaning Making Model, the article examines whether individual religiosity, religious affiliation, and the experience of a&#xa0;SARS-CoV&#x2011;2 infection influence religious interpretations of the Corona pandemic. Our results show that religiosity is strongly associated with the idea of a&#xa0;benevolent God and weakly associated with the concept of a&#xa0;punishing God. Members of specific religious groups differed significantly in their religious interpretation of the Corona pandemic. Finally, we found that the experience of a&#xa0;SARS-CoV&#x2011;2 infection was associated with doubts about the power of God.

"Screen time and adolescents' mental health before and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland: A natural experiment","During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, adolescents' mental health was largely undermined. A general increment in screen time was reported. However, the long-term effects of the latter on adolescents' mental health are still little explored. In the present natural experiment, we investigated these effects using longitudinal data collected before and after the first lockdown in Switzerland. Data come from 674 Swiss adolescents (56.7% females, M<sub>age</sub> = 14.45, SD<sub>age</sub> = 0.50) during Spring 2019 (T1) and Autumn 2020 (T2) as part of the longitudinal MEDIATICINO study. Self-reported mental health measures included somatic symptoms, inattention, anxiety, irritability, anger, sleep problems, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, loneliness, and depression. Measures for screen-media activities included time spent on the Internet, smartphones, social media, video gaming, instant messaging, and television viewing. They were all assessed at T1 and T2. Paired-sample <i>t</i>-tests with Bonferroni's correction showed that most mental health problems increased over time with an overall medium effect size (Hedge's <i>g</i> = 0.337). In particular, medium effect sizes were found for anxiety, depression, and inattention; small-to-medium effect sizes were reported for loneliness, sleep problems, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms; and a small effect size was found for somatic symptoms. Screen-media activities increased, with the exception of television viewing and video gaming. The results of the hierarchical regression analyses showed that, controlling for covariates, increased time spent on social media - calculated as the difference between T2 and T1 - was the only screen-media activity significantly associated with worse mental health at T2 (&#x3b2; = 0.112, <i>p</i> = 0.016). More time spent in structured media activities like television viewing diminished levels of inattention (&#x3b2; = -0.091, <i>p</i> = 0.021) and anxiety (&#x3b2; = -0.093, <i>p</i> = 0.014). Among covariates, being female, experiencing two or more life events, having mental health problems at T1, and using screens for homeschooling negatively influenced mental health at T2. These results align with literature indicating a small but negative effect of social media time on mental health. Underlying mechanisms are manifold, including increased exposure to COVID-19 news, heightened fear of missing out, social comparison, and time-displaced for activities such as physical activity and green time. However, in line with the <i>structured days hypothesis</i>, getting involved in media-structured activities like television viewing might protect against mental health symptoms.","Marciano, Viswanath, Morese, Camerini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.981881","20221205","COVID-19; adolescents; lockdown; longitudinal; mental health; natural experiment; screen time; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41974,""
"Mindfulness-based online intervention on mental health among undergraduate nursing students during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Beijing, China: A randomized controlled trial","To evaluate the effect of mindfulness intervention on improving mental health among undergraduate nursing students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China. An online mindfulness intervention course named Mindfulness Living With Challenge (MLWC) was developed by the research team, and a randomized controlled trial using MLWC among Chinese undergraduate nursing students was carried out. A total of 120 undergraduate nursing students were randomized into control (60 students) and intervention groups (60 students) <i>via</i> a WeChat mini program. Self-administered questionnaire surveys were conducted at pre- and post-intervention, measuring depression, anxiety, stress, mindfulness, and perceived social support. After intervention, the acceptance of the online mindfulness course among participants was assessed by employing the theory of technology acceptance model (TAM). Among the enrolled 120 participants, 86.67% (52/60) and 93.33% (56/60) of the intervention and control groups remained completed the trial and the questionnaire surveys.

"Isolated and Stressed? Examining the Effects of Management Communication in Alleviating Mental Health Symptoms during COVID-19","The goal of this research was to assess the role of professional isolation on mental health symptoms via stress among employees working remotely due to COVID-19. Additionally, this research explored the interactive effect of management communication on the relationship between professional isolation and stress, and stress and mental health symptoms. In Study 1, behavior analysts who were working remotely as a result of the pandemic completed assessments of professional isolation, stress, and mental health symptoms at two points in time, separated by two weeks. Study 2 replicated and extended the findings from Study 1 in a sample of remote employees recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk using a three-wave design. Findings of both Study 1 and Study 2 suggested that stress mediated the relationship between professional isolation and mental health symptoms. Additionally, management communication buffered the association between stress and mental health symptoms in Study 2. Lastly, the indirect effect of professional isolation on mental health symptoms was stronger for those who received less communication from their management. The findings of these two studies expand our understanding of the mechanism and boundary condition through which professional isolation is related to mental health symptoms.","Sawhney, Jimenez-Gomez, Cook, Albert","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41542-022-00133-9","20221205","COVID-19; Management communication; Mental health symptoms; Professional isolation; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41976,""
"On the development of an information system for monitoring user opinion and its role for the public","Social media services and analytics platforms are rapidly growing. A large number of various events happen mostly every day, and the role of social media monitoring tools is also increasing. Social networks are widely used for managing and promoting brands and different services. Thus, most popular social analytics platforms aim for business purposes while monitoring various social, economic, and political problems remains underrepresented and not covered by thorough research. Moreover, most of them focus on resource-rich languages such as the English language, whereas texts and comments in other low-resource languages, such as the Russian and Kazakh languages in social media, are not represented well enough. So, this work is devoted to developing and applying the information system called the OMSystem for analyzing users' opinions on news portals, blogs, and social networks in Kazakhstan. The system uses sentiment dictionaries of the Russian and Kazakh languages and machine learning algorithms to determine the sentiment of social media texts. The whole structure and functionalities of the system are also presented. The experimental part is devoted to building machine learning models for sentiment analysis on the Russian and Kazakh datasets. Then the performance of the models is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The models with the highest scores are selected for implementation in the OMSystem. Then the OMSystem's social analytics module is used to thoroughly analyze the healthcare, political and social aspects of the most relevant topics connected with the vaccination against the coronavirus disease. The analysis allowed us to discover the public social mood in the cities of Almaty and Nur-Sultan and other large regional cities of Kazakhstan. The system's study included two extensive periods: 10-01-2021 to 30-05-2021 and 01-07-2021 to 12-08-2021. In the obtained results, people's moods and attitudes to the Government's policies and actions were studied by such social network indicators as the level of topic discussion activity in society, the level of interest in the topic in society, and the mood level of society. These indicators calculated by the OMSystem allowed careful identification of alarming factors of the public (negative attitude to the government regulations, vaccination policies, trust in vaccination, etc.) and assessment of the social mood.","Karyukin, Mutanov, Mamykova, Nassimova, Torekul, Sundetova, Negri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-022-00660-w","20221205","Analytics platforms; Coronavirus disease; Machine learning; OMSystem; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment dictionary; Social media; Social mood; Social networks; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41977,""
"Care-home Nurses' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: Managing ethical conundrums at personal cost: A qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented effect on those living and working in care-homes for older people, as residents were particularly vulnerable to contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, associated with high morbidity and mortality. Often undervalued, care-home nurses (RNs) are leaders, managing complex care while working in isolation from their professional peers. The pandemic made this more apparent, when care and treatments for COVID-19 were initially unknown, isolation increased due to withdrawal of many professional health services, accompanied by staff shortages. To explore RNs' experiences of working in older people's care-homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative interview study. Care-homes for older people in England and Scotland, UK. Recruitment via direct contact with care-homes, social media, and links provided by national partners, then purposive sampling for age, gender, type of care-home, and location. Data collected through one-to-one online interviews using topic guide developed collaboratively with care-home nurses, focusing on how COVID-19 impacted on nurses' resilience and mental wellbeing. Data analyzed thematically using Tronto's ethics of care framework to guide development of interpretative themes. Eighteen nurses (16 female; 16 adult, and two mental health nurses) were interviewed March-June 2021; majority aged 46-55&#x2009;years; mean time registered with Nursing and Midwifery Council: 19&#x2009;years; 17 had nursed residents with COVID-19. RNs' experiences resonated with Tronto's five tenets of ethical care: attentiveness, responsibility, competence, responsiveness, and solidarity. All nurses described being attentive to needs of others, but were less attentive to their own needs, which came at personal cost. RNs were aware of their professional and leadership responsibilities, being as responsive as they could be to resident needs, processing and sharing rapidly changing guidance and implementing appropriate infection control measures, but felt that relatives and regulatory bodies were not always appreciative. RNs developed enhanced clinical skills, increasing their professional standing, but reported having to compromise care, leading to moral distress. Broadly, participants reported a sense of solidarity across care-home staff and working together to cope with the crisis. Care-home nurses felt unprepared for managing the COVID-19 pandemic, many experienced moral distress. Supporting care-home nurses to recover from the pandemic is essential to maintain a healthy, stable workforce and needs to be specific to care-home RNs, recognizing their unique pandemic experiences. Support for RNs will likely benefit other care-home workers either directly through wider roll-out, or indirectly through improved wellbeing of nurse leaders. The COVID-19 pandemic, an international public health emergency, created many challenges for Registered Nurses (RNs) working in long-term care facilities for older people, as residents were particularly vulnerable to the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Care-home RNs faced challenges distinct from their hospital-based nursing peers and non-nursing social care colleagues due to their isolation, leadership roles, professional legal obligations, and ethical responsibilities, leading to psychological distress on the one hand, but also a newly found confidence in their existing and newly developed skills, and increased recognition by the wider health community of their specialisms.","Birt, Lane, Corner, Sanderson, Bunn","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12855","20221205","COVID-19; Nurse's role; aged; ethics; homes for the aged; nursing; nursing care; post-traumatic; psychological; stress-disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41978,""
"Workplace Violence and the Mental Health of Public Health Workers During COVID-19","During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health workers were at an increased risk for violence and harassment due to their public health work and experienced adverse mental health conditions. This article quantifies the prevalence of job-related threats, harassment, and discrimination against public health workers and measures the association of these incidents with mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nonprobability convenience sample of state, local, and tribal public health workers completed a self-administered, online survey in April 2021. The survey link was emailed to members of national public health associations and included questions on workplace violence, demographics, workplace factors, and mental health symptoms. Mental health symptoms were measured using standardized, validated tools to assess depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation. Multivariable Poisson models calculated adjusted prevalence ratios of mental health symptoms, with workplace violence as the primary risk factor. Analyses were conducted in 2021-2022. Experiencing any type or combination of workplace violence was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of reporting depression symptoms (prevalence ratio=1.21, 95% CI=1.15, 1.27), anxiety (prevalence ratio=1.21, 95% CI=1.15, 1.27), post-traumatic stress disorder (prevalence ratio=1.31, 95% CI=1.25, 1.37), and suicidal ideation (prevalence ratio=1.26, 95% CI=1.14, 1.38), after adjusting for confounders. A dose&#x2012;response relationship was found between the number of workplace violence events experienced by a public health worker and the likelihood of reporting mental health symptoms. Violence targeted at the public health workforce is detrimental to workers and their communities. Ongoing training, workplace support, and increased communication after a workplace violence incident may be helpful. Efforts to strengthen public health capacities and support the public health workforce are also needed.","Tiesman, Hendricks, Wiegand, Lopes-Cardozo, Rao, Horter, Rose, Byrkit","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2022.10.004","20221204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41979,""
"Sustainable financing for Immunization Agenda 2030","Sustainable financing for immunization refers to the sufficient and predictable allocation and use of resources to support the achievement of immunization goals within the framework of overall health financing. The Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) agenda spells out four important focus areas needed for sustainable financing: (1) ensuring sufficient and predictable resources, (2) making optimal use of resources, (3) aligning partnerships, and (4) supporting sustainable transitions from external assistance. This paper summarizes the evidence and proposes interventions under each area. While immunization is one of the best investments and justifies public financing, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the worst economic recession since the Great Depression and threatens countries' ability to mobilize funding to ensure continuity and access to essential services, including immunization. Strategies for ensuring adequate resources differ by income group but include raising more revenues, reprioritizing the budget towards health, and ensuring that health resources favor Primary Health Care (PHC) and immunization. In low- and lower-middle income countries, support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which channels the largest amount of external financing, will remain important, but some lower-middle income countries will need to prepare for transition. Countries benefitting from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are also experiencing a transition from GPEI financing to domestic and other external financing. This paper outlines ways in which countries can improve the use of domestic and external resources to better incentivize high-quality PHC and immunization services and align immunization programs with health sector reforms. While governments must lead, collective action from development partners, the private sector, and civil society is needed to promote health system financing systems that ensure that the world is better prepared for future outbreaks and pandemics, while reinforcing the IA2030 vision and making progress towards universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.","Saxenian, Alkenbrack, Freitas Attaran, Barcarolo, Brenzel, Brooks, Ekeman, Griffiths, Rozario, Vande Maele, Ranson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.037","20221204","Efficiency; Equity; Financing; Immunization; Public financial management; Universal health coverage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41980,""
"Using research-practice-policy partnerships to mitigate the effects of childhood trauma on educator burnout","The effects of COVID-19 pandemic on children have been immense. In this commentary, we argue for the need to utilize research-practice-policy partnerships to address the issue of educator burnout and Secondary Traumatic Stress. Education systems have the potential to be the site of public health interventions in helping to identify and address the needs of children and families. In this commentary, we review the literature on child trauma and adversity, educator burnout, and research-practice-policy partnerships. With the return to in-person learning, educators, and the systems in which they work are overwhelmed by the magnitude of mental health challenges presenting in the classroom due to child trauma. As a result, many educators are reporting high levels of compassion fatigue, secondary trauma, and burnout, which are known predictors of leaving the workforce. Many of the strategies employed to address educator compassion fatigue, secondary trauma, and burnout focus directly on the individual level (e.g., deep breathing, yoga). Yet the compassion fatigue, secondary trauma, and burnout are rooted in larger system failures to address the growing needs of children and families. By bringing together key community members, including educators, and utilizing local data to inform policy decisions, actionable, trauma-informed solutions can create the conditions for thriving educators and therefore, thriving children.","Tirrell-Corbin, Klika, Schelbe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105941","20221204","Burnout; Child abuse; Research-practice-policy partnership; Secondary trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41981,""
"Cognitive Complaints Assessment and Neuropsychiatric Disorders After Mild COVID-19 Infection","This study aimed to analyze cognitive impairment associated with long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome and its correlation with anxiety, depression, and fatigue in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. This was a cross-sectional study of 127 patients with COVID-19. Tests to screen for neuropsychiatric symptoms included the Fatigue Severity Scale, Mini-Mental State Exam 2 (MMSE-2), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In cognitive tests, SDMT was abnormal in 22%, being more sensitive than MMSE-2 to detect cognitive changes. Furthermore, although manifestations such as fatigue, depression, and anxiety were frequent in the post-COVID-19 phase, these 3 conditions, known to contribute to cognitive impairment, were slightly correlated with worse performance on the rapid screening tests. In patients with mild COVID-19 and cognitive complaints, SDMT helped to confirm disturbances in the attention domain and processing speed.","Hammerle, Sales, Pinheiro, Gouvea, de Almeida, de Araujo Davico, Souza, Spedo, Nicaretta, Alvarenga, Pires, Thuler, Vasconcelos","https://doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acac093","20221204","COVID-19; Neurocognitive deficits; Neurocognitive screenings; Post-COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41982,""
"Psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women with trauma histories: Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)","Older adults, particularly those with trauma histories, may be vulnerable to adverse psychosocial outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We tested associations between prepandemic childhood abuse or intimate partner violence (IPV) and elevated depressive, anxiety, conflict, and sleep symptoms during the pandemic among aging women. Women (N = 582, age: 65-77 years) from three U.S. sites (Pittsburgh, Boston, Newark) of the longitudinal Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) reported pandemic-related psychosocial impacts from June 2020-March 2021. Prepandemic childhood abuse; physical/emotional IPV; social functioning; physical comorbidities; and depressive, anxiety, and sleep symptoms were drawn from SWAN assessments between 2009 and 2017. There were no measures of prepandemic conflict. In total, 47.7% and 35.3% of women, respectively, reported childhood abuse or IPV. Using logistic regression models adjusted for age; race/ethnicity; education; site; prepandemic social functioning and physical comorbidities; and, in respective models, prepandemic depressive, anxiety, or sleep symptoms, childhood abuse predicted elevated anxiety symptoms, OR = 1.67, 95% CI [1.10, 2.54]; household conflict, OR = 2.19, 95% CI [1.32, 3.61]; and nonhousehold family conflict, OR = 2.14, 95% CI [1.29, 3.55]. IPV predicted elevated sleep problems, OR = 1.63, 95% CI [1.07, 2.46], and household conflict, OR = 1.96, 95% CI [1.20, 3.21]. No associations emerged for depressive symptoms after adjusting for prepandemic depression.

"Psychiatric symptoms and emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian adolescents during the third lockdown: a cross-sectional cohort study","A previous study showed that about 80% of Italian adolescents reported isolated symptoms of acute or post-traumatic stress during the first lockdown in Italy. We proposed a new questionnaire to investigate the presence of symptoms related to anxiety, panic, depression, eating disorders, sleep disorders, social withdrawal, stress disorders, psychotic symptoms, anti-conservative thoughts, and self-harming acts aggravated by COVID-19 restrictions and possible differences between males and females. 500 adolescents (12-18&#xa0;years) completed an online survey created using validated scales. 41% of the respondents felt more stress than during the first lockdown. 1.85% showed suprathreshold symptoms for post-traumatic stress disorder and 21% showed isolated symptoms of acute or post-traumatic stress due to the pandemic. In addition, we found psychotic symptoms (16%), panic (25% suprathreshold), anxiety (46.8% suprathreshold), depression (18.7% suprathreshold), eating-related symptoms (51%), sleep difficulties (57%), a tendency to social withdrawal after the pandemic (15%), suicidal ideation (30%), and self-harming behavior (9%). Furthermore, girls showed a more severe level of distress. The results show a high prevalence of symptoms because of the COVID-19 pandemic and confirm the need for easy access to support and treatment service to help contain the bio-psycho-social risk factors prompted by the current pandemic and promptly and effectively manage the consequences.","Mensi, Iacopelli, Orlandi, Capone, Rogantini, Vecchio, Casini, Borgatti","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-25358-0","20221203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41984,""
"Survival outcomes following treatment delays among patients with early-stage female cancers: a nationwide study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely hindered the timely receipt of health care for patients with cancer, especially female patients. Depression and anxiety were more pronounced in female patients than their male counterparts with cancer during treatment wait-time intervals. Herein, investigating the impact of treatment delays on the survival outcomes of female patients with early-stage cancers can enhance the rational and precise clinical decisions of physicians. We analyzed five types of cancers in women from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between Jan 2010 and Dec 2015. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the impacts of treatment delays on the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of the patients. A total of 241,661 females with early-stage cancer were analyzed (12,617 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 166,051 cases of infiltrating breast cancer, 31,096 cases of differentiated thyroid cancer, 23,550 cases of colorectal cancer, and 8347 cases of cervical cancer). Worse OS rates were observed in patients with treatment delays &#x2265;&#x2009;3&#xa0;months in stage I NSCLC (<sub>adjusted</sub>Hazard ratio (HR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.11, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01-1.23, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044) and stage I infiltrating breast cancer (<sub>adjusted</sub>HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.23, 95% CI 1.11-1.37, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). When the treatment delay intervals were analyzed as continuous variables, similar results were observed in patients with stage I NSCLC (<sub>adjusted</sub>HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010) and in those with stage I breast cancer (<sub>adjusted</sub>HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029). However, treatment delays did not reduce the OS of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, cervical cancer, or colorectal cancer in the early-stage. Only intermediate treatment delays impaired the CSS of patients with cervical cancer in stage I (<sub>adjusted</sub>HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.31, 95% CI 1.02-1.68, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032). After adjusting for confounders, the prolonged time from diagnosis to the initiation of treatment (&lt;&#x2009;6&#xa0;months) showed limited negative effects on the survival of most of the patients with early-stage female cancers.

"Role of the arts in the life and mental health of young people that participate in artistic organizations in Colombia: a qualitative study","Adolescents and young adults are vulnerable to developing mental distress. However, evidence suggests that more than half of the young people with symptoms of depression and anxiety overcome their distress within a year. However, there is little research on the exact resources that young people use and help them to recover. The aim of this study was to explore how arts activities can support the recovery of young people engaged with arts organizations in Bogota. We recruited 38 participants from two arts organizations in Bogot&#xe1; and conducted six focus groups embedded within artistic workshops. The type of activities in the workshops varied reflecting the different teaching methods of the two organizations. The focus group discussions were recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Five themes explained how arts activities can help young people participating in artistic organizations to overcome mental distress: i) allowing the expression of emotions; ii) helping to manage and transform emotions; iii) distracting from problems; iv) facilitating social support and relationships; and v) contributing to the identity of young people. For young people who participate in artistic organizations, the arts are a resource for overcoming negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and sadness. The beneficial role of arts activities includes different process of managing, expressing, and distracting from distress, and it differs depending on whether arts are perceived as a professional vocation or a hobby.","G&#xf3;mez-Restrepo, Casasbuenas, Ortiz-Hern&#xe1;ndez, Bird, Acosta, Restrepo, Sarmiento, Steffen, Priebe","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04396-y","20221203","Adolescence; Anxiety; Art; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41986,""
"Mental health assessment of healthcare workers in the emergency department of a low middle-income country during COVID-19 pandemic","Emergency department (ED) healthcare workers in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic are facing an acute rise in mental illnesses. In this study, the authors aim to assess the frequency of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers in the ED. A cross-sectional online google form-based survey was conducted in the ED of Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan between July and August 2020. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale was used for mental illness assessment among ED healthcare workers. Descriptive analysis of grading as per the Likert scale is done through frequencies, means, and standard deviations. Categorical variables were expressed as frequency (%). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare scores of various groups and sub-groups and the Chi-square test was used to assess the association of depression and anxiety categories among the groups. In the ED, 127 healthcare workers (physicians and nurses) were included in this survey. The median depression score was 8 (IQR 6-10) with 21% (27) falling under depression and 39% (50) under borderline depression. The median anxiety score was 9 (IQR 7-12) with 33% (42) having abnormal, and 38% (48) having borderline anxiety.&#xa0;Healthcare workers working for&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;45&#xa0;h per week have odds of 3.62 [1.374-9.549] of developing depression compared to anxiety with a p-value of 0.009.

ED healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic suffered high levels of anxiety and depression, which is a matter of concern.

"Mental health symptom changes in pregnant individuals across the COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective longitudinal study","Initial studies found that mental health symptoms increased in pregnant and postpartum individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Less research has focused on if these putative increases persist over time and what factors influence these changes. We examined the longitudinal change in mental health symptoms in pregnant and postpartum individuals and investigated moderation by maternal emotion dysregulation and the incidence of coronavirus. Pregnant and postpartum individuals at the University of Utah were invited to join the COVID-19 and Perinatal Experiences (COPE) Study. Beginning on April 23, 2020 participants were sent a survey comprised of demographics, medical and social history, pregnancy information and self-assessments (Time 1). Participants were contacted 90 days later and invited to participate in a follow-up questionnaire (Time 2). Daily coronavirus case counts were accessed from the state of Utah and a 7-day moving average calculated. Within-subject change in mental health symptom scores, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory, was calculated. Linear mixed effects regression modeling adjusted for history of substance abuse and mental health disorders. 270 individuals responded between April 23rd, 2020 and July 15th, 2021. Mental health symptom scores improved by 1.36 points (0.7-2.0 p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The decrease in mental health symptoms was not moderated by the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.19) but was moderated by emotion dysregulation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) as defined by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale short form. Participants with higher emotion dysregulation also had higher mental health symptom scores. Mental health symptoms improved over the course of the pandemic in the same pregnant or postpartum participant. Our findings do not negate the importance of mental health care during the pandemic. Rather, we believe this identifies some aspect of resiliency and adaptability. Examining emotion dysregulation, or asking about a history of mental health, may be helpful in identifying persons at higher risk of heightened responses to stressors.","Gimbel, Allshouse, Neff, Silver, Conradt, Crowell","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-05144-6","20221203","(10 maximum): pregnancy; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Emotion dysregulation; Maternal mental health; Mental health symptoms; Pandemic; Perinatal mental health; Postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41988,""
"Predicting depression and anxiety of Chinese population during COVID-19 in psychological evaluation data by XGBoost","Due to the onset of sudden stress, COVID-19 has greatly impacted the incidence of depression and anxiety. However, challenges still exist in identifying high-risk groups for depression and anxiety during COVID-19. Studies have identified how resilience and social support can be employed as effective predictors of depression and anxiety. This study aims to select the best combination of variables from measures of resilience, social support, and alexithymia for predicting depression and anxiety. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost<sup>1</sup>) model was applied to a dataset including data on 29,841 participants that was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Discriminant analyses on groups of participants with depression (DE<sup>2</sup>), anxiety (AN<sup>3</sup>), comorbid depression and anxiety (DA<sup>4</sup>), and healthy controls (HC<sup>5</sup>), were performed. All variables were selected according to their importance for classification. Further, analyses were performed with selected features to determine the best variable combination. The mean accuracies achieved by three classification tasks, DE vs HC, AN vs HC, and DA vs HC, were 0.78, 0.77, and 0.89. Further, the combination of 19 selected features almost exhibited the same performance as all 56 variables (accuracies&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.75, 0.75, and 0.86). Resilience, social support, and some demographic data can accurately distinguish DE, AN, and DA from HC. The results can be used to inform screening practices for depression and anxiety. Additionally, the model performance of a limited scale including only 19 features indicates that using a simplified scale is feasible.","Tian, Qu, Zhao, Zhu, Wang, Tan, Jiang, Tan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.11.044","20221203","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Machine learning; Resilience; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41989,""

We extracted the citation, publication date, design, aim, country of origin, participant characteristics, sampling method, method of measurement of race and ethnicity, and mental health outcome(s). The combined racial and ethnic representation of the 16,841 participants in the included studies was White (76.5%), Black (9.8%), other/multiracial (6.2%), Asian (3.9%), Hispanic/Latina (2.6%), Indigenous or Ethnic Minority Canadian (0.9%), and Native American or Alaska Native (0.1%). Most studies were conducted in the United States, used a cross-sectional design, and incorporated social media platforms to recruit participants. Depression, anxiety, and stress were the most frequently assessed mental health outcomes. Relatively few women of color who were pregnant or in the postpartum period during the pandemic participated in mental health research studies. Future studies should develop intentional recruitment strategies to increase participation of women of color. Researchers should use updated guidance on reporting race and ethnicity to accurately represent every participant, minimize misclassification of women of color, and report meaningful results.","Goyal, Dol, Leckey, Naraine, Dennis, Chan, Basu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogn.2022.11.003","20221203","COVID-19; mental health; mothers; postpartum period; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41990,""

"The bi-directional association between loneliness and depression among older adults from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic","Older adults have both the highest risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and in many jurisdictions have had additional restrictions placed on the social interactions. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased depression and loneliness among older adults. Using data from an established cohort of older adults, the aims of this study was to describe changes in loneliness and depression and to examine the directionality of the association between depression and loneliness over a 5-year period that included the early months of the pandemic. Data were from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a large cohort of community-dwelling adults aged 54+. We applied an auto-regressive cross-lagged panel modelling approach to estimate the effect of depression on loneliness and vice versa over three time points. Both depression and loneliness increased significantly in the early months of the pandemic. While the association between loneliness and depression was bi-directional, loneliness was a stronger predictor of depression. The strength and bi-directionality of the association between loneliness and depression suggests that interventions to alleviate loneliness may also help reduce depressive symptoms and vice versa.","Ward, Briggs, McGarrigle, De Looze, O'Halloran, Kenny","https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5856","20221203","COVID-19; ageing; depression; loneliness; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41994,""
"Impacts of the 2019/20 bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of older Australians: a cross-sectional survey","In 2019/20 major bushfires devastated Australia's East Coast. Shortly afterward the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. Older people are disproportionately affected by disasters and are at high risk from respiratory pandemics. However, little is known about how these events impact on older peoples' health and well-being and engagement with services such as primary care. To explore the health impacts of the 2019/20 bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic on older Australians' health and well-being. One hundred and fifty-five people aged over 65 years living in South-eastern New South Wales, Australia participated in an online survey. The survey measured the impacts of the bushfires and COVID-19 on physical and mental health and the capacity of older people to manage these impacts. Most respondents felt that the bushfires caused them to feel anxious/worried (86.2%) and negatively affected their physical (59.9%) and mental (57.2%) health. While many participants had similar feelings about COVID-19, significantly fewer felt these physical and mental health impacts than from the bushfires. A significantly greater perceived level of impact was observed for females and those with health problems. More respondents described negative mental health than physical health effects. Those who felt more impacted by the events had lower levels of resilience, social connection and support, and self-rated health. The health impacts identified in this study represent an opportunity for primary care to intervene to both ensure that people with support needs are identified and provided timely support and that older people are prepared for future disasters.","Halcomb, Thompson, Morris, James, Dilworth, Haynes, Batterham","https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmac138","20221203","Australia; COVID-19; aged; primary care; surveys and questionnaires; wildfires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41995,""
"Mental health status of healthcare providers during the Covid-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study across India","Background From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, studies have observed an increased prevalence of psychological symptoms in the general population and healthcare providers. We studied the prevalence of psychological symptoms among the latter. Methods We did this study using a self-administered questionnaire among healthcare providers across India who were involved in caring/treating patients. The questionnaire collected information on demographics, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and semi-structured questions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Results A total of 612 healthcare providers participated in the study; 254 were doctors of various specialties and 358 were nursing care-providers. According to the DASS-21 assessment, the prevalence of depression was 12.4%, anxiety was 19.1% and stress was 10.8%. The prevalence of psychological problems was more among nursing staff compared to doctors (depression risk ratio [RR] 2.4, anxiety RR 1.73 and stress RR 2.93) and they were equal among both genders (depression RR 1.05, anxiety RR 1.06 and stress RR 1.21). Conclusions Our study shows that there is a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among healthcare providers, particularly among nursing care-providers. We suggest psychological interventions to nursing care-providers and also those who are vulnerable among doctors, to improve their mental health status.","Ramdurg, Mudanur, Bentoor, Mudanur","https://doi.org/10.25259/NMJI-35-3-153","20221203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41996,""
"Depression, anxiety, stress and resilience among undergraduate health sciences students of a rural tertiary healthcare centre in Maharashtra during the Covid-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional, online survey","Background The Covid-19 pandemic caused a rapidly evolving and confused situation. Health sciences students (HSSs) are not immune to depression, anxiety and stress during such a pandemic. We aimed to assess the relation between depression, anxiety, stress and resilience among undergraduate HSSs during the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey at a rural tertiary healthcare centre in Maharashtra. Data were recorded from study participants on sociodemographic details using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Data were analysed using SPSS software version 15.0. Results A total of 381 students participated in the online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress were 7.6%, 6.3% and 1.0%, respectively. There was a positive correlation between all three sub-scales of DASS-21. On BRS, 5 (1.3%) participants had high resilience, 216 (56.7%) had normal resilience and 160 (42.0%) had low resilience. Those respondents who had high resilience had lower rates of depression, anxiety and stress on DASS-21 sub-scales. Conclusion A proportion of HSSs had anxiety, depression and stress during the Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown. Respondents with high resilience had less frequent depression, anxiety and stress. In the long run, strengthening resilience of HSSs may be useful.","Ghogare, Patil, Spoorthy, Aloney, Bele, Ambad","https://doi.org/10.25259/NMJI-35-3-147","20221203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41997,""
"Hand sanitizer-related calls at the National Poisons Information Centre, India during the lockdown period of the Covid-19 pandemic","Background Hand sanitizer (HS) has been increasingly used during the Covid-19 pandemic. We compared the telephonic calls received by the National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC), New Delhi, India, related to its unsafe exposure and inappropriate use during the lockdown and prelockdown periods. Methods We analysed and compared telephonic call records of 3 months of pre-lockdown and 3 months of the lockdown and HS-related calls in different age groups and zones during these periods. Results The centre received 4000 calls; of these 1583 (40%) were related to household products of which only 63 (4%) were related to HS. There was an 8-fold increase in the number of calls received at the NPIC during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period seeking medical attention following unsafe exposure or inappropriate use of HS. More calls were received from the south and north zones and, in the majority of these cases, HS was ingested accidentally. In some cases, HS was ingested intentionally for suicide during the lockdown. Conclusions Our study shows that unsafe exposure of HS is common under conditions of stress as seen during the lockdown period of the Covid-19 pandemic. It should be kept out of reach of small children. Further, providing psychological help and counselling to older age groups under conditions of stress are important issues of concern.","Sharma, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.25259/NMJI-35-3-159","20221203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41998,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health workforce: A rapid review","The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant adaptations to healthcare. Provision of mental healthcare in a changing environment presented healthcare workers with unique challenges and demands, including changes in workload and expectations. To inform current and future healthcare service responses, and adaptations, the current review aimed to collate and examine the impact of the pandemic on mental healthcare workers (MHWs). We conducted a rapid systematic review to examine the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on MHWs. Searches were conducted in Ovid Medline and PsycInfo and restricted to articles published from 2020. Inclusion criteria specified articles written in English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and that examined any outcome of the impact of COVID-19 on MHWs; 55 articles fulfilled these criteria. Outcomes were categorized into 'work-related outcomes' and 'personal outcomes'. Mental healthcare workers worldwide experienced a range of work-related and personal adversities during the pandemic. Key work-related outcomes included increased workload, changed roles, burnout, decreased job satisfaction, telehealth challenges, difficulties with work-life balance, altered job performance, vicarious trauma and increased workplace violence. Personal outcomes included decreased well-being, increased psychological distress and psychosocial difficulties. These outcomes differed between inpatient, outpatient and remote settings. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the delivery of mental healthcare and MHWs experienced both work-related and personal adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the continuation of changes introduced to healthcare in the initial stages of the pandemic, it will be important to maintain efforts to monitor negative outcomes and ensure supports for MHWs, going forward.","Crocker, Gnatt, Haywood, Butterfield, Bhat, Lalitha, Jenkins, Castle","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13097","20221203","COVID-19; mental health; mental health personnel; mental health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",41999,""
"Probable COVID-19 infection is associated with subsequent poorer mental health and greater loneliness in the UK COVID-19 Mental Health and Wellbeing study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with psychological distress. In addition to physical effects including fatigue and cognitive impairment, contracting COVID-19 itself may also be related to subsequent negative mental health outcomes. The present study reports data from a longitudinal, national survey of the UK adult population investigating whether contracting suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at the early stages of the pandemic (March-May 2020) was associated with poorer mental health outcomes in May/June 2020, October/November 2020 and June/July 2021. A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3077) were utilised. Experience of contracting COVID-19 during the first UK lockdown was assessed along with levels of depression, anxiety, mental wellbeing and loneliness. Around 9% of participants reported contracting COVID-19 in March/May 2020 (waves 1-3) with just under 13% of the overall sample reporting COVID-19 at any one of the first three time points. Compared to those without probable COVID-19 infection, participants with probable COVID-19 had poorer mental health outcomes at follow-up with these effects lasting up to 13&#xa0;months (e.g., May/June 2020:OR<sub>depression</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.70, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; OR<sub>anxiety</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.61, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002; Oct/Nov 2020, OR<sub>depression</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.82, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; OR<sub>anxiety</sub> 1.56, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013; June/July 2021, OR<sub>depression</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.01, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; OR<sub>anxiety</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.67, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008).

The current study demonstrates that contracting probable COVID-19 at the early stage of the pandemic was related to long-lasting associations with mental health and the relationship between mental health status and probable COVID-19 is bidirectional.","Wilding, O'Connor, Ferguson, Cleare, Wetherall, O'Carroll, Robb, O'Connor","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-24240-3","20221202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42000,""
"Mathematical modeling to study the impact of immigration on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study for Venezuela","We propose two different mathematical models to study the effect of immigration on the COVID-19 pandemic. The first model does not consider immigration, whereas the second one does. Both mathematical models consider five different subpopulations: susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptomatic carriers, and recovered. We find the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> using the next-generation matrix method for the mathematical model without immigration. This threshold parameter is paramount because it allows us to characterize the evolution of the disease and identify what parameters substantially affect the COVID-19 pandemic outcome. We focus on the Venezuelan scenario, where immigration and emigration have been important over recent years, particularly during the pandemic. We show that the estimation of the transmission rates of the SARS-CoV-2 are affected when the immigration of infected people is considered. This has an important consequence from a public health perspective because if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, we can expect that the SARS-CoV-2 would disappear. Thus, if the basic reproduction number is slightly above one, we can predict that some mild non-pharmaceutical interventions would be enough to decrease the number of infected people. The results show that the dynamics of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the population must consider immigration to obtain better insight into the outcomes and create awareness in the population regarding the population flow.","Gonz&#xe1;lez-Parra, D&#xed;az-Rodr&#xed;guez, Arenas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2022.100532","20221202","Basic reproduction number; Epidemiology; Immigration; Mathematical modeling; SARS-CoV-2 virus; Venezuela","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42001,""

"Pregnancy-related COVID worry, depressive symptom severity, and mediation through sleep disturbance in a low-income, primarily Latinx population in California's Central valley","This study (1) assessed the psychometric properties of a pregnancy-related COVID worry scale, (2) explored variations in pregnancy-related COVID worry over the course of the pandemic, and (3) examined associations between pregnancy-related COVID worry and depressive symptom severity, and evaluated sleep disturbance as a mediator. Data were drawn from an ongoing randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of two enhanced forms of prenatal care. The current analysis includes baseline pre-randomization data collected from participants who enrolled November 2020-November 2021 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;201). Participants were pregnant individuals with low income and primarily Latinx. Our 7-item scale was valid and reliable for assessing pregnancy-related COVID worry. Pregnancy-related COVID worry did not vary significantly by any participant characteristic or pandemic stage. Pregnancy-related COVID worry was significantly associated with depressive symptom severity in multivariate analysis (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.002). For each unit increase on the 10-point pregnancy-related COVID worry scale, the odds of mild-to-severe depression increased by 16% (odds ratio&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.32, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.02), holding all other variables constant. Sleep disturbance mediated the pregnancy-related COVID worry-depressive symptom relationship (48% of the total effect mediated). Worry about how COVID may impact their baby, birth, and postpartum experiences was associated with higher depressive symptom severity, partly through its effect on sleep. These findings suggest that interventions related to improving sleep quality among perinatal populations may reduce depressive symptoms.

"Using Twitter Data to Estimate Prevalence of Mental Disorder Symptoms in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Ecological Cohort Study","Existing research and national surveillance data suggested an increase of the prevalence of mental disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Social media, such as Twitter, could be a source of data for estimation due to its real-time nature, high availability, and large geographical coverage. However, there is a dearth of studies validating the accuracy of Twitter-based prevalence for mental disorders through the comparison with CDC-reported prevalence. This study aims to verify the feasibility of Twitter-based prevalence for mental disorders symptoms being an instrument for prevalence estimation, where the feasibility is gauged via the correlations between Twitter-based prevalence of mental disorder symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) and the one based on national surveillance data. In addition, this study aims to identify how the correlations changed over time (i.e., the temporal trend). State-level prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were retrieved from the National Household Pulse Survey (HPS) through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from April 2020 to July 2021. Tweets were retrieved from the Twitter streaming API during the same period and used to estimate the prevalence of mental disorder symptoms for each state using keyword analysis. Stratified linear mixed models were employed to evaluate the correlations between the Twitter-based prevalence of mental disorder symptoms and those reported by the CDC. The magnitude and significance of model parameters were used to evaluate the correlations. Temporal trends of correlations were tested after adding the time variable to the model. Geospatial differences were compared based on random effects. The Pearson correlations between the overall prevalence based on CDC and Twitter for anxiety and depressive symptoms were 0.587 (P&lt;.001) and 0.368 (P&lt;.001), respectively. Stratified by four phases (i.e., April 2020, August 2020, October 2020, and April 2021) defined by HPS, linear mixed models showed that Twitter-based prevalence for anxiety symptoms had a positive and significant correlation with CDC-reported prevalence in phases 2 and 3 while a significant correlation for depressive symptoms was identified in phases 1 and 3. Positive correlations are identified between Twitter-based and CDC-reported prevalence, and temporal trends of these correlations were found. Geospatial differences in the prevalence of mental disorder symptoms were found between the northern and southern U.S. Findings from this study could inform the future investigation on leveraging social media platforms to estimate mental disorder symptoms and the provision of immediate prevention measures to improve health outcomes.","Cai, Zhang, Li, Zeng, Qiao, Li","https://doi.org/10.2196/37582","20221202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42004,""
"Psychological factors in adherence to COVID-19 public health restrictions in Italy: A path model testing depressed mood, anxiety, and co-rumination via cellphone","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the success of major non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine orders, has depended upon robust rates of citizens' adherence to protocols. Thus, it is critical to public health for research to illuminate factors that affect compliance with contagion-mitigating practices. Previous research has examined sociodemographic factors and aspects of psychological distress as correlates of adherence to public health guidelines. The current study expanded this research to investigate the psychosocial process of co-rumination, which has been identified in previous research as a maladaptive type of social interaction that is associated with elevated levels of anxiety and depression. Data were collected from 932 Italian adults during the initial stages of the highly stressful COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. A path model was tested to examine multivariate relationships among sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms of psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety), co-rumination via cellphone, and self-reported adherence to COVID-19-related public health restrictions. Results revealed that higher rates of co-rumination via cellphone were associated with lower levels of adherence to public health restrictions. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were differentially related to co-rumination processes and adherence to public health restrictions. Higher levels of depression symptoms were directly associated with poorer adherence to public health restrictions, and this path was mediated through higher levels of co-rumination via cellphone. On the contrary, higher levels of state anxiety were directly associated with greater adherence to public health guidelines. This path was also mediated through co-rumination via cellphone. Higher levels of anxiety were correlated with lower levels of co-rumination, which in turn were correlated with lower levels of adherence. These results suggest fruitful directions for future research examining co-rumination as a maladaptive coping behavior that may be addressed within public health interventions.","Balsamo, Murdock, Carlucci","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278628","20221202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42005,""

To inform clinical management of OUD patients, research is needed to identify characteristics associated with COVID-19 progression and death among this population. We aimed to investigate the role of OUD and specific comorbidities on COVID-19 progression among hospitalized OUD patients. Retrospective cohort study of merged electronic health records (EHR) from five large private health systems SETTING: New York City, New York, USA, 2011-2021 PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a COVID-19 encounter and OUD or opioid overdose diagnosis between March 2020-February 2021 MEASUREMENTS: Primary exposure included diagnosis of OUD/opioid overdose. Risk factors included age, sex, race/ethnicity and common medical, substance use and psychiatric co-morbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 severity. Outcomes included COVID-19 hospitalization and subsequent intubation, acute kidney failure, severe sepsis and death. Of 110,917 COVID-19+ adults, 1.17% were ever diagnosed with OUD/opioid overdose. OUD patients had higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33, 1.47]), intubation (adjusted aood ratio [aOR]: 2.05 [95% CI 1.74, 2.42]), kidney failure (aRR: 1.51 [95% CI 1.34, 1.70)), sepsis (aRR: 2.30 [95% CI 1.88, 2.81]), and death (aRR: 2.10 [95% CI 1.84, 2.40)]. Among hospitalized OUD patients, risks for COVID-19 outcomes included being male; older; of a race/ethnicity other than white, Black or Hispanic; and having co-morbid chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity or cancer. Protective factors included having asthma, hepatitis-C, and chronic pain. Opioid use disorder patients appears to have a substantial risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, with particular comorbidities and treatments potentially moderating this risk.","Krawczyk, Rivera, Basaraba, Corbeil, Allen, Schultebraucks, Henry, Pincus, Levin, Martinez","https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16105","20221202","COVID-19; electronic health records; hospital medicine; opioid use disorder; overdose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42006,""
"British Columbia's COVID-19 surveys on population experiences, action, and knowledge (SPEAK): methods and key findings from two large cross-sectional online surveys","To describe the methodology and key findings of British Columbia's (BC) COVID-19 SPEAK surveys, developed to understand the experiences, knowledge, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on British Columbians. Two province-wide, cross-sectional, web-based population health surveys were conducted one year apart (May 2020 and April/May 2021). Questions were drawn from validated sources grounded within the social determinants of health to assess COVID-19 testing and prevention; mental and physical health; risk and protective factors; and healthcare, social, and economic impacts during the pandemic. Quota-based non-probability sampling by geography was applied to recruit a representative sample aged 18 years and older. Recruitment included strategic outreach and longitudinal follow-up of a subgroup of respondents from round one to round two. Post-collection weighting using Census data by age, sex, education, ethnicity, and geography was conducted. Participants included 394,382 and 188,561 British Columbians for the first and second surveys, respectively, including a longitudinal subgroup of 141,728. Key findings showed that societal impacts, both early in the pandemic and one year later, were inequitably distributed. Families with children, young adults, and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have been most impacted. Significant negative impacts on mental health and stress and a deterioration in protective resiliency factors were found. These population health surveys consisting of two large cross-sectional samples provided valuable insight into the impacts and experiences of British Columbians early in the pandemic and one year later. Timely, actionable data informed several high-priority public health areas during BC's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Family functioning and quality of life among children with nephrotic syndrome during the first pandemic wave","During the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, one of the longest lockdowns worldwide occurred in Ontario, Canada, during the first wave. For parents and children managing care at home and at risk for COVID-19, the impact on their psychosocial functioning is unknown. A total of 122 families of children aged 2-18&#xa0;years were enrolled as part of the prospective cohort of childhood nephrotic syndrome and completed a survey during the first wave of the pandemic (August 21-December 10), 2020. In a subset, 107 families had data available pre-pandemic to assess change. Validated measures included the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) for parents and children&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;12&#xa0;years for family functioning, the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) for both parent and child, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PEDSQL&#x2122;-V4) for children only. Scores were compared using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Among the 107 children, 71% were male with a mean age of 9&#xa0;years old at the time of questionnaire completion, and the mean age of parents was 41&#xa0;years old. Parents and children reported that family functioning improved during COVID (parent: p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01; child: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Children's overall HRQOL declined (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), specifically increased sleep disruption (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01).

"Online Learning Stress and Chinese College Students' Academic Coping during COVID-19: The Role of&#xa0;Academic Hope and Academic Self-Efficacy","Colleges around the world have adopted emergency online learning to continue with teaching and learning activities during COVID-19. Existing research has indicated that this teaching mode is perceived negatively by many college students. The difficulty students encounter in emergency online learning can adversely affect their mental health and academic performance. To shed further light on how emergency online learning may have impeded college students' academic functioning and adjustment, this study examined the association between online learning stress and academic coping and the mediating roles of academic self-efficacy and academic hope. It was conducted in early 2021, a year after the outbreak of the pandemic. Ninety-nine Chinese college students in Hong Kong were recruited and they completed an online questionnaire for this study. Results showed that online learning stress was negatively associated with approach academic coping and social support seeking, and the associations were mediated by academic hope. On the other hand, online learning stress was positively associated with avoidance academic coping, which was not mediated by academic hope. The mediation effects of academic self-efficacy were all non-significant. In sum, college students used more passive and maladaptive coping to handle academic problems when they experienced more online learning stress, and this was partly explained by lower levels of academic hope.","Wong, Yuen","https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.2022.2148087","20221202","COVID-19; hope; online learning; self-efficacy; stress and coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42009,""
"Factors Associated with Mental Health of Medicare Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study examined factors associated with the mental health of Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement administered in the Fall of 2020 of beneficiaries aged &#x2265;65&#xa0;years was analyzed (<i>n =&#xa0;6,173</i>). A survey-weighted logistic model, adjusted for socio-demographics and comorbidities, was performed to examine factors (e.g., accessibility of medical/daily needs, financial security, and social connectivity) associated with stress/anxiety. Of Medicare beneficiaries, 40.8% reported feeling more stressed/anxious during the pandemic. Factors that were associated with this increased stress/anxiety include the inability to get home supplies (95% CI [3.4%, 16.5%]) or a doctor's appointment (95% CI [1.7%, 20.7%]), feeling less financially secure (95% CI [23.1%, 33.2%]) or socially connected (95% CI [19.1%, 25.6%]), and being female (95% CI [7.2%, 12.2%]), when compared with their respective counterparts. Non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to report feeling more stressed/anxious than non-Hispanic whites (95% CI [-19.9%, -9.0%]). Our findings highlight that beneficiaries' mental health was adversely influenced by the pandemic, particularly in those who felt financially insecure and socially disconnected. It is warranted to screen at risk beneficiaries for stress/anxiety during Medicare wellness visits and advocate for programs to reduce those risk factors.","Ng, Peach, Keith, Park, Li","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2022.2151962","20221202","COVID-19; anxiety; financially insecure; medicare beneficiaries; mental health; socially disconnected; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42010,""
"The challenges and experiences of academics supporting psychological capital among students at the emergence of COVID-19: A qualitative investigation of award-winning educators at a British university","Studies show that student mental health has continued to deteriorate over the years. Developing strengths-based approaches could aid educators in the development of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) and positive protective factors in students to support their mental well-being and aid in their success; however, little is known of the subject experience of educators who attempt this. This study aims to understand the experience of award-winning educators; both in their attempts to cultivate positive protective factors in students and in challenges to the pursuit of that goal during the shifting academic landscape at the emergence of COVID-19. Six award-winning educators from a British university. Participants were interviewed over video calls in this research design using semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. The results showed two major themes; pressures for academics and strength-based approached to cultivating PsyCap. These themes reflected that educators saw an urgent need for students to develop resilience as they struggle to handle subjective failure and that students struggle with imposter syndrome. The educators identified the challenges as feeling taken for granted, having unmanageable workloads along high expectations placed on them. COVID-19 has added significantly to the workloads of educators and demonstrated students' need for resilience. This research identifies the experiences of educators trying to improve strengths-based practice while identifying the challenges of pursuing that goal in the changing pedagogy post-COVID-19.","Morris, Hoelterhoff, Argyros","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12565","20221202","COVID-19 in academia; academia; higher education; psychological capital; strengths-based approach","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42011,""
"Psychological consequences of long COVID: comparing trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms before and after contracting SARS-CoV-2 between matched long- and short-COVID groups","There is a growing global awareness of the psychological consequences of long COVID, supported by emerging empirical evidence. However, the emergence and long-term trajectories of psychological symptoms following the infection are still unclear. To examine when psychological symptoms first emerge following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the long-term trajectories of psychological symptoms comparing long- and short-COVID groups. We analysed longitudinal data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study (March 2020 to November 2021). We included data from adults living in England who reported contracting SARS-CoV-2 by November 2021 (<i>n</i> = 3115). Of these, 15.9% reported having had long COVID (<i>n</i> = 495). They were matched to participants who had short COVID using propensity score matching on a variety of demographic, socioeconomic and health covariates (<i>n</i> = 962 individuals with 13 325 observations) and data were further analysed using growth curve modelling. Depressive and anxiety symptoms increased immediately following the onset of infection in both long- and short-COVID groups. But the long-COVID group had substantially greater initial increases in depressive symptoms and heightened levels over 22 months follow-up. Initial increases in anxiety were not significantly different between groups, but only the short-COVID group experienced an improvement in anxiety over follow-up, leading to widening differences between groups. The findings support work on the psychobiological pathways involved in the development of psychological symptoms relating to long COVID. The results highlight the need for monitoring of mental health and provision of adequate support to be interwoven with diagnosis and treatment of the physical consequences of long COVID.","Fancourt, Steptoe, Bu","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.155","20221202","Long COVID; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42012,""
"Suicidal ideation among people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: prevalence and associated factors","Evidence from pandemic and pre-pandemic studies conducted globally indicates that people with disabilities (PWDs) have a higher risk for suicidality. However, none of these studies has assessed suicidality among PWDs in Bangladesh. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal ideation among PWDs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Using a snowball sampling technique, a cross-sectional survey was conducted from February to April 2021 among PWDs from six districts in the northern region of Bangladesh. Information related to sociodemographic factors, clinical characteristics, behavioural factors and suicidal ideation was collected. Chi-squared test and logistic regression were used to describe the data and explain the relationship of factors associated with suicidal ideation. The prevalence of COVID-19-related past-year suicidal ideation was 23.9%. The factors associated with suicidal ideation included: age above 35 years, being female, acquiring a disability later in life, lack of sleep and current substance use. In addition, higher education appeared to be a protective factor against suicidal ideation. This study highlighted that PWDs had an increased risk of suicide; that is, one-fourth of them had past-year suicidal ideation. This may have been because of COVID-19-related restrictions and stressors. Thus, the government and policy makers need to pay more attention to developing effective suicide assessment, treatment and management strategies, especially for at-risk groups, to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Roy, Amin, Mamun, Hossain, Aktarujjaman, Sarker","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.615","20221202","Bangladesh; COVID-19; people with disabilities; suicidal ideation; suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42013,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Student's Dental Education and Life","We sought to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Oman Dental College (ODC) students' management of their educational and student life. We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional online survey study using SurveyMonkey. During the 2019-2020 academic year, 383 ODC students across six levels of education were invited to participate in the survey. Descriptive statistics were applied to the students' demographic profiles, and other characteristics of the participants' data were analyzed. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for internal consistency. A univariate analysis was carried out to identify the differences between genders and between the Bachelor of Dental Surgery levels in relation to the questionnaire themes. A Pearson's correlation test evaluated the association between students' perception of risks due to the pandemic and the other relevant themes. A 50.9% response rate revealed that five of the themes showed internal reliability ranging from excellent to acceptable, namely: performance of exercise, effect of the pandemic on their families, use of a facemask, college's online services, and students' mental health (0.51, 0.59, 0.70, 0.78, and 0.90, respectively). More than half of the participants felt encouraged to engage in self-directed learning using online resources. They felt some level of nervousness, worry, anxiety, or tension as well as stress during the pandemic. Statistical differences between levels of education were noted in the ODC's-online teaching services (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and students' mental health (<i>p =</i> 0.03). There was no difference between female and male students. The ODC's online services theme positively related to the students' mental health theme (r = 0.22, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). ODC students experienced some mental health issues during the pandemic, including anxiety, stress, and sleeping issues. However, the majority of them were healthy. Most students were satisfied with the online teaching provided by ODC. It was also evident that faculty were always connected with the students. A positive relationship was noted between the management of online lectures and students' mental health.","Al Rawahi, Al Harthy, Singh, Al Isamili","https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2022.102","20221203","Academic Performance; COVID-19; Mental Health; Oman; Pandemics; Perception; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42014,""
"Barriers and enablers to accessing support services offered by staff wellbeing hubs: A qualitative study","International efforts have been made to develop appropriate interventions to support the mental health needs of healthcare professionals in response to COVID-19. However, fewer staff have accessed these than expected, despite experiencing elevated levels of mental distress since the onset of the pandemic. Consequently, we aimed to examine the barriers and enablers for healthcare professionals in accessing interventions offered by a Staff Mental Health and Wellbeing Hub. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare, social care and voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector staff. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four key themes were identified: (1) <i>Environment and Atmosphere in the Workplace</i>; (2) <i>The Impacts of COVID-19</i>; (3) <i>Confidentiality</i>; and (4) <i>Awareness and Communication of Resources</i>. Organisational environments were perceived as an important enabler of accessing the hub services for mental health and wellbeing support. This included the importance of recognising and responding to the ongoing pressures of COVID-19- specific challenges. Ensuring and communicating aspects of confidentiality, and ensuring clear and consistent communication of the benefits of the Hub may encourage help-seeking for mental health challenges among healthcare professionals. Our findings highlight important considerations to increase uptake and engagement with services to support the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare professionals and associated staff and volunteers. Organisations aiming to increase employee uptake of these services should regularly circulate consistent and clear emails about what these services offer, provide training and information for managers so they can support staff to access these services and ensure access is confidential.","Keyworth, Alzahrani, Pointon, Hinsby, Wainwright, Moores, Bates, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1008913","20221203","healthcare professionals; healthcare workers; mental health; qualitative; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42015,""
"Exploring the roles of fear and powerlessness in the relationship between perceived risk of the COVID-19 pandemic and information-avoidance behavior","The COVID-19 has seriously impacted various aspects of the society on a global scale. However, it is still unclear how perceived risk influences epidemic information-avoidance behavior which generally helps us understand public information avoidance. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the perceived epidemic risk and information-avoidance behavior and the mediating role of fear and powerlessness during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A total of 557 Chinese respondents with COVID-19 treated in modular hospitals ranging from 16 to 72 years old were recruited and completed questionnaires in the face-to-face manner containing scales of the perceived epidemic risk of COVID-19, fear, powerlessness, and information-avoidance behavior. To test the conceptual model, we adopted structural equation modeling (SEM) with the perceived risk of the COVID-19 pandemic as a predictor, fear and powerlessness as mediating variables, and information-avoidance behavior as the outcome. The results indicated a significant and positive association between the perceived epidemic risk of COVID-19 and information-avoidance behavior. Powerlessness acted as the mediator between the perceived epidemic risk of COVID-19 and information-avoidance behavior. The perceived epidemic risk of COVID-19 influenced information-avoidance behavior through fear and powerlessness in turn. Findings from this study implied that public health managers should consider the mediating roles of negative emotions such as fear and powerlessness for coping with behaviors in public health emergencies, especially the information avoidance behaviors related to risk perception.","Zhang, Zhang, Wang, Jiang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1005142","20221203","COVID-19; fear; information-avoidance behavior; perceived epidemic risk; powerlessness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42016,""
"Telepsychology for Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury: Protocol for a Randomized Control Study of Video-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","A substantial proportion of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience depression, which has been negatively associated with recovery and community participation after injury. Despite significant barriers to seeking and receiving in-person mental health care, little research has focused on the efficacy of telepsychology among individuals with SCI. To describe the design and implementation of an ongoing single-center, randomized controlled, video-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention among individuals with SCI. Participants within 1 year of SCI will be randomized 1:1 to intervention or usual care in a 24-week study. Intervention participants will engage in 10 sessions of CBT over 12 weeks with a licensed clinical psychologist, using iPads via Apple FaceTime. Primary outcomes are depressive symptomatology, anxiety, and life satisfaction (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Satisfaction with Life Scale, respectively) measured at three time points (baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks). These and other measures are also assessed during monthly telephone surveys conducted between primary timepoints. Recruitment is ongoing. Forty-six participants have been enrolled thus far. Telepsychology is a convenient, flexible, and effective alternative to traditional in-person services. We anticipate that intervention participants will experience improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms and will have greater life satisfaction. Telepsychology interventions among individuals with SCI are tasked to maintain participant privacy, provide assistive technology and/or engage caregivers to minimize mobility limitations, and manage risk remotely. Challenges encountered include recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early intervention on symptoms of psychological morbidity using telepsychology may facilitate greater adaptation following SCI.","Pasipanodya, Khong, Dirlikov, Prutton, Held, Shem","https://doi.org/10.46292/sci22-00010","20221205","cognitive behavioral therapy; evidence-based psychotherapy; mHealth; mobile health technology; spinal cord injury; telemedicine; Humans; Spinal Cord Injuries; Pandemics; COVID-19; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Self-Help Devices; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42017,""
"The influence of arts engagement on the mental health of isolated college students during the COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the mental health of college students. This study aimed to investigate the buffering effect of arts engagement on anxiety and resilience in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study. The data were collected <i>via</i> an online survey during a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Shanghai (March 15 to April 15, 2022). In total, 2,453 college students throughout China reported general anxiety symptom levels (according to the GAD-7), resilience (according to the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), frequency of receptive arts engagement in the previous year, exposure to risk situations, and behavioral changes due to the pandemic. During the current stage of the pandemic, 43.7% of college students suffered from varying degrees of anxiety, and 2.6% showed severe anxiety. Gender and learning stage were not associated with anxiety. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the decision to return to academic institution, the degree of exposure to COVID-19, and the frequency of accepting art participation and resilience could significantly predict the anxiety level of college students. Gender, study stage, behavioral changes arising from COVID-19, and exposure to COVID-19 significantly predict the resilience level of college students. There was an association between high frequency music activities, reading activities and low anxiety level (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was an association between high frequency digital art, music activities, reading and high resilience (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

"The Relationship of Adverse Childhood Experiences and Emotional Distress in Young Adults","Emerging evidence notes increased depression, anxiety, and stress among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about populations at increased risk for emotional distress as the pandemic continues. Persons with adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are one group that may be at higher risk for emotional distress. The aim of this study is to examine whether young adults, particularly Black young adults, with histories of ACEs report more emotional distress during the pandemic than those with no ACE exposure. Using a cross-sectional, quota sampling approach, 100 Black and 100 White young adults were recruited using online sources (e.g., University website, Facebook). Due to the pandemic, participants were screened via Zoom and, if eligible, completed a demographic questionnaire, emotional distress measures (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress), and the ACE Questionnaire online via a Qualtrics survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis examined the ACE and emotional distress relationship, and multigroup SEM assessed racial differences. High levels of both emotional distress and ACEs were observed. Black young adults reported significantly more ACEs than Whites. ACEs were significantly associated with each measure of emotional distress regardless of race or other covariates. Findings reveal that during the pandemic, persons exposed to ACEs reported greater emotional distress than those with no ACE exposure. Nurses must screen patients for both emotional distress and ACE to target those at higher risk for early intervention and initiate treatment as needed to mitigate long-term mental health consequences.","Solberg, Peters, Templin, Albdour","https://doi.org/10.1177/10783903221140325","20221202","abuse; anxiety and anxiety disorders; depression and depressive disorders; minority populations; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42019,""
"The psychological impact, risk factors and coping strategies to COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in the sub-Saharan Africa: a narrative review of existing literature","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the physical and mental health of the general population worldwide, with healthcare workers at particular risk. The pandemic's effect on healthcare workers' mental well-being has been characterized by depression, anxiety, work-related stress, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Hence, protecting the mental well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs) is a considerable priority. This review aimed to determine risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes and protective or coping measures to mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 crisis among HCWs in sub-Saharan Africa. We performed a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Embase for relevant materials. We obtained all articles published between March 2020 and April 2022 relevant to the subject of review and met pre-defined eligibility criteria. We selected 23 articles for initial screening and included 12 in the final review. A total of 5,323 participants in twelve studies, predominantly from Ethiopia (eight studies), one from Uganda, Cameroon, Mali, and Togo, fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Investigators found 16.3-71.9% of HCWs with depressive symptoms, 21.9-73.5% with anxiety symptoms, 15.5-63.7% experienced work-related stress symptoms, 12.4-77% experienced sleep disturbances, and 51.6-56.8% reported PTSD symptoms. Healthcare workers, working in emergency, intensive care units, pharmacies, and laboratories were at higher risk of adverse mental health impacts. HCWs had deep fear, anxious and stressed with the high transmission rate of the virus, high death rates, and lived in fear of infecting themselves and families. Other sources of fear and work-related stress were the lack of PPEs, availability of treatment and vaccines to protect themselves against the virus. HCWs faced stigma, abuse, financial problems, and lack of support from employers and communities. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD in HCWs in sub-Saharan Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic has been high. Several organizational, community, and work-related challenges and interventions were identified, including improvement of workplace infrastructures, adoption of correct and shared infection control measures, provision of PPEs, social support, and implementation of resilience training programs. Setting up permanent multidisciplinary mental health teams at regional and national levels to deal with mental health and providing psychological support to HCWs, supported with long-term surveillance, are recommended.","Oyat, Oloya, Atim, Ikoona, Aloyo, Kitara","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00998-z","20221205","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health surveillance; Occupational health and safety; Social support; Workplace organization; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Health Personnel; Adaptation, Psychological; Risk Factors; Occupational Stress; Sleep Wake Disorders; Ethiopia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42020,""

The primary objective of this study was to examine if mental health was associated with perceived access to healthcare during the pandemic METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from 23,972 participants (aged 50-96) in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging COVID-19 Exit Survey (Sept-Dec 2020). We used logistic regression to estimate how the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms, defined using scores of &#x2265;10 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and &#x2265;10 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, were associated with the odds of reporting: 1) challenges accessing healthcare, 2) not going to a hospital or seeing a doctor when needed, 3) experiencing barriers to COVID-19 testing. Models were adjusted for sex, age, region, urban/rural residence, racial background, immigrant status, income, marital status, work status, chronic conditions, and pre-pandemic unmet needs. The presence of depressive (aOR=1.96; 95% CI=1.82, 2.11) and anxiety symptoms (aOR=2.33; 95% CI=2.04, 2.66) compared to the absence of these symptoms were independently associated with higher odds of challenges accessing healthcare. A statistically significant interaction with sex suggested stronger associations in females with anxiety. Symptoms of depression (aOR=2.88; 95% CI=2.58, 3.21) and anxiety (aOR=3.05; 95% CI=2.58, 3.60) were also associated with increased odds of not going to a hospital or seeing a doctor when needed. Lastly, depressive (aOR=1.99; 95% CI=1.71, 2.31) and anxiety symptoms (aOR=2.01; 95% CI=1.58, 2.56) were associated with higher odds of reporting barriers to COVID-19 testing. There was no significantly significant interaction with sex for the latter two outcomes. The presence of depression and anxiety symptoms were strongly associated with perceived unmet healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions to improve healthcare access for adults with depression and anxiety during the pandemic may be necessary.","Khattar, Griffith, Jones, De Rubeis, de Groh, Jiang, Basta, Kirkland, Wolfson, Raina, Anderson, Costa, Balion, Asada, Cossette, Levasseur, Hofer, Paterson, Hogan, McMillan, Liu-Ambrose, Menec, St John, Mugford, Gao, Taler, Davidson, Wister, Cosco","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14633-4","20221205","Anxiety; CLSA; Depression; Unmet healthcare needs; Adult; Female; Humans; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pandemics; Longitudinal Studies; COVID-19 Testing; Depression; Canada; Anxiety; Aging; Health Services Accessibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42021,""
"Supporting MRT mental health: Through COVID-19 and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an exceptional impact on the healthcare profession, and in particular, on the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare workers. The Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists (CAMRT) has been working on ways to prioritize the mental health of their members while increasing advocacy efforts. Conducting a national survey on mental health and interviewing medical radiation technologists (MRTs) highlighted the challenges that exist while also informing which support system components are most needed to improve wellbeing. The purpose of the research is to share the lived experience of Canadian MRTs in relation to their mental health during the pandemic. It adds to the knowledge gained from the survey by exploring in depth accounts of what MRTs felt and experienced during COVID-19. Understanding this challenging time period may aid in developing additional resources and support for MRTs in the workplace. The overall message in healthcare should be, optimize your wellbeing and your patients will be taken care of too. Recommendations to foster this message includes empowering MRTs to advocate for their mental health and wellbeing, promoting timely and adequate supports, monitoring the mental health of our professional landscape and welcoming others to join the conversation. This paper examines what mental health supports are recommended by the MRTs who were interviewed, and the information gathered from the CAMRT Mental Health of Medical Radiation Technologists in Canada 2021 Survey.","Corrente, Zychla, Given, Mihailescu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2022.11.008","20221201","Health personnel; Health promotion; Mental health; policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42022,""
"What impact does the attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination have on physicians as vaccine providers? A cross sectional study from the German outpatient sector","COVID-19 vaccination is recognized as a key component in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Physicians' attitudes toward vaccination are known to play a defining role in the management and dissemination of medical advice to patients. In Germany, outpatient practitioners are predominantly responsible for the dissemination of vaccines. Using a cross-sectional online survey, 932 outpatient general practitioners, gynecologists, and pediatricians in Germany were asked in fall, 2021, about their attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination and - among others - their communication in vaccine discussions, their assessment of vaccine safety, and reporting of suspected adverse events. Physicians were divided into two groups along their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, multivariate linear regression models were constructed to assess differences in communication strategies. 92&#xa0;% of physicians had a positive or very positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination. Own vaccination status, practice-based vaccination delivery, and estimated vaccination coverage among patients were significantly associated with the attitude toward vaccination. Confidence in vaccine safety was significantly lower among physicians with negative attitudes. There were no differences between the two groups in self-assessment of the ability to detect suspected adverse events, but there were differences in the observing and reporting of adverse events. For the linear regression models, we found that a more negative attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination was significantly associated with increased acceptance of patient refusal of COVID-19 vaccination and empathic behavior for patient concerns. In contrast, willingness to engage in a detailed persuasion consultation was significantly lower. Pediatricians showed significantly higher empathy for patient-side concerns compared to general practitioners, whereas gynecologists showed less empathy than general practitioners. The physician's attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination influences the physician's practices as a vaccine provider. However, when providing medical advice and healthcare, the physician should focus on the actual needs of the patient.","St&#xf6;cker, Hoffmann, Mause, Neufeind, Ohnh&#xe4;user, Scholten","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.054","20221201","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccines; Cross-sectional studies; Health education; Outpatients; Persuasive communication; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42023,""
"Personalised digital technology for mental health in the armed forces: the potential, the hype and the dangers","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a digital technology revolution which included widespread use in remote healthcare settings, remote working and use of technology to support friends and family to stay in touch. The armed forces have also increased its use of digital technology, but not at the same rate, and it is important that they do not fall behind in the revolution. One area where digital technology could be helpful is the treatment and management of mental health conditions. In a civilian setting, digital technology adoption has been found to be acceptable and feasible yet there is little use in the armed forces. In this personal view, we explore the potential use of personalised digital technology for mental health, the hype surrounding it and the dangers.This paper forms part of the special issue of <i>BMJ Military Health</i> dedicated to personalised digital technology for mental health in the armed forces.","Leightley, Murphy","https://doi.org/10.1136/military-2022-002279","20221201","Health informatics; MENTAL HEALTH; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42024,""
"[The Spread of the Epidemic Among Vulnerable Groups and Related Epidemic Prevention Issues]","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the adverse health, economic and social consequences of longstanding social inequality on various communities, groups, and individuals. Because they lack sufficient access to health and social resources, vulnerable groups affected by lower incomes, geographic remoteness, and/or low awareness of disease prevention and control measures are more susceptible to infection (McDonald, 2022; Mein, 2020; Moghanibashi-Mansourieh, 2021). According to The Lancet (2020) editorial board, vulnerable groups are defined as segments of the population disproportionately exposed to risk. People not considered vulnerable at the start of the pandemic may become vulnerable afterward due to pandemic-related effects such as loss of income and lack of access to social support. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable groups include not only traditionally vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults, infants, immuno-compromised individuals) but socioeconomic groups that may be financially, mentally, or physically struggling to cope. In addition, schools of all levels around the world have adopted remote online synchronous or asynchronous teaching methods to avoid pandemic-related school closures and interruptions in student learning (Dreesen et al., 2020). However, issues such as the accessibility, availability, acceptability, and applicability of online learning equipment for vulnerable students should be comprehensively considered by the government. Governments encounter multiple challenges related to the above-mentioned issues, including (1) dealing with the public health effects of the pandemic crisis; (2) dealing with related economic and social impacts such as social and economic depression due to isolation, tax reductions, increased payments, subsidies, compensation, and the provision of unemployment insurance (Moghanibashi-Mansourieh, 2021); and (3) reforming education teaching methods and providing appropriate information and equipment of vulnerable groups. In responding to COVID-19, policymakers should consider the risks of exacerbating the inequalities faced by vulnerable groups. Moreover, vulnerable groups should be clearly identified to limit the long-term consequences of the pandemic. Governments must continually identify vulnerable / at-risk populations and provide equitable support to those most at risk. &#x75ab;&#x60c5;&#x8513;&#x5ef6;&#x8207;&#x5f31;&#x52e2;&#x65cf;&#x7fa4;&#x9632;&#x75ab;&#x8b70;&#x984c;. &#x56b4;&#x91cd;&#x7279;&#x6b8a;&#x50b3;&#x67d3;&#x6027;&#x80ba;&#x708e;&#xff08;COVID-19&#xff09;&#x5927;&#x6d41;&#x884c;&#x51f8;&#x986f;&#x4e86;&#x9577;&#x671f;&#x5b58;&#x5728;&#x7684;&#x793e;&#x6703;&#x4e0d;&#x5e73;&#x7b49;&#x73fe;&#x8c61;&#xff0c;&#x5c0d;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;&#x7684;&#x793e;&#x5340;&#x3001;&#x65cf;&#x7fa4;&#x548c;&#x500b;&#x4eba;&#x9020;&#x6210;&#x4e86;&#x4e0d;&#x5229;&#x7684;&#x5065;&#x5eb7;&#x3001;&#x7d93;&#x6fdf;&#x548c;&#x793e;&#x6703;&#x5f8c;&#x679c;&#xff0c;&#x5c24;&#x5176;&#x662f;&#x7f3a;&#x4e4f;&#x5065;&#x5eb7;&#x548c;&#x793e;&#x6703;&#x8cc7;&#x6e90;&#x3001;&#x6536;&#x5165;&#x8f03;&#x4f4e;&#x3001;&#x504f;&#x9060;&#x5730;&#x5340;&#x548c;&#x75be;&#x75c5;&#x9632;&#x6cbb;&#x610f;&#x8b58;&#x4e0d;&#x5f37;&#x7b49;&#x7684;&#x5f31;&#x52e2;&#x7fa4;&#x9ad4;&#x66f4;&#x5bb9;&#x6613;&#x611f;&#x67d3;&#xff08;McDonald, 2022;

"The Commonwealth Criminal Code restricts the use of carriage services to access voluntary assisted dying in Victoria: a perspective","A major barrier to Victorians with a terminal illness accessing voluntary assisted dying is the Commonwealth Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) 2005 (the Code), which prohibits the use of any electronic forms of communication when discussing suicide. The proliferation of telehealth as a means of access to medical practitioners as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the anachronistic prohibition of such communication in relation to voluntary assisted dying, particularly in Victoria, as the federal law arguably prohibits its use.

"Estimating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Rising Trends in Drug Overdose Mortality in the United States, 2018-2021","During the COVID-19 pandemic, social and economic disruption such as social isolation, job and income losses, and increased psychological distress, may have contributed to the increase in drug-overdose mortality. This study aims to measure the impact of the pandemic on monthly trends in drug-overdose mortality in the United States. We used the 2018-2020 final and 2021 provisional monthly deaths from the National Vital Statistics System and monthly population estimates from the Census Bureau to compute monthly mortality rates by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We use log-linear regression models to estimate monthly percent increases in mortality rates from January 2018 through November 2021. The age-adjusted drug-overdose mortality rate among individuals aged &#x2265;15 years increased by 30% between 2019 (70,459 deaths) and 2020 (91,536 deaths). During January 2018-November 2021, the monthly drug-overdose mortality rate increased by 2.05% per month for Blacks, 2.25% for American Indians/Alaska Natives, 1.96% for Hispanics, 1.33% for Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 0.96% for non-Hispanic Whites. Average monthly increases in mortality were most marked among those aged 15-24 and 35-44 years. The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on the rising trends in drug-overdose mortality during the peak months in 2020 and 2021.","Lee, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.11.007","20221201","COVID-19 pandemic; Drug overdose mortality; age-specific; monthly trend; race/ethnicity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42027,""
"Impacts of mental health in the sleep pattern of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","After &gt;2&#x202f;years of the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is well established how sleep symptoms are rising, especially among healthcare workers (HCW). The aim of this study is to evaluate what features are associated with sleep disturbances in the HCW population. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of social and clinical variables associated with sleep problems and insomnia incidence in HCW in a large, national-level cohort. The measurement of sleep problems was assessed by self-report using Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS). A multivariate analysis was used in the cross-sectional design and generalized linear models were used in the longitudinal design. 10,467 HCW were analyzed in the cross-sectional analysis, 3313 participants were analyzed in the three timepoints of the study. Sex, previously diagnosed mental illness and frontline work with COVID-19 were associated with higher scores in JSS in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only previous diagnosis of mental illness was related with sleep difficulties, especially previously diagnosed insomnia. The longitudinal analysis concluded that previous diagnosis of mental illnesses was associated with higher levels of insomnia development (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;11.62). The self-reported disorders found to be major risk factors were addiction (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;7.69), generalized anxiety disorder (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.67), social anxiety (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.21) and bipolar disorder (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.21).

"Facilitating Access to Healthcare for Performing Artists Using Subsidized Health Services in Canada: An Interpretive Descriptive Study","Performing artists are often confronted with job insecurity and insufficient health coverage. As a result, artists may not have access to non-publicly funded health services that are essential to their well-being. A health centre in Canada that specializes in providing healthcare to artists offers eligible artists subsidized health services, with the aim to treat acute health issues that impact an artists' ability to engage in their artistic practice. We evaluated the use of the subsidized health services and explored the subsidy recipients' and the selection committee's perspectives on the impact of these services on the health of performing artists. We applied an interpretive descriptive approach to our qualitative inquiry. We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with recipients of the subsidy and a focus group with the selection committee that selected recipients of the subsidy. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. A total of 14 artists and all members of the selection committee (n=3) participated. Recipients and selection committee perceived that subsidized health services were critical in enabling consistent and timely diagnosis and treatment. Several themes emerged from the data: 1) need for universal health benefits to restore equity and offset healthcare insecurity, 2) the critical role of subsidies in accessing health services, 3) risks of abruptly ending health services when subsidy runs out, 4) barriers in applying for and accessing subsidies, 5) mental health challenges, and 6) importance of the subsidy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. All recipients saw noticeable improvement in health outcomes that they believed would have been otherwise unattainable if they did not have timely access to care. Subsidized health services play an important role in ensuring that performing artists have access to care for injuries and health conditions that are related to their profession. Future research can examine the long-term impact of subsidized services on the recipients' health and employment outcomes.","Li, Donn","https://doi.org/10.21091/mppa.2022.4030","20221205","Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Health Services; Canada; Delivery of Health Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42029,""
"Evaluating resilience in response to COVID-19 pandemic stressors among veteran mental health outpatients","There is a public health need to understand mental health vulnerabilities to COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors and promote resilience among high-risk populations with preexisting psychiatric conditions. Recent cross-sectional studies suggest increases in mental health distress (e.g., depression and anxiety) during the pandemic. The present study expands upon these emerging findings using longitudinal latent modeling and hierarchical linear regressions. Consistent with the developmental psychopathology literature on resilience, we distinguished between promotive or risk (i.e., main effect), and protective or vulnerability (i.e., moderation) effects on mental health during the pandemic. At a large medical center, 398 veterans receiving outpatient mental health care provided prepandemic (Time 1) and during pandemic (Time 2) assessments of mental and physical health-related distress. Additional Time 2 questionnaires assessed pandemic-related stressors and positive behavioral adaptations in the summer of 2020. As expected, total stressor scores predicted longitudinal worsening of self-reported mental (&#x3b2; = -.205) and physical health (&#x3b2; = -.217). Positive behavioral adaptations enacted during the pandemic moderated and protected against stressor effects on mental health (&#x3b2; = .160). In addition, the presence of substance use disorders moderated and conferred vulnerability to stressor effects on physical health (&#x3b2; = -.158). Thus, higher COVID-19 pandemic stressor exposure may have exacerbated mental and physical health distress among veterans with common forms of psychopathology. Nevertheless, behavioral activation, purposeful maintenance of social connections, and focused treatment for substance misuse may be important intervention targets for reducing the longitudinal impact of pandemic stressors and enhancing resilience among people with mental illness.

"Providing Housing First services for an underserved population during the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","We assessed the critical role of Housing First (HF) programs and frontline workers in responding to challenges faced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine HF frontline workers from three HF programs between May 2020 and July 2020, in Toronto, Canada. Information was collected on challenges and adjustments needed to provide services to HF clients (people experiencing homelessness and mental disorders). We applied the Analytical Framework method and thematic analysis to our data. Inability to provide in-person support and socializing activities, barriers to appropriate mental health assessments, and limited virtual communication due to clients' lack of access to digital devices were among the most salient challenges that HF frontline workers reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing virtual support services, provision of urgent in-office or in-field support, distributing food aid, connecting clients with online healthcare services, increasing harm reduction education and referral, and meeting urgent housing needs were some of the strategies implemented by HF frontline workers to support the complex needs of their clients during the pandemic. HF frontline workers experienced workload burden, job insecurity and mental health problems (e.g. distress, worry, anxiety) as a consequence of their services during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the several work-, programming- and structural-related challenges experienced by HF frontline workers when responding to the needs of their clients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, they played a critical role in meeting the communication, food, housing and health needs of their clients during the pandemic, even when it negatively affected their well-being. A more coordinated, integrated, innovative, sustainable, effective and well-funded support response is required to meet the intersecting and complex social, housing, health and financial needs of underserved and socio-economically excluded groups during and beyond health emergencies.","Mejia-Lancheros, Lachaud, Gogosis, Thulien, Stergiopoulos, Da Silva, Nisenbaum, O'Campo, Hwang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278459","20221205","Humans; Vulnerable Populations; COVID-19; Pandemics; Housing; Qualitative Research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42031,""
"Changes in psychological distress among Polish medical university teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Our study aims to update knowledge about psychological distress and its changes in the Polish group of academic medical teachers after two years of a global pandemic. During the coronavirus disease, teachers were challenged to rapidly transition into remote teaching and adapt new assessment and evaluation systems for students, which might have been a completely novel situation that was not addressed before, especially in medical universities in Poland. We conducted a cross-sectional study at Poznan University of Medical Sciences from March to April 2022. The questionnaire included self-reported information on anxiety, stress, and depression. We found that post-pandemic levels of anxiety, stress, and depression have significantly (p&lt;0.001) improved compared to initial levels at the beginning of coronavirus disease. In multivariate models, females had higher odds of improving levels of anxiety (OR&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.46; 95% CI&#x2009; = &#x2009;-1.58-(-0.03); p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.04), stress (OR&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.36; 95% CI&#x2009; = &#x2009;-1.83-(-0.22); p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.01), and depression (OR&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.0.37; 95% CI&#x2009; = &#x2009;-1.58-(-0.12); p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.03). Anxiety, stress, or depression were not significantly associated with years of experience, the number of taught subjects, and weekly teaching hours, but only with the academic work during COVID-19 (Spearman ranxiety = 0.37, rstress = 0.32, rdepression = 0.37, p&lt;0.001). For the virtual learning concerns, 79% of teachers reported that students might engage less; and it was correlated with higher weekly teaching hours (r = 0.19, p&lt;0.05). Even though only 29.8% reported cheating as a concern, it was correlated with a higher number of taught subjects (r = 0.2, p&lt;0.05). Levels of anxiety, stress, and depression have improved as time passed, not affecting teachers' academic performance. Concerns about virtual learning have been raised, suggesting it may be conjoined with classroom learning but not as an alternative. Universities should highlight the importance of seeking psychological support and provide essential programs to employees. Teachers' coping skills with psychological distress should be further studied.","Wojtera, Singh, Iankovitch, Post, Ahmed, Abouzid","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278311","20221205","Female; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Poland; Universities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Psychological Distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42032,""
"Training load, sports performance, physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective cohort of Swiss elite athletes","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions have led to abrupt changes in the lives of elite athletes. The objective of this prospective cohort study was to examine training load, subjective sports performance, physical and mental health among Swiss elite athletes during a 6-month follow-up period starting with the first Swiss lockdown. Swiss elite athletes (n = 203) participated in a repeated online survey evaluating health, training, and performance related metrics. After the first assessment during the first lockdown between April and May 2020, there were monthly follow-ups over 6 months. Out of 203 athletes completing the first survey during the first lockdown, 73 athletes (36%) completed all assessments during the entire 6-month follow-up period. Sports performance and training load decreased during the first lockdown and increased again at the beginning of the second lockdown in October 2020, while symptoms of depression and financial fears showed only a transient increase during the first lockdown. Self-reported injuries and illnesses did not change significantly at any timepoint in the study. Stricter COVID-19 restrictions, as measured by the Government Stringency Index (GSI), were associated with reduced subjective sports performance, as well as lower training intensity, increased financial fears, poorer coping with restrictions, and more depressive symptoms, as measured by the 9-item module of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study revealed a negative impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on sports performance, training load and mental health among Swiss elite athletes, while the rate of self-reported injuries and illnesses remained unaffected.","Karrer, Fr&#xf6;hlich, Iff, Sp&#xf6;rri, Scherr, Seifritz, Quednow, Claussen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278203","20221205","Humans; Mental Health; COVID-19; Prospective Studies; Pandemics; Switzerland; Communicable Disease Control; Athletes; Athletic Performance; Cohort Studies; Physical Functional Performance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42033,""
"Sleep quality among workers in the health sector exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic","The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global health crisis that has posed enormous pressure on workers in the health sector (WHS), having a massive impact on their mental health. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the sleep quality of WHS during the pandemic and compare frontline WHS to those who are not directly engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional, self-reported online survey assessed the sleep quality of WHS in Austria using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The same questionnaire was sent out two times. Due to the unequal sample and anonymity of the study participants, we analyzed the data of each time point separate from each other. The first study was conducted in April/May 2020, during the first lockdown in Austria (Study1), and the second study was conducted in July/August 2020, when the social restrictions were loosened (Study2). T-test was used to compare the mean values of PSQI scores between frontline vs. non-frontline WHS, while two two-way ANCOVAs were used to analyze differences in the PSQI mean scores (controlled for age) for male vs. female between frontline vs. non-frontline WHS. During the first lockdown in Austria (Study1) we identified a shorter sleep duration of frontline WHS compared to the non-frontline group, however the difference in global PSQI score between these groups was statistically not significant. In the period after loosened restrictions (Study2) the sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency and global PSQI score was worse in frontline WHS compared to the non-frontline WHS. Furthermore, female WHS scored higher in the PSQI indicating a worse sleep than male WHS. In addition, nurses and nursing assistants had a higher prevalence of poor sleep quality than other occupational groups. Our results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts the sleep of WHS, affecting particularly frontline WHS. Preventive interventions aiming to promote good sleep quality in WHS during a healthcare crisis like this pandemic are essential to enhance resilience and mitigate the vulnerability of this specific population.","Tmava-Berisha, Fellendorf, Ratzenhofer, Maget, Platzer, Bengesser, Birner, Queissner, Sch&#xf6;nthaler, Dalkner, Lenger, Reininghaus","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268933","20221205","Humans; Female; Male; Pandemics; COVID-19; Sleep Quality; Cross-Sectional Studies; Communicable Disease Control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42034,""
"Association of Initial SARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity With Patient-Reported Well-being 3 Months After a Symptomatic Illness","Long-term sequelae after symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact well-being, yet existing data primarily focus on discrete symptoms and/or health care use. To compare patient-reported outcomes of physical, mental, and social well-being among adults with symptomatic illness who received a positive vs negative test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cohort study was a planned interim analysis of an ongoing multicenter prospective longitudinal registry study (the Innovative Support for Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infections Registry [INSPIRE]). Participants were enrolled from December 11, 2020, to September 10, 2021, and comprised adults (aged &#x2265;18 years) with acute symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 test approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The analysis included the first 1000 participants who completed baseline and 3-month follow-up surveys consisting of questions from the 29-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29; 7 subscales, including physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, social participation, sleep disturbance, and pain interference) and the PROMIS Short Form-Cognitive Function 8a scale, for which population-normed T scores were reported. SARS-CoV-2 status (positive or negative test result) at enrollment. Mean PROMIS scores for participants with positive COVID-19 tests vs negative COVID-19 tests were compared descriptively and using multivariable regression analysis. Among 1000 participants, 722 (72.2%) received a positive COVID-19 result and 278 (27.8%) received a negative result; 406 of 998 participants (40.7%) were aged 18 to 34 years, 644 of 972 (66.3%) were female, 833 of 984 (84.7%) were non-Hispanic, and 685 of 974 (70.3%) were White. A total of 282 of 712 participants (39.6%) in the COVID-19-positive group and 147 of 275 participants (53.5%) in the COVID-19-negative group reported persistently poor physical, mental, or social well-being at 3-month follow-up. After adjustment, improvements in well-being were statistically and clinically greater for participants in the COVID-19-positive group vs the COVID-19-negative group only for social participation (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.32; 95% CI, 1.84-4.80; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001); changes in other well-being domains were not clinically different between groups. Improvements in well-being in the COVID-19-positive group were concentrated among participants aged 18 to 34 years (eg, social participation: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.90; 95% CI, 1.75-6.05; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and those who presented for COVID-19 testing in an ambulatory setting (eg, social participation: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.16; 95% CI, 2.12-6.20; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). In this study, participants in both the COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative groups reported persistently poor physical, mental, or social well-being at 3-month follow-up. Although some individuals had clinically meaningful improvements over time, many reported moderate to severe impairments in well-being 3 months later.

"Remote Consultations for Mental Health: Patient Experiences","An exponential implementation of remote mental health care has been observed, but little data is available on experiences and barriers of remote health from a patient's perspective. This study investigated experiences associated with several forms of remote consultations (both telephone and online video) for mental health care during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic with a particular focus on patients' experiences. This study includes results of an online web-based survey filled in by 512 patients on the use and experiences of remote mental health consultations and circulating between March and October 2021. Psychiatric consultations were initiated by the health care provider in 47.0% of cases, while psychological consultations were most often initiated in shared decision with the patient (54.9%). Only 28.8% of participants mentioned advantages regarding teleconsultations over face-to-face, compared to 39.3% for online video consultations. Moreover, 49.3% saw clear disadvantages for teleconsultations and 32.7% for video consultations. Positive factors associated with remote mental health care included when faced with transportation problems, followed by consultations primarily focusing on medication (for telephone consultations) or on more practical aspects (for video consultations). 25.0% of patients deemed conversations when being angry or sad to be feasible by telephone, and 33.0% considered these feasibly using video consultations. Remote consultations were deemed feasible, but the positive factors did not seem to outweigh the face-to-face contacts from a patient's perspective. Remote consultations will probably remain present in the following decades, although care must be taken when providing the possibility of remote mental health care.","Crunelle, Van Daele, Van Laere, Blancke, Vanderbruggen, Matthys","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-022-01175-4","20221202","COVID-19; mental health; patient experience; remote care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42036,""
"Anxiety symptoms among children visiting a pediatric emergency center in Qatar during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Although the evidence base regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children has been growing, descriptions of their experiences remain scarce. In this cross-sectional study, the authors used the Child-Reported Spence Children's Anxiety Scale to collect data from 91 children visiting a pediatric emergency center in Qatar during the pandemic. Around 25% of the children reported elevated levels of overall anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were the most common, with 59.3% of children reporting elevated symptoms. The mean score of physical injury fears was significantly affected by gender, with females having higher scores. Overall rates for elevated anxiety symptoms were similar in natives and expatriate children. The findings suggest that the effects of the pandemic on children may depend on several vulnerability factors, including developmental age and gender. This study highlights the need to plan multidisciplinary strategies to enhance children's access to mental health services during and after the current health crisis.","Khan, Khan, Khoodoruth, Dehwari, Hammoudeh, Al-Amri, Alabdulla","https://doi.org/10.1521/bumc.2022.86.4.283","20221205","COVID-19; adolescents; anxiety; children; pandemic; survey; Female; Child; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Qatar; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42037,""

"Frontline medical professionals in distress - â€œDoctor heal thyselfâ€","Covid has changed our lives in many ways. People are scared to even step out of their houses, but health care workers have no option but to continue to work and care for the sick. Health care workers play a vital role in providing care to the infected persons, working beyond their capacities and risking their own lives. There is a lot of stress involved in the medical profession, and the pandemic made it worse. Each frontline health worker is at risk of getting infected with Covid during work and carrying it to their families, causing a lot of anxiety and mental health issues among the health care workers. According to a recent by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than half of public health workers have reported symptoms of at least one mental health condition like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the recent past. A recent study among 422 doctors revealed 63.5% symptoms of depression, and 45% symptoms of stress, among frontline COVID-19 doctors. Physicians who perceived organizational problems related to procedural and informational justice were exposed to high levels of occupational stress. Every physician should have a personal doctor, and he or she has to seek suitable help as needed. The health care workers' stress is mainly associated with work stress as they are expected to work on a war footing and get very little time to spend with their families. There is a need to set up good psychiatric care for the medical professionals in the hospitals. The administrators of the hospitals should frequently check on the health and well-being of their employees. This article attempts to provide strategies to hospital administrators to help medical professionals reduce their stress levels.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100444","20221201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42039,""

"Measuring Intolerance of Uncertainty after Acquired Brain Injury: Factor Structure, Reliability, and Validity of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12","Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a risk factor for poor mental health. Acquired brain injury (ABI; e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury), often brings considerable uncertainty and increased mood disorder vulnerability. The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12) is a brief, well-validated measure of IU argued to comprise two subscales, Prospective Anxiety and Inhibitory Anxiety. Here, for the first time, we investigated its reliability and validity (N = 118), and factor structure (N = 176), in ABI. Both subscales had high test-retest reliability (ICCs of 0.75 and 0.86) and were significantly associated with mood disorder symptoms. The two-factor model was superior to a one-factor IU model fit. IUS-12 scores were stable despite great uncertainties of COVID-19, consistent with its conceptualisation as a trait. Consistent with recent debates about the factor structure of IUS-12 and, in exploratory analyses, we found indications of improved fits that warrant further investigation in independent ABI samples.","Andrea Kusec et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E014B-058-126","20221205","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Neuropsychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Psychometrics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; neurological impairment; assessment; psychometrics; intolerance of uncertainty; acquired brain injury; mood disorder","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-05","",42042,""
