"[Psychological Distress during the Corona Shutdown: Associations between Behavioral Adaption and Psychological Distress in Individuals with Preexisting Psychiatric Conditions and Healthy Controls]","Current research suggests that individuals with preexisting psychiatric conditions experienced particularly high levels of psychological distress during the various 'shutdown' measures to contain Covid-19. In order to gain a better insight into the demands for psychiatric care in times of crisis, this study compared levels of psychological distress in individuals with preexisting psychiatric conditions with healthy controls and further examined associations of daily routines with psychological distress. Out of 99 participants of an online survey, 44 individuals reported prior mental health-related inpatient treatment. Patients were asked about their levels of psychological distress and adaptation of lifestyle and activities of daily living. Individuals with a psychiatric history were significantly more psychologically distressed (p &lt; 0.001; d = 1.68) and displayed significantly less behavioral adaptation than healthy controls (p = 0.012; d = -0.52) in response to the changed circumstances. The difference in behavioral adaptation accounted for 21Ã¢â‚¬Å % of the difference in psychological distress. In times of crisis, individuals with a psychiatric history require ongoing support from mental health services, in particular those supporting every-day lifestyle in order to better cope with the consequences of a drastically changed environment. ZIEL: Menschen mit psychischen Vorerkrankungen scheinen nach ersten Studienergebnissen aus anderen LÃƒÂ¤ndern durch den Corona-Shutdown im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2020 besonders psychisch belastet gewesen zu sein. Um fÃƒÂ¼r etwaige kÃƒÂ¼nftige Krisen angemessene Versorgungsstrukturen vorhalten zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen, wurde in dieser Studie die psychische Belastung psychisch Vorerkrankter mit der psychisch Gesunder wÃƒÂ¤hrend des Shutdowns verglichen und darÃƒÂ¼ber hinaus der Zusammenhang zwischen Alltagsverhalten und psychischer Belastung untersucht. In einer 15-minÃƒÂ¼tigen Online-Befragung wurden 44 Menschen mit stationÃƒÂ¤ren psychiatrischen Vorbehandlungen und 55 psychisch Gesunde hinsichtlich ihrer generellen psychischen Belastung und der VerÃƒÂ¤nderungen ihres Alltagsverhaltens seit Beginn der EinschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen befragt. Menschen mit psychischen Vorerkrankungen waren insgesamt signifikant stÃƒÂ¤rker psychisch belastet als Gesunde (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0,001; dÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 1,68) und berichteten auch ÃƒÂ¼ber signifikant geringere konstruktive Anpassungen ihres Alltagsverhaltens (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0,012; dÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã¢Ë†â€™0,52) an die verÃƒÂ¤nderte Lebenssituation. 20,6Ã¢â‚¬Å % der hÃƒÂ¶heren psychischen Belastung lieÃƒÅ¸ sich statistisch durch die geringere Anpassung des Alltagsverhaltens erklÃƒÂ¤ren. Die Befunde legen nahe, dass psychisch vorerkrankte Menschen gerade in Krisenzeiten ein differenziertes sozialpsychiatrisches Angebot benÃƒÂ¶tigen, welches sie im Alltag unterstÃƒÂ¼tzt, um notwendige Anpassungen des Alltagslebens an eine dramatisch verÃƒÂ¤nderte Umgebung besser meistern zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen.","Nischk, Voss","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1348-1242","20210215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10731,""
"COVID-19 and how the wearing of face coverings can affect those with an experience of trauma","Following the requirement of face coverings across multiple settings, there has been an emergence of stories around the challenges faced by those with a previous experience of trauma, with their use being a trigger to previous experiences due to their sensory links to previous trauma. Through the sharing of experiences, this paper seeks to provide an understanding of how trauma, in-particular the experience of inter-personal trauma can impact upon the wearing of face coverings, and offers techniques to support their use. Through the introduction of the window of tolerance, and the sharing of first person narratives we provide a means of alleviating the trauma reaction through the application of skills in the form of grounding techniques. To address the limitations of this paper, whilst recognising its importance and ongoing relevance, we recommend that this is an area that would benefit from further research. As the pandemic persists the use of face coverings will continue, making this an important topic for mental health services and practitioners to consider for those accessing services and wider social, occupational and educational settings.","Welfare-Wilson, Adley, Bell, Luby","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12743","20210215","Adult Survivors of Abuse; Anxiety; Domestic Violence; Intimate Partner Violence; Narratives; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10732,""

"Schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a critical impact on healthcare systems across the world, as well as on mental health in the general population; however, evidence regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with schizophrenia and on the onset of psychotic symptoms is currently emerging. People living with schizophrenia are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and present worse COVID-19-related outcomes, including mortality. They show low levels of information and of concern regarding the possibility of contagion and infection but presented substantially stable levels of psychotic symptoms and even increased subjective well being during the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, as well as the prolonged social isolation and the spread of misinformation, appear to be responsible in some cases for the onset of psychotic symptoms. Clinicians should inform and educate their patients on the risks related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 and on the precautions that they should adopt to avoid contagion. Particular attention should be devoted to maintaining the continuity of care, especially in frail patients. Telemedicine might represent a valid support, but face-to-face visits in some cases remain essential. The hypothesis of a direct role of viral infection on the onset of psychotic disorders is currently debated, as viral involvement of central nervous system appears to be rather infrequent in COVID-19.","Barlati, Nibbio, Vita","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000702","20210215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10734,""
"Relatively mild symptoms after chronic overdose with a double-dose encorafenib: a case report","Encorafenib (Braftovi) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, in combination with binimetinib (Mektovi). According to the product label of encorafenib, there are no specific treatment recommendations in case of an overdose. We report on a 63-year-old man who ingested a double dose (900 mg) of encorafenib for 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. He developed overall minor chronic overdose symptoms such as nausea and vomiting grade 1 and muscle pain. Based on the most occurring adverse events of encorafenib, liver values, kidney function parameters and QTc interval were measured. Kidney function parameters were normal, whereas liver values were slightly increased (grade 1) and QTc slightly prolonged. The plasma concentration 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°h after the last dose was 2110Ã¢â‚¬â€°ng/mL. We describe the course of a case with a chronic overdose during 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of the double dose of encorafenib as well as the followed approach, which could be taken into account when observing an encorafenib overdose. Providing information in times of Covid-19 is challenging, but remains necessary for good clinical care.","Mian, Meussen, Piersma, Lankheet","https://doi.org/10.1097/CAD.0000000000001052","20210215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10735,""
"Trends in US Alcohol Consumption Frequency During the First Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created disruptions and stressors which may have influenced alcohol consumption frequency trends. Varying COVID-19 health burden and alcohol policies may have contributed to different consumption trends between states. The aim of this study is to assess trends in alcohol consumption and moderation by state of residence. We examined trends in adult drinking days, during the first wave of the pandemic (March 10 to June 8) using longitudinal data from Understanding America Study (N=6,172 unique participants; N=28,059 observations). Because state mandates were responsive to disease burden, we modelled interaction by COVID-19 burden, defined as if the state had the median (or higher) daily incidence of COVID-19 cases on the survey date, and state random effects. We controlled for individual sociodemographics, perceived personal/familial COVID-19 burden, mental health symptomology, and risk avoidance. Drinking days increased throughout the duration (incidence risk ratio [IRR] for drinking per increase in one calendar day = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001, 1.004); trends were heterogeneous by disease burden, with individuals living in states with lower COVID-19 burden increasing (IRR=1.005, 95% CI 1.003, 1.007) faster relative to those living in states with higher COVID-19 burden (IRR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998, 1.002). Trends were heterogenous between states, but there was no evidence of systematic geographic clustering of state trends. Drinking days increased during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among residents of states with lower disease burden.","McKetta, Morrison, Keyes","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14575","20210215","Alcohol; SARS-CoV-2; trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10736,""
"Psychosocial predictors of virus and social distancing fears in undergraduate students living in a US COVID-19 &quot;hotspot&quot;","The COVID-19 pandemic is positioned to exact a substantial mental health toll on the global population. Heightened fears of viral contamination and fears of the negative consequences of social distancing (e.g., fears related to home confinement, fears of loneliness and isolation) might contribute to the distress caused by the pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected from undergraduates (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 608) residing in a U.S. pandemic &quot;hotspot&quot; at the time of data collection (between 7 April to 9 May, 2020). Outcome variables included viral contamination fears and social distancing fears. Predictor variables included biological sex, underlying medical vulnerability, number of recent viral symptoms, presence of positive COVID-19 test in social network, anxiety, depression, stress, emotion dysregulation, intolerance of uncertainty, body vigilance, and health anxiety. Female sex, anxiety severity, intolerance of uncertainty, and health anxiety uniquely predicted fears of viral contamination. Female sex and depression severity uniquely predicted fears of social distancing. Multiple anxiety-related vulnerabilities are potential intervention targets for reducing viral contamination fears. Depression is a potential intervention target for social distancing fears. Females might be at greater risk for both types of fears.","Fedorenko, Kibbey, Contrada, Farris","https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2020.1866658","20210215","COVID-19; health anxiety; social distancing; virus fears","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10737,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with HIV in Victoria, Australia","As of 12th January 2021, Australia has reported 28,634 COVID-19 cases. Most (20,411) cases are from the state of Victoria. In response to rising infections and community transmission in July 2020, on 2nd August several restrictions were imposed for the following 111 days, including an 8pm curfew, a travel restriction to 5km from home, and closure of non-essential services. It is unknown how this affected people living with HIV (PLHIV), who already experience disproportionate levels of mental health issues, comorbidity and stigma. An online survey was designed with HIV community-based organisations to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Victorian PLHIV. Participants were recruited voluntarily both through social media and Infectious Diseases clinics at participating hospitals. There were 153 respondents. Most were male (77%), aged between 30 and 60 years (77%), and Australian-born (63%). Forty-three percent, 31%, and 25% reported negative impacts upon personal relationships, employment, and income, respectively. HIV care continued with 95% and 98% being able to access their HIV provider and antiretroviral therapy (ART), respectively. Telehealth was used by 92% and was largely well received. PLHIV reported worry about physical health (68%), mental health (66%), finances (50%) and accommodation (25%). Fifty percent of participants reported weight gain and 27% increased alcohol intake. This study demonstrated the widespread negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PLHIV in Victoria, although provision of HIV care and ART continued uninterrupted. This highlighted the importance of mental health support and social welfare programs during times of healthcare and societal strain.","Weerasuria, Ko, Ehm, O'Bryan, McMahon, Woolley, Hoy, Lau","https://doi.org/10.1089/AID.2021.0007","20210215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10738,""
"The mediating role of regulatory emotional self-efficacy on negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Nurses exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are psychologically stressed. This study examines the characteristics and distribution of negative emotions among Chinese nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores regulatory emotional self-efficacy (RESE) as the underlying mechanism in the relationship between nurses' personalities and negative emotions. A cross-sectional design with convenience sampling was utilized. Three comprehensive tertiary hospitals located in China were selected. Nurses (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 339) who cared for COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Recruitment was conducted between 14 February 2020 and 1 March 2020. Self-reported questionnaires about personality, RESE, and epidemic-related negative emotions were completed online. A correlation analysis, structural equation modelling, and the bootstrapping method were used to analyse the data. This study identified a 24.9% incidence of negative emotions in nurses. RESE was a significant mediator explaining the effect of personality on epidemic-related negative emotions. RESE mediated the effect of introversion-extroversion on depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.151, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.015), neuroticism (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.182, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.007), fear (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.142, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.006), anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.189, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.015), and hypochondria (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.118, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.010); it also mediated the effect of neuroticism on depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.313, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002), neuroticism (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.394, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003), fear (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.345, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005), anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.384, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003), and hypochondria (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.259, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004). Nurses caring for COVID-19 patients displayed negative emotions, particularly emotionally unstable and introverted nurses with a low RESE level. RESE is often essential for interventions because it significantly influences the relationship between personality and negative emotions. In the event of a major outbreak, tailored psychological well-being education, which includes emotional self-efficacy strategies, should be provided by organizations to help nurses manage stress related to the outbreak.","Sui, Gong, Zhuang","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12830","20210215","COVID-19; mediating effect; negative emotion; personality; regulatory emotional self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10739,""
"Work environment of hospital nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","To investigate the nurses' work environment in university hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic brought challenging times for nurses worldwide. In Brazil, as well as in several countries, nurses are working hard in hospital settings caring for patients infected with the virus, sometimes with unfavourable work environment conditions. This study was a convergent embedded mixed methods research. The sample comprised 104Ã‚Â nurses from three Brazilian university hospitals. Data were collected in April-JuneÃ‚Â 2020 from an online questionnaire with a self-reporting Likert scale survey designed to measure the nurses' perceptions of their work environment. Qualitative data in the form of written comments were also collected through an open question. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. The quantitative results showed that the responses to 'I received training on the correct use of personal protective equipment' and 'I am afraid of being infected' items had the best and worst evaluations, respectively. The qualitative findings revealed five themes: feeling of insecurity, lack of personal protective equipment, lack of diagnostic tests, changes in the care flow and fear of the unknown. The study has highlighted the challenges faced by hospital nurses while caring for patients with COVID-19. The gaps identified will assist the policymakers and hospital managers in developing policies to enhance the support offered to nurses and improve the care provided to patients with COVID-19 in university hospitals. The results also indicate the need for attention to the mental health of the professionals due to the increasing workload and treatment of an illness hitherto unknown.","Santos, Balsanelli, Freitas, Menegon, Carneiro, Lazzari, Menezes, Erdmann, Camponogara","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12662","20210215","coronavirus infections; hospitals; nurse's role; organization and administration; pandemics; university; work environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10740,""

"Support from friends moderates the relationship between repetitive negative thinking and postnatal wellbeing during COVID-19","<b>Background</b>: Increasing evidence has linked repetitive negative thinking (RNT) to postnatal depression and anxiety, yet the factors moderating this relationship have been minimally investigated. During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, social restrictions imposed to reduce viral transmission limited access to social support, which is critical to postnatal psychological wellbeing -Ã‚Â potentially intensifying RNT. <b>Objective</b>: We examined whether perceived social support (from friends, family, and a significant other) played a moderating role in the relationship between RNT and maternal postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms. <b>Methods</b>: A sample of women (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 251) who had given birth in the preceding 12Ã‚Â months completed an online battery of standardised measures during the COVID-19 'lockdown' of May 2020. <b>Results</b>: As predicted, social support moderated the relationship between RNT and depression such that the association between RNT and depression was stronger for women who reported lower levels of social support. Interestingly, this finding emerged for social support from friends only; for support from family and significant other, social support did not play a moderating role. Further, and unexpectedly, overall social support did not moderate the relationship between RNT and postnatal anxiety, however, social support from friends was a significant moderator. <b>Conclusions</b>: High levels of perceived social support from friends (but not family or significant others) buffered the effects of RNT on depression and anxiety during the postpartum period. Strategies to bolster peer social support may be a valuable inclusion in interventions to prevent and treat postnatal depression and anxiety.","Harrison, Moulds, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1080/02646838.2021.1886260","20210215","Postnatal depression; postnatal anxiety; repetitive negative thinking; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10742,""
"COVID-19 is viewed as severe as tumor and HIV; perceptions towards COVID-19","Since its first emergence, people have been having different attitudes and perceptions towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceptions (e.g. perception of disease threat) have profound consequences on behavior (e.g medication adherence). If adequately available, perception studies guide public awareness efforts or help in understanding behavior. In this study , repeated cross-sectional data wereÃ‚Â collected from 376 randomly selected globally located respondents over two periods. Participants perceived COVID-19 as severe as Tumor and AIDS (F (2,722)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.347; p =Ã‚Â .096), and as more severe than other 14 illnesses; e.g. Diabetes and High blood pressure.

"Supporting nurses' recovery during and following the COVID-19 pandemic","Research suggests that working during traumatic events can lead to deteriorating physical and mental health for nurses, a phenomenon that has been demonstrated during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, research has also shown that there are evidence-based strategies that can be used to assist nurses in their recovery from such events. Promoting awareness among individual nurses about the effects of COVID-19 enables them to adopt positive coping strategies, both on an individual and organisational level. This article details strategies including formal and informal debriefing, taking regular breaks, and using stress mitigation strategies during shifts. The article also discusses the potential for post-traumatic psychological growth. This acknowledges that while working in a healthcare environment during COVID-19 can be extremely challenging, it also enables nurses to experience personal growth such as the development of emotional intelligence. As nurses adapt to the 'new normal' of working during COVID-19, healthcare organisations should ensure that they provide nurses with the support that enables them to recover effectively.","Jackson","https://doi.org/10.7748/ns.2021.e11661","20210215","COVID-19; mental health; nurses; nursesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ well-being; professional; professional issues; recovery; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10744,""
"Emergency Department presentations in the Southern District of New Zealand during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown","To assess changes in presentations to Emergency Departments (EDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Southern Region of New Zealand.

"Mesenchymal stromal cell immunomodulation: In pursuit of controlling COVID-19 related cytokine storm","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has grown to be a global public health crisis with no safe and effective treatments available yet. Recent findings suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus pathogen that causes COVID-19, could elicit a cytokine storm that drives edema, dysfunction of the airway exchange, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the lung, followed by acute cardiac injury and thromboembolic events leading to multiorgan failure and death. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), owing to their powerful immunomodulatory abilities, have the potential to attenuate the cytokine storm and have therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for which several clinical trials are underway. Given that intravenous infusion of MSCs results in a significant trapping in the lung, MSC therapy could directly mitigate inflammation, protect alveolar epithelial cells, and reverse lung dysfunction by normalizing the pulmonary microenvironment and preventing pulmonary fibrosis.

"Advanced Nanomaterials for Preparedness Against (Re-)Emerging Viral Diseases","While the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) accounts for the current global pandemic, the emergence of other unknown pathogens, named &quot;Disease X,&quot; remains a serious concern in the future. Emerging or re-emerging pathogens continue to pose significant challenges to global public health. In response, the scientific community has been urged to create advanced platform technologies to meet the ever-increasing needs presented by these devastating diseases with pandemic potential. This review aims to bring new insights to allow for the application of advanced nanomaterials in future diagnostics, vaccines, and antiviral therapies, thereby addressing the challenges associated with the current preparedness strategies in clinical settings against viruses. The application of nanomaterials has advanced medicine and provided cutting-edge solutions for unmet needs. Herein, an overview of the currently available nanotechnologies is presented, highlighting the significant features that enable them to control infectious diseases, and identifying the challenges that remain to be addressed for the commercial production of nano-based products is presented. Finally, to conclude, the development of a nanomaterial-based system using a &quot;One Health&quot; approach is suggested. This strategy would require a transdisciplinary collaboration and communication between all stakeholders throughout the entire process spanning across research and development, as well as the preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing phases.","Kim, Lim, Park, Park, Lim, Lee, Na, Yeom, Kim, Song, Haam","https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202005927","20210215","antiviral therapeutics; diagnostic tools; emerging viral diseases; nanomaterials; nanovaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10747,""
"Rapid, Full-Scale Change to Virtual PCIT During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implementation and Clinical Implications","Health agencies call for the immediate mobilization of existing interventions in response to numerous child and family mental health concerns that have arisen as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Answering this call, this pilot study describes the rapid, full-scale change from a primarily clinic-based Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) model to a virtual service model (i.e., I-PCIT) in an academic and community-based program in Miami, Florida. First, we describe the virtual service training model our program developed and its implementation with 17 therapists (M<sub>Age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32.35, 88.2% female, 47.1% Hispanic) to enable our clinic to shift from providing virtual services to a small portion of the families served (29.1%) to all of the families served. Second, we examine the effect of I-PCIT on child and caregiver outcomes during the 2-month stay-at-home period between March 16, 2020, and May 16, 2020, in 86 families (M<sub>ChildAge</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.75, 71% Hispanic). Due to the rapid nature of the current study, all active participants were transferred to virtual services, and therefore there was no comparison or control group, and outcomes represent the most recently available scores and not treatment completion. Results reveal that I-PCIT reduced child externalizing and internalizing problems and caregiver stress, and increased parenting skills and child compliance with medium to large effects even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the study examined components of our virtual service training model associated with the greatest improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Preliminary findings revealed that locally and collaboratively developed strategies (e.g., online communities of practice, training videos and guides) had the strongest association with child and caregiver outcomes. Implications for virtual service delivery, implementation, and practice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Garcia, Blizzard, Peskin, Rothenberg, Schmidt, Piscitello, Espinosa, Salem, Rodriguez, Sherman, Parlade, Landa, Davis, Weinstein, Garcia, Perez, Rivera, Martinez, Jent","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-021-01211-0","20210215","COVID-19; Implementation; Parent child interaction therapy; Virtual services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10748,""

This study surveyed community college students (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°356) about their confidence in completing learning related tasks before and after the shift, access to technologies used in in remote learning, and disruptions that impacted their learning. Results indicated notable declines in confidence across all demographics with significant changes in those age 18-21and for those without prior online course experience. Technology use for remote courses was primarily laptops and smartphones. Students reported the most significant changes to work-life balance came through employment changes and mental health issues. Instructional changes were both positive and negative in workload organization, course delivery, communication and technology.

"Therapists Make the Switch to Telepsychology to Safely Continue Treating Their Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic Virtual Reality Telepsychology May Be Next","Before COVID-19, most therapists had concerns about telepsychology, and only treated patients in person. During the COVID-19 lockdown, patients still needed therapy, but in-person therapy sessions became unsafe. The current study measured how many therapists are using online therapy before vs. during COVID-19, how much training they have received, and their knowledge about legal restrictions on using telepsychology. A sample of 768 U.S.A. mental health professionals completed a 29-item online survey. Results show that before COVID-19, most therapists only saw their patients in person (e.g., at the therapists office), but during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all therapists used a wide range of telecommunication technologies to communicate with their quarantined patients, including texting, telephones, video conferences, and even virtual reality. According to within-subject related samples comparisons, 39% of survey respondents used telepsychology before COVID-19, vs. 98% during COVID-19 (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 450.02, <i>p</i>&lt; 0.001). Therapists reported high treatment effectiveness using telepsychology (7.45 on 0-10 scale). However, overall, on a 0-10 scale, therapists reported a significant increase in feeling burned out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mean = 3.93 (SD = 1.93) before vs. 6.22 (SD = 2.27) during the pandemic (<i>Z</i> = -18.57, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Although the APA ethics guidelines encourage therapists to use telepsychology with their patients during the crisis, gaps in respondents' knowledge identify a need for increased specialized training and education. Although the current study showed that virtual reality is rarely used by the therapists surveyed, virtual reality is a promising new telepsychology technology. Billions of dollars are currently being invested in mass producing immersive virtual reality systems. In the future, as networked immersive Virtual Reality becomes more widely available, therapists and patients in physically different locations will be able to &quot;meet&quot; in a shared computer-generated world designed for therapy sessions, potentially including group sessions. Telepsychology and virtual reality have the potential to be increasingly valuable tools to help therapists mitigate the consequences of COVID-19. Research, development and training is recommended.","Sampaio, Haro, De Sousa, Melo, Hoffman","https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2020.576421","20210215","COVID-19; anxiety; burnoutÃ¢â‚¬â€œprofessional; mental health; psychology; stress; telepsychology; virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10750,""
"The use of electrocardiogram screening to clear athletes for return to sport following COVID-19 infection","To quantify the occurrence rate of abnormal ECG findings and symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Adult patients (&gt;18 years old) who were participating in collegiate athletics and previously tested positive for COVID-19 between August 2020 to November 2020. In this retrospective study, we report findings of electrocardiogram (ECG) testing to screen athletes for cardiac abnormalities following COVID-19. Athletes underwent general examinations and ECG screening prior to being medically cleared for a return to sport following COVID-19. Predetermined predictors were grouped into categorical variables including: 1) Sex; 2) Symptom severity; and 3) BMI (normal vs. overweight = &gt; 24 kgÃ¢Ë†â„¢m<sup>-2</sup>). These were used to examine differences of abnormal rates occurred between different predictor categories. Of the 170 athletes screened, 6 (3.5%) presented with abnormal ECG criteria and were referred to cardiology. We found no evidence that symptom severity, sex and BMI category were associated with a higher rate of abnormal ECG (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Greater severity of COVID-19 symptoms were associated with higher percentage of ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes and presence of fQRS. Loss of smell, loss of taste, headache and sore throat were the most prevalent symptoms with 32.9%, 38.8%, 36.5% and 25.3% of athletes reporting each symptom, respectively. Preliminary findings indicate a low risk of myocardial injury secondary to COVID-19 infection with less than4% of patients presenting with abnormal ECG and 10% requiring referral to a cardiologist.

"Associations Between Change in Outside Time Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Public Health Restrictions and Mental Health: Brief Research Report","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated pandemic has resulted in systemic changes to much of life, affecting both physical and mental health. Time spent outside is associated with positive mental health; however, opportunities to be outside were likely affected by the COVID-19 public health restrictions that encouraged people not to leave their homes unless it was required. This study investigated the impact of acute COVID-19 public health restrictions on outside time in April 2020, and quantified the association between outside time and both stress and positive mental health, using secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the COVID and Well-being Study. Participants (<i>n</i> = 3,291) reported demographics, health behaviors, amount of time they spent outside pre/post COVID-19 public health restrictions (categorized as increased, maintained, or decreased), current stress (Perceived Stress Scale-4), and positive mental health (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). Outside time was lower following COVID-19 restrictions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; Cohen's <i>d</i> = -0.19). Participants who increased or maintained outside time following COVID-19 restrictions reported lower stress (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, 5.93 [5.74-6.12], Hedges' <i>g</i> = -0.18; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, mean = 5.85 [5.67-6.02], Hedges' <i>g</i> = -0.21; respectively) and higher positive mental health (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, 24.49 [24.20-24.77], Hedges' <i>g</i> = 0.21; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, 24.78 [24.52-25.03], Hedges' <i>g</i> = 0.28) compared to those who decreased outside time.

"Social Distancing: Prevalence of Depressive, Anxiety, and Stress Symptoms Among Brazilian Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic can impact mental health, triggering symptoms such as anxiety, stress and depression. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the period of social distancing due to COVID-19 in students from a campus of the Federal Institute in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre/RS. A correlational and exploratory study was performed. The sample of the present research was composed by 208 students, who responded to a self-administered online questionnaire with sociodemographic variables and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale Short Form - DASS-21. The detected prevalence of symptoms classified as moderate-severe was 49% for stress, 39% for depression and 33% for anxiety. An association was found between higher levels of anxiety symptoms (OR = 5.652; 95% CI = 2.872-11.123; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), depression (OR = 3.289; 95% CI = 1.810-5.978; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and stress (OR = 5.684; 95% CI = 3.120-10.355; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) with occurrence of sleep problems during the period of social distancing. There was a protective factor provided by regular physical exercise in relation to depressive symptoms (OR = 0.490; 95% CI = 0.250-0.960; <i>p</i> =0.033).

"Characteristics of effective online interventions: implications for adolescents with personality disorder during a global pandemic","In recent years, the necessity of providing online interventions for adolescents, as an alternative to face-to-face interventions, has become apparent due to several barriers some adolescents face in accessing treatment. This need has become more critical with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic impacting the delivery of psychotherapy and limiting accessibility of face-to-face therapy. Whilst it has been established that face-to-face psychotherapy for adolescents with personality disorder can be effective in reducing the impact these complex mental illnesses have on functioning, online interventions for adolescents are rare, and to our knowledge there are no empirically validated online interventions for personality disorder. The development of novel online interventions are therefore necessary. To inform the development of online interventions for adolescents with personality disorder or symptoms of emerging personality disorder, a two-phase rapid review was conducted. Phase one consisted of a search and examination of existing online mental health programs for adolescents with symptoms of personality disorder, to understand how to best use online platforms. Phase two consisted of a rapid review of empirical literature examining online interventions for adolescents experiencing symptoms of personality disorder to identify characteristics that promote efficacy. There were no online programs specific to personality disorder in adolescence. However, 32 online mental health programs and 41 published empirical studies were included for analysis. Common intervention characteristics included timeframes of one to two months, regular confidential therapist contact, simple interactive online components and modules, and the inclusion of homework or workbook activities to practice new skills. There is an urgent need for online interventions targeting personality dysfunction in adolescence. Several characteristics of effective online interventions for adolescents were identified. These characteristics can help inform the development and implementation of novel online treatments to prevent and reduce the burden and impact of personality disorder, or symptoms of emerging personality disorder, in adolescents. This has implications for the COVID-19 pandemic when access to effective online interventions has become more urgent.","Reis, Matthews, Grenyer","https://doi.org/10.4081/ripppo.2020.488","20210215","Adolescents; COVID-19; online intervention; personality disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10754,""
"Case Report: Myopathy in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Consequence of Hyperinflammation?","<b>Introduction:</b> COVID-19-associated muscular complications may comprise myalgia, weakness, wasting, and rhabdomyolysis. Skeletal muscle damage in COVID-19 may be due to direct infection by the virus SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, systemic hyper-inflammatory state with cytokine release and homeostatic perturbation, an autoimmune process, or myotoxic drugs. Disclosing the cause of weakness in an individual patient is therefore difficult. <b>Case Description:</b> We report two patients, who survived typical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment and who developed early on myalgia and severe proximal weakness in all four limbs. Laboratory exams revealed elevated serum creatine kinase and markedly increased C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, concurring with a systemic inflammatory response. On admission in neurorehabilitation (4 and 7 weeks after COVID-19 onset, respectively), the patients presented with proximal flaccid tetraparesis and limb-girdle muscle atrophy. Motor nerve conduction studies showed decreased amplitude and prolonged duration of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with normal distal motor latencies and normal conduction velocities in median and ulnar nerves. Needle electromyography in proximal muscles revealed spontaneous activity in one and myopathic changes in both patients. <b>Discussion:</b> Clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic findings in these patients were unequivocally consistent with myopathy. Interestingly, increased distal CMAP duration has been described in patients with critical illness myopathy (CIM) and reflects slow muscle fiber conduction velocity due to membrane hypo-excitability, possibly induced by inflammatory cytokines. By analogy with CIM, the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related myopathy might also depend on hyperinflammation and metabolic pathways that may affect muscles in a pathophysiological continuum from hypo-excitability to necrosis.","Versace, Sebastianelli, Ferrazzoli, Saltuari, Kofler, LÃƒÂ¶scher, Uncini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.625144","20210215","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; compound muscle action potential duration; critical illness myopathy; interleukin 6","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10755,""
"COVID-19 and Pretentious Psychological Well-Being of Students: A Threat to Educational Sustainability","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, reaction quarantine, social distancing, and economic crises have posed a greater risk to physical and psychological health. Such derogatory mental health stigma is associated with adverse outcomes in the student population. The purpose of the current study is to provide a timely evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects on students' psychological well-being to sustain economic sustainability. A thorough review of the literature and current studies, significant emphasis of socio-demographic indicators, interpretation of physical symptoms, home quarantine activities, and COVID-19 unique stressors were extracted. Data were collected through electronic surveys from 640 university students at local and foreign universities. The findings revealed substantial adverse effects resulting in varying levels of stress, symptoms of depression, and specific discomfort in the case. Among COVID-19 stressors, financial instability, unpredictability toward future/career, and media exposure have been described as common factors that cause poor psychological well-being and weaken economic sustainability. COVID-19, quarantine, self-isolation, and onerous interventions primarily weaken university students' mental health. The emphasis on this vulnerable category, however, is substantially absent from the literature.

"Athletes' Psychological Adaptation to Confinement Due to COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study","Studies of individuals under conditions of confinement or severe social and physical restrictions have consistently shown deleterious mental health effects but also high levels of adaptability when dealing with such conditions. Considering the role of physical activity and sport in psychological adaptation, this paper describes a longitudinal study to explore to what extent the imposed restrictions due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 may have affected athletes' mental health outcomes and how far the process of adaptation to confinement conditions is differentially affected depending on whether the sports activity was practiced individually or in a group, and outdoors, indoors, or both. Two hundred and seventy-four athletes were assessed over 7 weeks using the GHQ-28 and an <i>ad hoc</i> survey exploring the practice of physical activity. A mixed-model fixed effects ANCOVA was used to analyze the effects of time, place, and company in which the sport was practiced, with an index of the amount of physical activity expended as a covariate. Results show a significant effect of time in three out of four of the GHQ-28 subscales, in all cases showing a consistent adaptation to conditions over time. Results also show that playing sport indoors, outdoors, or both, and practicing alone vs. with others differentially affect the somatic symptoms exhibited during confinement: Athletes who practiced sport with others showed higher levels of somatic symptoms at the beginning of the set of data but a quicker rate of adaptation. Differences arising from practicing sport alone or with others were more pronounced in the case of indoor sports, which could be related to the fact that physical activity that can be practiced during confinement is more similar to that practiced indoors alone. Implications relating to what sport psychologists and other health professionals may offer to athletes in stressful situations are discussed.","Rubio, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Iglesias, Bueno, Martin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.613495","20210215","COVID-19; confinement; mental health; physical activity; psychological adaptation; sport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10757,""

"Mental Distress and Its Contributing Factors Among Young People During the First Wave of COVID-19: A Belgian Survey Study","<b>Background:</b> The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and its associated measures led to high levels of mental distress in the general population. Previous research indicated that young people are especially vulnerable for a wide range of mental health problems during the pandemic, but little is known about the mechanisms. This study examined mental distress and its contributing factors among young Belgian people. <b>Methods:</b> An online survey was widely distributed in Belgium during the first wave of COVID-19 in March, and 16-25-year-olds were selected as a subsample. Mental distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and a threshold of Ã¢â€°Â¥4 was used to discriminate mental distress cases from non-cases. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate possible predictors of mental distress, including demographics, chronic condition, history of mental health problems, social support, exposure to COVID-19, and several changes in everyday activities. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,008 respondents were included, of which the majority was female (78.09%) and student (66.82%). The results indicate that about two thirds (65.49%) experienced mental distress. In the multivariable regression model, significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) predictors of mental distress were female gender (OR = 1.78), low social support (OR = 2.17), loneliness (OR = 5.17), a small (OR = 1.63), or large (OR = 3.08) increase in social media use, a small (OR = 1.63) or large (OR = 2.17) decrease in going out for drinks or food, and a decrease in doing home activities (OR = 2.72). <b>Conclusion:</b> Young people experience high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that mental distress was highest among women, those experiencing loneliness or low social support and those whose usual everyday life is most affected.

"Factors Associated With Psychological Distress in Health-Care Workers During an Infectious Disease Outbreak: A Rapid Systematic Review of the Evidence","<b>Objective:</b> Health-care workers (HCW) are at risk for psychological distress during an infectious disease outbreak, such as the coronavirus pandemic, due to the demands of dealing with a public health emergency. This rapid systematic review examined the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak. <b>Method:</b> We systematically reviewed literature on the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, and Ebola). Four electronic databases were searched (2000 to 15 November 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research according to a pre-registered protocol. A narrative synthesis was conducted to identify fixed, modifiable, and infection-related factors linked to distress and psychiatric morbidity. <b>Results:</b> From the 4,621 records identified, 138 with data from 143,246 HCW in 139 studies were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. The majority of the studies were conducted during COVID-19 (<i>k</i> = 107, <i>N</i> = 34,334) and SARS (<i>k</i> = 21, <i>N</i> = 18,096). Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk of contact with infected patients, and experiencing quarantine, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organizational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training, and resources, were associated with less psychological distress. <b>Conclusions:</b> This review highlights the key factors to the identify HCW who are most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak and modifying factors to reduce distress and improve resilience. Recommendations are that HCW at risk for increased distress receive early interventions and ongoing monitoring because there is evidence that HCW distress can persist for up to 3 years after an outbreak. Further research needs to track the associations of risk and resilience factors with distress over time and the extent to which certain factors are inter-related and contribute to sustained or transient distress.","Sirois, Owens","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589545","20210215","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health-care workers; psychological distress; resilience; risk factors; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10760,""
"Perceived Stress, Hope, and Health Outcomes Among Medical Staff in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study investigated the buffering role of hope between perceived stress and health outcomes among front-line medical staff treating patients with suspected COVID-19 infection in Shenzhen, China. In the cross-sectional study with online questionnaires, medical staff's perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and hope were measured by the 10-item Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Locus-of-Hope Scale, respectively. A total of 319 eligible front-line medical staff participated. The prevalence of anxiety (29.70%), depression (28.80%), poor sleep quality (38.90%) indicated that a considerable proportion of medical staff experienced mood and sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internal locus-of-hope significantly moderated the effects of stress on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. Moreover, external family locus-of-hope and external peer locus-of-hope significantly moderated the association between perceived stress and depression. The prevalence of symptoms indicates that both mental and physical health outcomes of front-line medical staff deserve more attention.

"Demand Analysis of a Psychiatric Emergency Room and an Adolescent Acute Inpatient Unit in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Madrid, Spain","<b>Introduction:</b> COVID-19 represents a serious threat to mental health worldwide. The aim of this study is to identify changes in adolescent psychiatry treatment demand in a tertiary hospital in Madrid during the first month (March 11 to April 11) after the pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO). We hypothesized that fear of contagion within COVID-19 may deter people from asking for psychiatric care. <b>Method:</b> The current study is retrospective, observational, and transversal. We reviewed the clinical records of 89 adolescents who went to the Emergency Room (ER) or were hospitalized at the Acute Inpatient Unit (AIU) at the Puerta de Hierro University Hospital-Majadahonda (PHUH-M) between March 11 and April 11. Socio-demographic, clinical, and demand variables were included in the study. Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were performed to compare categorical variables. We used the U Mann-Whitney test to compare quantitative variables. The level of statistical significance was set at p&lt; 0.05. Analyses were conducted using SPSS v11.0. <b>Results:</b> The number of adolescents demanding psychiatric care at the ER dropped from 64 adolescents in 2019 to 25 in 2020. Similarly, psychiatric demand collapsed from 31 to 18 patients when comparing 2019 and 2020. Furthermore, the average hospital stay in 2020 trended toward a decrease when compared to 2019 (8.94 Ã‚Â± 4.87 vs. 14.32 Ã‚Â±10.23, <i>p</i> = 0.08). Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors were the most predominant reasons for consultation at both ER and AIU. <b>Conclusion:</b> The demand for adolescent psychiatric care decreased in the first month after the declaration of the pandemic. Our findings may be explained by (1) the fear of contagion, (2) the strict confinement measures, and (3) the initial shock as an adaptive reaction described in other disasters. Further studies are needed.","DÃƒÂ­az de Neira, Blasco-Fontecilla, GarcÃƒÂ­a Murillo, PÃƒÂ©rez-Balaguer, Mallol, Forti, Del Sol, Palanca","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.557508","20210215","COVID-19; acute inpatient unit; adolescent; emergency room; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10762,""
"[Emotional state of school and university teachers in northern Spain in the face of COVID-19]","Since the start of non face-to-face learning classes in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have been accumulating stress. Since then, the teaching staff have had to adapt to the new telematic classes, and in September 2020 they have had to return to face-to-face classes, taking different hygiene measures to prevent contagion. The changes in teaching methods and the lack of guidelines for the new teaching challenges have created a lot of uncertainty in this sector. The aim of the present study was to measure the levels of stress, anxiety and depression of teaching staff in the face of the reopening of schools and universities after 6 months of absence from face-to-face classes. A total of 1,633 teachers from the Department of Education of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) took part, all of them professionals working in different educational centres, from early childhood education to university studies. The questionnaire, DASS-21, was applied to measure the symptomatology presented by the teaching staff in relation to the reopening of the centres. The results show that 32.2% of the participants had symptoms of depression, 49.4% had symptoms of anxiety and 50.6% had symptoms of stress. The results show that teachers have symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. Therefore, it is important to take care of the mental health of teachers in order to take care of the mental health of students and the quality of teaching.

"The Impact of Positive Youth Development Attributes on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Chinese Adolescents Under COVID-19","This study examined the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among adolescents in mainland China under COVID-19. The direct effects of the perceived threat of COVID-19 and positive youth development (PYD) qualities, as well as the moderating effect of PYD qualities on PTSD symptoms, were studied. Five schools in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, participated in this study. Two waves of data were collected before school lockdown (Wave 1, between December 2019 and January 2020) and after school resumption (Wave 2, between June 2020 and July 2020), respectively. A total of 4,981 adolescents aged above 11Ã‚Â years (Mean ageÃ‚Â = 13.15, SDÃ‚Â = 1.32 at Wave 1, 51.5% girls) completed questionnaires at both waves. Students responded to measures of PYD qualities at both waves and perceived threat and PTSD symptoms at WaveÃ‚Â 2. A total of 517 adolescents (10.4%) could be regarded as having PTSD. Results indicated significant unique main effects of perceived threat (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â = .13, p &lt; .001) and Wave 1 PYD qualities (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -.16, p &lt; .001) on PTSD symptoms. Besides, results showed a significant moderating effect of PYD qualities in mitigating the negative impact of perceived threat on PTSD symptoms. This study revealed the protective effect of PYD attributes in reducing the negative influence of traumatic situations such as COVID-19 on adolescent mental health. Results underscore the importance of promoting PYD qualities in adolescents in mainland China via effective PYD programs.","Shek, Zhao, Dou, Zhu, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.011","20210215","Adolescents; COVID-19; China; PTSD; Perceived threat; Positive youth development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10764,""

This study examined trends in the uptake of telehealth items for mental health during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic using administrative Medicare data. During the peak of the pandemic there was a 50% reduction in the in-person consultations for mental health but also a substantial increase in uptake largely of the newly introduced temporary Medicare Benefits Schedule telehealth services. Further, the use of telehealth varied across age, gender and state/territory. These findings have important implications for the allocation of resources for telehealth, both now, and into the post-COVID-19 era.","Jayawardana, Jayawardana, Gannon, Gannon","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH20325","20210215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10765,""
"Development of severe psychological distress among low-income individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic: longitudinal study","It has been indicated that the health impact of COVID-19 is potentially greater in individuals from lower socioeconomic status than in the overall population. To examine how the spread of COVID-19 has altered the general public's mental health, and whether such changes differ in relation to individual income. An online longitudinal survey was conducted at three different time periods during the pandemic. We recruited 1993 people aged 20-70 years, living in the Tokyo metropolitan area in Japan. Participants' mental health was measured with the six-item version of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; the existence of severe psychological distress was ascertained through the cut-off data. Multiple logistic and mixed-model ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed, with income as the independent variable. Of the participants, 985 were male, with a mean age of 50.5 (Ã‚Â±15.8) years. Severe psychological distress percentages for each tested period were 9.3%, 11.2% and 10.7% for phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Between phases 1 and 2 or phases 2 and 3, the group that earned &lt;Ã‚Â£15 000 had significantly higher propensity to develop severe psychological distress than the group that earned Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â£45 000 (odds ratio 2.09, 95% CI 0.95-4.56 between phases 1 and 2; odds ratio 3.00, 95% CI 1.01-9.58 between phases 2 and 3). Although there has been significant deterioration in mental health among citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, this was more significant among those with lower income. Therefore, mental health measures that focus on low socioeconomic groups may be necessary.","Kikuchi, Machida, Nakamura, Saito, Odagiri, Kojima, Watanabe, Inoue","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.5","20210215","Novel coronavirus; general population; inequality; mental health; socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10766,""
"Factors associated with mental health outcomes among medical residents exposed to COVID-19","The COVID-19 outbreak has caused challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. Recent data indicates that the psychological impact has differed with respect to occupation. In many countries, medical residents have been on the front line of this pandemic. However, data on the psychological impact of infectious disease outbreaks, and COVID-19 in particular, on medical residents are relatively lacking. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical residents working on the front and second line. An electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items. Professional quality of life was measured by the Professional Quality of Life measure. Of the 640 medical residents contacted, 127 (20%) responded. A considerable proportion of residents reported symptoms of depression (42.5%), anxiety (41.7%) and stress (30.7%). Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant effects of seniority in residency, with junior residents having poorer outcomes. In addition, there was a statistically significant interaction effect with moderate effect sizes between gender and working on the front line, as well as gender, working on the front line and seniority, on mental health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on junior residents' mental health. Preventive measures to reduce stress levels and easy access to professional mental health services are crucial.","Khoodoruth, Al-Nuaimi, Al-Salihy, Ghaffar, Khoodoruth, Ouanes","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.12","20210215","COVID-19; Mental health; healthcare workers; medical residents; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10767,""

"Acute-onset delirium in intensive care COVID patients: association of imperfect brain repair with foodborne micro-pollutants","COVID-19 affects the brain in various ways, among which delirium is worrying. We assessed whether a specific, long-lasting, COVID-19-related brain injury develops in acute respiratory distress syndrome-patients after life-saving re-oxygenation. We studied ten COVID+ patients (COVID+) with unusual delirium associated with neuroimaging suggestive of diffuse brain injury, and seven controls with non-COVID encephalopathy. The assessment took place when the intractable delirium started at weaning off ventilation support. We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by standard cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-analyses and assessment of CSF-erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations (as a marker for the assessment of tissue repair), and of non-targeted CSF-metabolomics using LC-HR-Mass Spectrometry. Patients were similar as regards severity scores, but COVID+ were hospitalized longer (25 [11.75; 25] versus 9 [4.5; 12.5] days, p=0.03). On admission, but not at MRI and lumbar puncture performance, COVID+ were more hypoxic (p=0.002). On MRI, there were leptomeningeal enhancement and diffuse white matter hemorrhages only in COVID+. In the latter, CSF-EPO concentration was lower (1.73 [1.6; 2.06] versus 3.04 [2.9; 3.91] mUI/ml, p= 0.01), and CSF-metabolomics indicated: a) increased compounds such as foodborne molecules (sequiterpenes), molecules from industrialized beverages, and micro-pollutants (di-ethanolamine); b) decreased molecules as incomplete breakdown-products of protein catabolism, and foodborne molecules (glabridin). At 3-month discharge, fatigue, anxiety and depression as well as MRI lesions persisted in COVID+. Some COVID+ patients are at risk of a specific delirium. Imperfect brain repair after re-oxygenation and lifestyle factors might influence long-lasting brain injuries in a context of foodborne micro-pollutants.","Schneider, Agin, Baldacini, Maurer, Schenck, Alemann, Solis, Helms, Villette, Artzner, Kremer, Heintz","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14776","20210214","COVID; brain; delirium; erythropoietin; hypoxia; metabolomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10770,""

"Psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 lockdown: A two-wave network analysis","Although preliminary research has evidenced negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population, little research has been carried out examining the interplay among the broader dimensions and correlates of individual distress. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie some components of psychological distress and their changes over time (during and post COVID-19-related lockdown). 1,129 adult participants (79.1% women) completed a two-wave online survey during and after the lockdown, and reported on variables such as depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID, intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation and social support. The networks were estimated via Gaussian Graphical Models and their temporal changes were compared through the centrality measures. Depression, stress, anxiety and fear of COVID formed a spatially contiguous pattern, which remained unchanged in both the two waves. After the lockdown, the fear of COVID node reduced its strength in the network, whereas inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and emotion suppression were associated with depression. Emotion regulation was connected to depression, but not to stress and anxiety during both waves. Perceived emotional support had few connections to the other nodes. Only 32.7% of participants provided complete responses for both waves. The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on adults. In the context of the network approach, depressive symptoms had the highest strength and their associations to other dimensions of individual distress may be key factors in understanding the influence of exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health.","Di Blasi, Gullo, Mancinelli, Freda, Esposito, Gelo, Lagetto, Giordano, Mazzeschi, Pazzagli, Salcuni, Lo Coco","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016","20210214","COVID-19; Depression; Emotion regulation; Fear of COVID: Intolerance of uncertainty; Network analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10772,""
"MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND BEYOND: THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VAGUS NERVE FOR BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL RESILIENCE","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread increases in mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. The development of these and other psychiatric disorders may be related to changes in immune, endocrine, autonomic/physiological, cognitive, and affective processes induced by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, many of these same changes can be triggered by psychosocial stressors such as social isolation and rejection, which have become increasingly common due to public policies aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The present review aims to shed light on these issues by describing how viral infections and stress affect mental health. First, we describe the multi-level mechanisms linking viral infection and life stress exposure with risk for psychopathology. Then, we summarize how resilience can be enhanced by targeting vagus nerve function by, for example, applying transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and targeting lifestyle factors, such as exercise. With these biopsychosocial insights in mind, researchers and healthcare professionals will be better equipped to reduce risk for psychopathology and increase resilience during this challenging pandemic period and beyond.","Dedoncker, Vanderhasselt, Ottaviani, Slavich","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010","20210214","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Lifestyle Interventions; Psychiatric Disorders; Social Stress; Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10773,""
"A Developmental Pathway From Early Behavioral Inhibition to Young Adults' Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to young adults' lives, resulting in mental health difficulties for many; however, some individuals are particularly prone to heightened anxiety. Little is known about the early life predictors of anxiety during the pandemic. We examined a developmental pathway from behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by fearful responses towards novelty, to changes in young adults' anxiety during the initial period of the pandemic. We hypothesized that a stable pattern of BI across early childhood would predict greater adolescent worry dysregulation, which in turn would predict increases in young adult anxiety during a stressful phase of the pandemic. Participants (N = 291; 54% female) were followed from toddlerhood to young adulthood. BI was observed at ages 2 and 3. Social wariness was observed at age 7. Participants rated their worry dysregulation in adolescence (age 15) and anxiety in young adulthood (age 18) at two assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic, one month apart. A significant moderated mediation, in which a stable pattern of BI from toddlerhood to childhood, as compared to the absence of this pattern, predicted greater worry dysregulation in adolescence. Worry dysregulation predicted elevated young adult anxiety in the second assessment during COVID-19, even after accounting for the first assessment. This study identifies a developmental pathway from toddlerhood BI to young adults' elevated anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings have implications for early identification of individuals at risk for dysregulated worry and the prevention of anxiety during stressful life events in young adulthood.","Zeytinoglu, Morales, Lorenzo, Chronis-Tuscano, Degnan, Almas, Henderson, Pine, Fox","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2021.01.021","20210214","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; behavioral inhibition; temperament; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10774,""

The ProQOL assessed respondents for compassion satisfaction (subcategorized as burnout and STS) and compassion fatigue. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the prevalence of burnout and STS. Four hundred eighty-four health-system pharmacists completed the survey. Based on respondents' self-ratings of burnout, 47% were identified as having current burnout and 81% as having a history of burnout. Based on ProQOL scoring, 65.3% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high likelihood of burnout, which was a prevalence higher than that indicated by respondents' self-ratings. Additionally, 51.4% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high probability of STS and 99.4% as having a moderate or high probability of compassion satisfaction. The survey found that over half of health-system pharmacists were affected with burnout, half with STS, and three-fourths with compassion satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the development of burnout and STS in these health-system pharmacists may lead to several work-related consequences (eg, increase risk of medical errors, depression); therefore, addressing burnout and STS is crucial. Further studies of the consequences of burnout and STS during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","Jones, Clark, Mohammad","https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab051","20210213","COVID-19; ProQOL; burnout; compassion; coronavirus; pharmacists; stress; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10778,""
"Healthcare Providers' Challenges During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Qualitative Approach","The uncertain trajectory of COVID-19 has led to significant psychosocial impacts on nurses and other healthcare providers. Given the critical role of these providers in pandemic response, this study sought to gain a better understanding of the challenges faced by healthcare providers caring for adult patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive, qualitative study was conducted via semi-structured interviews. A purposeful sample of healthcare providers (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23) caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was recruited to participate in interviews via snowball sampling and an information systems-supported recruiting process (e-recruiting). Thematic analysis revealed four themes: Managing isolation, fear, and increased anxiety; 2) adapting to changes in healthcare practice and policy; 3) addressing emotional and physical needs of patients and their families; and 4) navigating evolving workplace safety. New evidence was introduced about nurses practicing outside their usual role. Nurses and other healthcare providers consistently reported increased anxiety during the pandemic. Hospital administrations can proactively support healthcare providers during this and future pandemics by ensuring access to mental health programs, standardizing communication, and developing plans that address equipment and supply availability.","Ness, Saylor, Di Fusco, Evans","https://doi.org/10.1111/nhs.12820","20210213","COVID-19; Nurses; healthcare providers; mental health; pandemics; support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10779,""
"Depression, anxiety and stress among patients with inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: Australian national survey","The global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the mental health of individuals, particularly those with chronic illnesses. We aimed to quantify stress, anxiety and depression among individuals with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Australia during the pandemic. An electronic survey was made available to IBD patients Australia-wide from 17 June to 12 July 2020. Respondents with an underlying diagnosis of IBD and over 18 years of age were included. A validated questionnaire (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Score-21, DASS21) was used to assess depression, anxiety and stress. Data on potential predictors of depression, anxiety and stress were collected. 352 participated in the survey across Australia. 60.5% of respondents fulfilled DASS criteria for at least moderate depression, anxiety or stress. 45% reported a pre-existing diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Over 2/3 of these respondents reported worsening of their pre-existing depression/anxiety due to the current pandemic. Of those without a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety or depression, high rates of at least moderate to severe depression (34.9%), anxiety (32.0%) and stress (29.7%) were noted. Younger age (OR 0.96, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.94 to 0.98, p&lt;0.001), lack of access to an IBD nurse (OR 1.81, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.03 to 3.19, p=0.04) and lack of education on reducing infection risk (OR 1.99, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.13 to 3.50, p=0.017) were associated with significant stress, anxiety and/or depression. High prevalence of undiagnosed depression, anxiety and stress was identified among respondents. Improved access to IBD nurse support and greater attention to education are modifiable factors that may reduce depression, anxiety and/or stress among patients with IBD during the pandemic.","Cheema, Mitrev, Hall, Tiongson, Ahlenstiel, Kariyawasam","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgast-2020-000581","20210215","COVID-19; crohn's disease; inflammatory bowel disease; psychological stress; ulcerative colitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10780,""
"A large-scale study of changes to the quantity, quality, and distribution of video game play during the COVID-19 pandemic","Video game play has been framed both as protective factor and risk to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an objective analysis of changes to video game play during the pandemic to provide an empirical foundation to the fractured discourse surrounding play and mental health. Analyses of millions of playersâ€™ engagement with the 500 globally most popular games on the Steam platform indicated that the quantity of play had dramatically increased during key points of the pandemic; that those increases were more prominent for multiplayer games, suggesting that gamers were seeking out the social affordances of video game play; and that play had become more equally distributed across days of the week, suggesting increased merging of leisure activities with work and school activities. These data provide a starting point for empirically grounded discussions on video games during the pandemic, their uses, and potential effects.","Matti Vuorre et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46180-1F1-BB2","20210216","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; video games","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-16","",10781,""
