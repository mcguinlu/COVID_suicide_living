"Network analysis of anxiety and depressive symptoms among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic<sup><U+2730></sup>","Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the mental health and well-being of medical personnel, including nursing students. Network analysis provides a deeper characterization of symptom-symptom interactions in mental disorders. The aim of this study was to elucidate characteristics of anxiety and depressive symptom networks of Chinese nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A total of 932 nursing students were included. Anxiety and depressive symptom were measured using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), respectively. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms were identified via centrality indices and bridge centrality indices, respectively. Network stability was examined using the case-dropping procedure. Results: Irritability, Uncontrollable worry, Trouble relaxing, and Depressed mood had the highest centrality values. Three bridge symptoms (Depressed mood, Nervousness, and Anhedonia) were also identified. Neither gender nor region of residence was associated with network global strength, distribution of edge weights or individual edge weights. Limitations: Data were collected in a cross-sectional study design, therefore, causal relations and dynamic changes between anxiety and depressive symptoms over time could not be inferred. Generalizability of findings may be limited to Chinese nursing students during a particular phase of the current pandemic. Conclusions: Irritability, Uncontrollable worry, Trouble relaxing, and Depressed mood constituted central symptoms maintaining the anxiety-depression network structure of Chinese nursing students during the pandemic. Timely, systemic multi-level interventions targeting central symptoms and bridge symptoms may be effective in alleviating co-occurring experiences of anxiety and depression in this population.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.072","20211101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-09","",16938,""
"Does it help to talk about it? Co-rumination, internalizing symptoms, and committed action during the COVID-19 global pandemic","Co-rumination (defined as perseverative, negatively-focused discussions about problems) has been linked to internalizing symptoms, especially following psychosocial stress. The sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during Spring 2020 may have been a common focus of co-rumination. Conceptualized within a contextual behavioral science framework, the current study examined pandemic-focused co-rumination and its components: co-brooding (i.e., passively dwelling on concerns and associated consequences and negative emotions in a dyadic context) and co-reflection (i.e., repetitively discussing problems dyadically to enhance insight). A total of 320 undergraduates (62Â %, female, 37Â % male, 1Â % non-binary gender) completed an online survey from late April-early May 2020 shortly after their universities abruptly ended in-person instruction and removed students from campus. COVID-19-focused co-rumination (specifically co-brooding) was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms. Co-brooding and co-reflection each moderated the association between COVID-19 stress exposure and a) internalizing symptoms (COVID-related fears and depressive symptoms) and b) committed action, but in opposite directions, with co-brooding predicting increased symptoms and decreased committed action, and co-reflection predicting the opposite. Results suggest that when the nature of social support-seeking discussions promote psychological flexibility via increased perspective and understanding (vs. dwelling on negative content of experiences), they may ameliorate emotional distress and promote committed action following stress exposure.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2021.07.004","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-09","",16939,""

"Seafarers mental health: What we know and impact of COVID 19 pandemic","Les marins sont exposÃ©s Ã  de multiples risques physiques et psychiques. Au cours des derniÃ¨res annÃ©es, des Ã©tudes ont mis en exergue des pathologies spÃ©cifiques comme la fatigue, lâ€™ennui mais aussi des syndromes anxiodÃ©pressifs. Les marins sont Ã©galement Ã  risque de dÃ©velopper des syndromes de stress post-traumatique (piraterie, accidents de navire ou du travail). La pandÃ©mie de COVID-19Â impacte fortement les marins avec une estimation de 400Â 000Â dâ€™entre eux embarquÃ©s autour du monde avec des prolongations de durÃ©es de missions, des difficultÃ©s de rapatriement, de relÃ¨ve dâ€™Ã©quipage et des soucis financiers liÃ©s Ã  la baisse du transport maritime et de fait des embarquements et des impayÃ©s de salaires. Seafarers are exposed to several physical and psychosocial stressors. Recent studies highlighted specific disorders as fatigue, boredom and diseases as depression. Seafarers are also commonly exposed to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (piracy, accidents, threats). COVID-19 impact seafarers with an estimated 400,000 of whom are stranded on vessels around the world, with extended time on board, repatriation's difficulties and the financial concerns of the unexpectedly unemployed. International Maritime Organisation IMO has established the Seafarer Crisis Action Team (SCAT) to help them. In France, in last 10 months a call-center received 142 calls from 32 seafarers for psychological phone consultations mostly linked to this era. With the increase of duration of the COVID-19 crisis, psychological health care, repatriations and financial solutions are needed for seafarers.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.admp.2021.05.001","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-09","",16941,""
