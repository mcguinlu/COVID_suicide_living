"â€œWeâ€™ve been in lockdown since he was bornâ€: Experiences of families caring for children with intellectual disability during the Covid-19 pandemic","Objectives: This study aimed to explore the experiences of parents caring for children with intellectual and developmental disability during the UK national lockdown in spring 2020, resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. Design: Participants were identified using opportunity sampling from the IMAGINE-ID national (UK) cohort, and completed an online survey followed by a semi-structured interview. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Setting: Interviews were conducted over the telephone in July 2020 as the first UK lockdown was ending. Participants: 23 mothers of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities aged 5 to 15 were recruited. Results: Themes reported by parents included: managing pre-existing challenges during a time of extreme change, having mixed emotions about the benefits and difficulties that arose during the lockdown, and the need for appropriate, individualised support. Conclusions: Observations raised by parents suggested recommendations for policy in the event of future pandemic restrictions, namely: empowering parents as experts, providing tailored digital intervention, and supporting parentsâ€™ mental health to support children.","Jeanne Wolstencroft et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A5-44E-D48","20210222","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurodevelopmental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; covid-19; pandemic; autism; mental health; intellectual disability; developmental disability","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-22","",10988,""
