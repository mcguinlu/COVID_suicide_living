"Panic Disorder Induced by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in a Patient with Organic Mood Disorder Successfully Treated with Vortioxetine","We present a case of panic disorder induced by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in a patient with an organic mood disorder  The patient was a 62-year-old woman with mild mood swings and reduced motivation and volition caused by a traumatic brain injury after a traffic accident  She was maintained on carbamazepine (600 mg/day)  When the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Japan, she developed concerns regarding the illness and complained of multiple episodes of panic attacks  Further, her depressive symptoms worsened  Thus, vortioxetine was added to the ongoing CBZ treatment  Four weeks after initiating vortioxetine treatment, the symptoms of panic disorder and depressive state were ameliorated  The present case suggests that vortioxetine augmentation can improve symptoms of depressive state and panic disorder induced by the COVID-19 pandemic  [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Case Reports in Psychiatry is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission  However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use  This abstract may be abridged  No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy  Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract  (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Yoshimura, Reiji, Okamoto, Naomichi, Konishi, Yuki, Ikenouchi, Atsuko","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8870014","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Case Reports in Psychiatry;: 1-3, 2020.; Publication details: Case Reports in Psychiatry;: 1-3, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-07","",6919,""
"413 - Telehealth in Multiethnic Caregiver Support Group: Transition from Telephone to Video in the Age of COVID-19","Background:Caregivers of persons with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Other Dementias are a population in need of support as they are vulnerable to emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion associated with caregiver burnout  While CDC guidelines state that social distancing is the greatest protective factor, it can already exacerbate feelings of isolation and stress  Technology offers the opportunity to maximize socialization and access to healthcare;however, research shows that digital platforms are most underutilized by older and lower socioeconomic patients Objective:This report describes the transition of a weekly caregiver support group from telephone to video conferencing to improve connectedness during a period of social isolation Method:In 2020, the caregiver support group met weekly over the phone  At each session, there were increased discussions of moving the telephone support group to a video platform  A focused discussion about technology platforms was held to gain an understanding of caregiver attitudes and thoughts regarding technology in which caregivers worried that a video platform would be intrusive and invasive  In June 2020, unreliable phone service resulted in the group transitioning to video Results:The caregiver group consisted of 5 active members, 2 African American, 2 Asian, and 1 Caucasian  Initial problems included connectivity issues, needing to switch to multiple devices, and assistance with troubleshooting and utilizing the platform  However, caregivers reported feeling that the transition to video was the most natural next step and assisted with reducing feelings of isolation, anxiety, and fear they reported as a result of social distancing due to COVID-19  Caregivers reported feeling connected and because they knew each other so intimately, no longer felt video was intrusive Conclusions:For older populations who are not familiar with technology, it is important to take steps before beginning a new platform service  This allows for a natural progression to unfamiliar technology  The video platform provided an opportunity for caregivers to be together while apart, which is important for mental health and decreasing caregiver burden","Loizos, Maria, Chin, Shehan, Umpierre, Mari, Sano, Mary","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610220002665","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics;32(S1):129, 2020.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics;32(S1):129, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-07","",6920,""
"Evidence of Exacerbated Gender Inequality in Child Care Obligations in Canada and Australia during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Households in Canada and Australia have exhibited similar trends in the gendered allocation of additional child care responsibilities resulting from policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic  In this paper, we employ survey data to analyze the extent to which policy interventions related to COVID-19 have exacerbated gender disparities in child care obligations  We find that existing asymmetrical distributions of child care obligations in Canada and Australia have been amplified during the pandemic, resulting in a disproportionate burden on women  We also find that, throughout the pandemic, women in households with children report poorer mental health than men do  Â© 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins  All rights reserved","Johnston, R.

"Correctional and Sentencing Law Commentary: Why Is Prison Food Still So Bad?","Scott-Hayward explores the quality of prison food in the US  On May 11, 2020, during the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, reporter Keri Blakinger published an expose on the inadequate food served in Texas prisons  Because of lockdowns instituted as a result of COVID-19 infections in forty prisons, most people were confined to their cells  According to Blakinger, their food now arrives at odd hours in paper bags, cold, mushy and without a hint of green  Mostly it's stale white bread and mystery meat, with the occasional helping of raisins or prunes  While the lockdowns, which have also prevented access to some commissaries, have exacerbated the problem, such low quality food is fairly common  In Texas, like many other states, prison food has been getting worse for years  Despite the lawsuits filed against prisons and jails across the country for years, little has changed  Food continues to be a significant source of complaints by incarcerated people  Here, the effects of cost-cutting changes that states have made to their correctional food service, including privatization and the types of nutrition and safety issues with prison food are examined","Scott-Hayward, Christine S.","https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/en/mdl-2457318276","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Criminal Law Bulletin;56(5):1004, 2020.; Publication details: Criminal Law Bulletin;56(5):1004, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-07","",6922,""
