"Analysis of Clinical Parameters, Drug Consumption and Use of Health Resources in a Southern European Population with Alcohol Abuse Disorder during COVID-19 Pandemic","The disruption in healthcare attention to people with alcohol dependence, along with psychological decompensation as a consequence of lockdown derived from the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on people who suffer from alcohol abuse disorder. Observational real world data pre-post study included 9966 men aged &gt;16 years registered as having the diagnosis of alcohol abuse disorder in the electronic medical records (EMR) of the Aragon Regional Health Service (Spain). Clinical (Glutamate-oxaloacetate -GOT-, Glutamate pyruvate -GPT-, creatinine, glomerular filtration, systolic blood pressure -SBP-, diastolic blood pressure -DBP-, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and body mass index -BMI-), pharmacological (dose per inhabitant per day, DHD, of drugs used in addictive disorders, benzodiazepines and antidepressants) and health resource use variables (primary and specialized care) were considered. A Student&rsquo;s t-test for matched samples was performed to analyze the changes in clinical variables between alcohol abuse disorder patients with and without COVID-19. Only creatinine and LDL showed a significant but clinically irrelevant change six months after the end of the strict lockdown. The total number of DHDs for all drugs included in the study (except for benzodiazepines), decreased. In the same way, the use of health services by these patients also decreased. The impact of COVID-19 among this group of patients has been moderate. The reorganization of health and social services after the declaration of the state of alarm in our country made possible the maintenance of care for this vulnerable population.","Lear-Claveras, Ana, GonzÃ¡lez-Ãlvarez, Beatriz, Couso-Viana, Sabela, ClaverÃ­a, Ana, OlivÃ¡n-BlÃ¡zquez, BÃ¡rbara","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031358","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1358, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26127,""
"Age-related differences in depressive symptoms and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: A longitudinal study","Objective The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has particularly influenced the mental health of younger adults;accordingly, this study investigated age-related factors related to mental health and provided suggestions related to mental health recovery. Methods A web-based longitudinal survey was conducted from 2020 to 2021 in Japan. The survey consisted of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), used to measure depressive symptoms as a response variable, and an anger questionnaire and coping strategy scale to assess explanatory variables. Results A total of 1468 participants were analyzed (valid response rateÂ =Â 54.2%);368 were younger adults (age rangeÂ =Â 20â€“39), 667 were middle-aged adults (age rangeÂ =Â 40â€“64), and 433 were aged adults (age rangeÂ =Â 65â€“79). The PHQ-9 scores in the younger adults worsened over the three survey timepoints. State anger was strongly related to PHQ-9 scores in all age groups (standardized betaÂ =Â 0.39â€“0.47), and state anger in the younger group was highest at all survey times, In the younger group, only nonadaptive coping strategies were related to PHQ-9 scores. Emotional support, venting, and humor adaptive strategies used by middle-aged and aged adults were most commonly used by younger adults;however, there were no significant relationships of these strategies with PHQ-9 scores in the younger group. Conclusion The level of depressive symptoms among the younger adults might be considerably worse than the middle-aged and aged adult. The younger adults might not make use of strategies, hence, they might need advice and skill training of strategies.","Fukase, Yuko, Ichikura, Kanako, Murase, Hanako, Tagaya, Hirokuni","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110737","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychosomatic Research;: 110737, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26128,""

"Rural Healthcare Workers' Experiences and Needs During the Initial Stages of COVID-19","Rural healthcare workers are experiencing barriers to accessing supports for their own mental health and well-being. Findings from an online survey during the initial stages of the COVID-19 health pandemic reveal that healthcare workers (N=137) in rural and non-metropolitan Manitoba, Canada, are increasingly stressed by fluctuating COVID-19 protocols and policies and face challenges such as lack of anonymity and stigma about their mental health concerns. The health pandemic has amplified existing challenges to healthcare in rural places and has created extended periods of stress and isolation for healthcare workers. Implications to policies and practices relevant to providing essential mental health supports to reduce the likelihood of long-term negative health outcomes are discussed.

"Harm Reduction and Health Services provided by Syringe Services Programs in 2019 and subsequent impact of COVID-19 on Services in 2020<U+2606>","Objectives This study describes harm reduction and health services provided by U.S syringe services programs (SSPs) in 2019 and changes in provision of those services in 2020. Methods SSPs were invited to participate in the Dave Purchase Memorial survey in August 2020. We collected programmatic data on services provided in 2019 and at the time of the survey in 2020. We conducted descriptive analyses using Chi-square and McNemarâ€™s tests. Results At the time of the survey, &gt;60% of SSPs reported increased monthly syringe and naloxone distribution and expansion of home-based and mail-based naloxone delivery in Fall 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately three-quarters of SSPs decreased or stopped providing on-site HIV and HCV testing. Nearly half of SSPs offering on-site medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in 2019 increased provision of MOUD in 2020. The proportion of SSPs offering on-site mental health care services and primary care services statistically significantly decreased from 2019 to Fall 2020, but telehealth offerings of these services increased. Conclusions Many SSPs that offered health services in 2019 and remained operational in 2020 increased telehealth provision of mental health and primary care services, increased MOUD provision, and expanded harm reduction services, but most SSPs reduced or stopped on-site HIV and HCV testing. Sustaining SSP growth and innovation is paramount for preventing overdose deaths and HIV/HCV outbreaks after the deadliest year of the opioid epidemic in 2020.","Behrends, Czarina N.; Lu, Xinlin, Corry, Grace J.; LaKosky, Paul, Prohaska, Stephanie M.; Glick, Sara N.; Kapadia, Shashi N.; Perlman, David C.; Schackman, Bruce R.; Des Jarlais, Don C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Harm+Reduction+and+Health+Services+provided+by+Syringe+Services+Programs+in+2019+and+subsequent+impact+of+COVID-19+on+Services+in+2020<U+2606>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Drug and alcohol dependence;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26131,""

"Hubungan pengetahuan, paritas, pekerjaan ibu dengan keteraturan kunjungan ibu hamil untuk ANC selama masa pandemi COVID-19","ANC is an examination of pregnancy to optimize the physical and mental health of pregnant women to reduce maternal and child mortality during the pandemic although many factors can affect it including knowledge parity and maternal occupation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of these factors on the regularity of ANC visits to pregnant women in the COVID-19 pandemic era and to determine the most influential factors. Methods: This research was conducted in the Mandala Public Health Center with 91 pregnant women as respondents or the total population when analyzing the data could be processed into 83 people. The statistical test used is Chi Square to determine the most influential factors using a logistic regression test with the assumption that the data is normally distributed. Results: The results showed that the relationship between knowledge and regularity of doing ANC was obtained p value = 0.412, which means that there is no significant relationship. The relationship between parity and regularity in conducting ANC obtained a significant value of p value = 0.015, which means that there is a significant relationship between respondentsâ€™ parity and regularity in conducting ANC. The relationship between work and regularity of doing ANC obtained a significant value of p value = 0.826, which means there is no significant relationship. The regularity of visits by pregnant women to perform ANC is not related to knowledge parity and maternal occupation. This research is expected to be an input to develop a work program in increasing ANC coverage during a pandemic in order to minimize the incidence of maternal and infant mortality. Keywords: ANC Regularity;Knowledge;Parity;Occupation ANC merupakan pemeriksaan atas kehamilan untuk mengoptimalkan kesehatan fisik dan mental ibu hamil untuk menekan angka kematian ibu dan anak masa masa pandemic meskipun banyak faktor yang dapat mempengaruhinya diantaranya pengetahuan, paritas, dan pekerjaan ibu.

"Analysis of COVID-19 prevention behaviour among diabetes mellitus comorbidity patients in Palembang","COVID-19 in Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients are at higher risk for severe complications than people without DM. Preventive behaviour is the best way to avoid COVID-19 infection for DM patients due to its bad impact such as severe symptoms requiring intensive care leading to death. Objective: This study aims to analyse the COVID-19 preventive behaviour among DM comorbidity patients in Palembang. Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2021 to May 2021 using a questionnaire to diabetic patients at six community health centres in Palembang. The questionnaire has four sections: patient characteristics knowledge attitude and COVID-19 prevention behaviour. A proportional random sampling technique was used to determine the number of samples according to the data on diabetic patients in each health centre. The total sample was 183 respondents from 1.266 total population diabetic patients in six community health centres. Respondents were diabetic patients aged Â³ 18 years old and willing to fill out the questionnaire. Univariate bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to analyse the data. Results: More respondents have good knowledge (50.3%) negative attitude (57.3%) and poor COVID-19 preventive behaviour (53.0%). The findings revealed a statistical significance between knowledge (P-value = 0.0001) attitude (P-value = 0.0001) and educational status (P-value = 0.0001) with COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Furthermore, knowledge is the most determinant factor of COVID-19 preventive behaviour (PR= 7.597 95% CI: 3.701 â€“ 15.597). Conclusion: According to this study diabetic patients with poor knowledge are at greater risk of having poor COVID-19 prevention behaviours. COVID-19 prevention programs, especially health education programs at the community health centre need to be improved to ensure that diabetic patients adopt reasonable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention practices.","Putri, Giszka, Hasyim, Hamzah, Fajar Nur, Alam","https://doi.org/10.20473/jpk.V9.I2.2021.168-176","","Database: Indonesian Research; Publication details: Jurnal Promkes: The Indonesian Journal of Health Promotion and Health Education; 9(2):168-176, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26166,""
"Disrupting higher education: Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on higher education institutions in Indonesia and the United States","This paper examines the impact of COVID-19 on higher education institutions in Indonesia and the United States using qualitative document analysis dedicated to higher education institutions. The findings suggest that the perplexing problems found in higher education institutions have downcutting the ability to achieve equal distribution of quality education, and the crisis caused by COVID-19 has made higher education less accessible specifically towards under-privileged students.

"Psychosocial support in increasing COVID-19 and mental health in the elderly","RW 01 Rancanumpang merupakan area komunitas dengan jumlah usia lansia (242%) terbanyak kedua setelah usia dewasa (418%). Posbindu sebagai tempat pelayanan kesehatan yang mudah dijangkau oleh lansia telah di non aktifkan sejak Maret 2020 sebagai upaya meminimalkan penyebaran COVID-19. Hal ini menyebabkan munculnya masalah psikososial bagi lansia karena tidak adanya akses untuk melakukan pemeriksaan kesehatan secara periodik. Oleh karena itu kegiatan ini bertujuan untuk mengaktifkan kembali Posbindu dan memberikan dukungan psikososial agar dapat mengoptimalkan kesehatan lansia. Metode pelaksanaan kegiatan ini meliputi penyuluhan tentang Adaptasi Kebiasaan Baru (AKB);penjelasan dan simulasi pelaksanaan Posbindu menggunakan protokol pencegahan penularan COVID-19;dan demonstrasi teknik penanganan masalah psikososial. Kegiatan ini melibatkan lansia dan kader sebagai sasaran kegiatan dan tim EFT sebagai trainer dan fasilitator saat demonstrasi penanganan masalah psikososial. Hasil dari kegiatan ini yaitu terlaksananya rangkaian kegiatan yang dihadiri oleh para lansia dan kader sesuai dengan perencanaan adanya peningkatan pengetahuan lansia tentang AKB peningkatan kemampuan kader dalam melaksanakan Posbindu menggunakan protokol kesehatan dan peningkatan kemampuan lansia untuk mempraktikkan Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) dalam penanganan masalah psikososial serta penurunan masalah psikososial setelah diberikannya EFT pada lansia. Diharapkan kader dapat memberikan dukungan psikososial pada lansia sehingga lansia mampu beradaptasi dengan berbagai perubahan di era new normal. RW 01 Rancanumpang is a community area with the second-highest number of elderly (24.2%) after adulthood (41.8%). Posbindu as a place of health services that are easily accessible to the elderly has been deactivated since March 2020 as an effort to minimize the spread of COVID-19. This situation causes concern and the emergence of psychosocial problems for the elderly because they do not have access to periodic medical examinations. Therefore, the objective of implementing activities in the form of reactivating Posbindu and providing psychosocial support is expected to help optimize the health status of the elderly in RW 01 Rancanumpang. The implementation of this activity uses several methods namely counseling on New Habit Adaptation (AKB);explanation and simulation of the implementation of Posbindu using a protocol for preventing transmission of COVID-19 and demonstration of psychosocial problem management techniques in the elderly. This activity involves the elderly community and cadres as the target of the activity and the EFT team as trainers and facilitators during demonstrations of handling psychosocial problems. The result of this activity is the implementation of a series of activities attended by the elderly and cadres according to the plan. There is an increase in the knowledge of the elderly about IMR an increase in the ability of cadres in implementing Posbindu using health protocols and an increase in the ability of the elderly to practice Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) in handling psychosocial problems and a decrease in psychosocial problems after EFT is given to the elderly. The conclusion is that there is an increase in the knowledge of the elderly after being given counseling on AKB cadres can apply health protocols in the implementation of posbindu and the elderly experience a decrease in psychosocial problems after being given EFT. It is hoped that cadres can provide psychosocial support to the elderly so that the elderly can adapt to various changes in the new normal era.","Muliani, Rizki, Jayanti Tri, Nur, Dirgahayu, Inggrid, Safarudin, Irfan, Anri, Anri","https://journal.ummat.ac.id/index.php/JCES/article/view/3445","","Database: Indonesian Research; Publication details: JCES (Journal of Character Education Society); 4(1):135-147, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26181,""

"Pemberdayaan masyarakat dalam memintas mata rantai penyebaran COVID-19 dengan pendekatan PHBS (Perilaku Hidup Bersih dan Sehat) di Desa Muara Batun Kabupaten Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI)","WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and declared a pandemic due to the alarming level of spread and severity of the outbreak. This virus causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe illnesses such as acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). It is estimated that by September 2020 more than 27.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 900 thousand deaths. Various attempts have been made to reduce the rate of spread of this Coronavirus. However, individual behavior in maintaining personal hygiene and health is a major factor in cutting the COVID-19 chain. Muara Batun is one of the villages in Jejawi District, OKI Regency, South Sumatra which is included in the yellow zone (low risk) in the spread of COVID-19. Since the implementation of the adaptation of new normal, the awareness of residents to implement health regulations during the pandemic has been violated a lot. The purpose of this activity is to regenerate awareness, increase participation and participation of citizens in bypassing the COVID-19 chain with the PHBS approach. The method of this activity uses the Partner Village Development (PPDM) model in the form of community empowerment by implementing interprofessional interventions based on Interprofessional Collaboration (IPC) and the Inter Professional Education (IPE) approach. The results of this activity have had a positive impact. A joint commitment between citizens and stakeholders is needed in cutting the COVID-19 chain, one of which is the willingness of each individual to adopt good habits adopted from good behavior during the pandemic and willing to become agents of change to invite other individuals to cultivate PHBS in their daily lives.

Health care providers, older people and people with underlying health conditions are the most vulnerable to the pandemic.

Efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology clinical features transmission patterns and management of COVID-19 disease. One aspect overlooked is the mental health crisis underpinning the effects of self-isolation/quarantine and the deaths of loved ones, the number of positive cases in Malaysia at an exponential growth rate each day. With strict preventive measures and restrictions by the Malaysian Government in the form of nationwide Movement Control Order (also known as MCO) the citizens are going through a range of psychological and emotional reactions and fear and uncertainty of being one of the infected. Many studies have been conducted to identify the state of mental health of people during this calamity. This raises ethical concerns and legal issues with regards to the rights of individuals enduring mental illness. This paper explores the ethical issues about the research on mental health during COVID-19 pandemics and the regulatory mechanisms which protect the rights of the persons who have the symptoms of mental illness.","Idris Siti, Hafsyah, Raduan Nor Jannah, Nasution, Hashim Nurul, Azreen, Jauhari Nadiah, Thanthawi, Subbian Roslinda, Mohd","https://doi.org/10.20473/ydk.v36i2.27132","","Database: Indonesian Research; Publication details: Yuridika; 36(2):477-492, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26199,""

The obscurity in overcoming this virus is the background of the interventions applied. Several interventions conducted such as nationwide lockdowns, quarantine and isolation. In addition, to avoid the virus transmission these interventions also have psychological impacts that affect mental health. We did a review of the mental health outcomes referring to several interventions amid COVID-19 outbreak using two databases. Out of 302 papers found by the search engine 5 articles were counted in this review. Most reviewed research proclaimed adverse mental health problems along with anxiety stress and post-traumatic stress disorder. Stressors consist of infection fears, grief, boredom, stigma, faulty information, short sleep duration and minimum social activities. Several researchers have proposed abiding effects. Social interventions which are imposed limit the process of meeting the needs of human life. It is crucial to point out the mental health of the population and take charge to diminish its adverse effects for the time being.

The practice of this remembrance indirectly has a considerable influence on the physical condition of the congregation who follows the practice of remembrance. The panic experienced by the public regarding the increasing mortality rate during the PPKM period can be quelled by the peace of mind that results from the practice of this remembrance. Therefore, the mental and physical health of the community will be maintained without ignoring the health protocols determined by the government. Keywords: Spiritual action;PPKM;Physical and Mental Health Sejak pandemi COVID-19 muncul pada akhir tahun 2019 di China, seluruh tatanan kehidupan masyarakat dunia berubah drastis. Seiring dengan meningkatnya jumlah pasien terpapar COVID-19 dan jumlah pasien yang meninggal serta diberlakukannya Kebijakan Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Aktivitas Masyarakat di Pulau Jawa-Bali sesuai Instruksi Menteri Dalam Negeri. Nomor 01-04 Tahun 2021 ternyata meningkatkan kecemasan dan masalah kesehatan serta mental bagi masyarakat. Berdasarkan kondisi tersebut maka sangat diperlukan berbagai aspek penanganan mulai dari pencegahan, penyembuhan, pemulihan, dan juga mengatasi munculnya gangguan kecemasan. Pentingnya Pondok Pesantren sebagai lembaga pendidikan Islam dalam kondisi seperti ini akan menjadi benteng iman dan imun dalam menghadapi COVID-19. Tindakan spiritual yang dianalisis adalah amalan zikir surat keterangan penolakan COVID-19 dari KH. Amalan zikir ini secara tidak langsung memiliki pengaruh yang cukup besar terhadap kondisi fisik jemaah yang mengikuti amalan zikir. Kepanikan yang dialami masyarakat terkait meningkatnya angka kematian selama periode PPKM dapat diredam dengan ketenangan jiwa yang dihasilkan dari pengamalan zikir ini. Dengan demikian, kesehatan mental dan fisik santri maupun masyarakat akan tetap terjaga tanpa mengabaikan protokol kesehatan yang telah ditetapkan pemerintah.

"Particulate matter as a driven factor COVID-19 transmission at outdoor: Review","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus) which attacks the respiratory tract with mild to severe symptoms. The virus can infect the body through mucous membranes on the face with droplet transmission. Air pollution is thought to contribute to COVID-19 events which can worsen the situation of people with COVID-19. The aim of this literature review is to analyze Particulate Matter (PM) as environmental factors that contribute to COVID-19 so it is expected to be a study in terms of prevention and prevention in the field of environmental health. PM is thought to have contributed to an increased risk of mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 events. PM which has toxic properties can enter the lungs and affect the physiological condition of the lung organs. The findings regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA strengthen the suspicion that PM plays a role in COVID-19 transmission. Several studies have found that there is a relationship between PM and COVID-19. PM2.5 which is smaller than PM10 has a higher ability to be a risk factor for ballast in COVID-19. The results of this synthesis state that PM can be one of the driving factors of COVID-19 transmission in air.

"Yoga sebagai terapi alternatif terhadap PTSD pada penyintas COVID-19: Tinjauan literatur","Survivors of COVID-19 are vulnerable to trauma as a result of experiencing social isolation during treatment, with fear and loneliness that can have long-term impacts on mental health. In this review, some related literature will be identified and evaluated, using a qualitative-based literature review to research yoga as an alternative treatment to reduce PTSD symptoms, alleviate, or even cure PTSD in COVID-19 survivors. Articles screening from several journals was carried out by tracing PubMedâ€™s journal publication database throughout the last five years and also categorizing two keywords as a reference for reviewing articles. The result of this literature review confirms that COVID-19 has a psychological effect on survivors, especially concerning PTSD when viewed from the largest indication. In addition, based on the results of ongoing research, yoga has shown a significant and promising impact in reducing PTSD symptoms. From this, it can be concluded that although there has been no research that directly examines the causality of the related review, yoga can be an alternative treatment to minimize symptoms and relieve PTSD in COVID-19 survivors. Based on the results of the review, there are many aspects that need to be investigated further, such as the influence of frequency and duration of yoga. More literature review and further research are essential for this topic, especially testing yoga programs as an intervention for COVID-19 survivors to determine its effectiveness and whether it can be implemented as a whole in the society, especially those who are COVID-19 survivors. Keywords: Yoga, treatment, PTSD, COVID-19, literature review Penyintas COVID-19 tergolong rawan terhadap trauma akibat mengalami isolasi sosial selama perawatan, dengan rasa takut dan kesepian yang dapat memberikan dampak berjangka panjang pada kesehatan mental.

Penyaringan artikel dari beberapa jurnal dilakukan dengan menelusuri database publikasi jurnal PubMed dari lima tahun terakhir dan juga dilakukan kategorisasi dua kata kunci sebagai acuan peninjauan artikel. Hasil tinjauan pada literatur ini menegaskan bahwa COVID-19 memiliki dampak psikologis pada penyintas, terutama PTSD apabila dilihat dari indikasi terbesar. Selain itu, berdasarkan hasil penelitian yang telah berlangsung, yoga menunjukkan dampak yang signifikan dan menjanjikan dalam mengurangi gejala PTSD. Dari sini dapat disimpulkan bahwa walaupun belum ada penelitian yang secara langsung meneliti kausalitas dari peninjauan terkait, yoga dapat menjadi salah satu alternatif terapi untuk meminimalisir gejala dan meringankan PTSD pada penyintas COVID-19. Berdasarkan hasil peninjauan, banyak aspek yang perlu diteliti lebih lanjut seperti pengaruh dari frekuensi dan durasi yoga. Dibutuhkan lebih banyak peninjauan literatur dan penelitian lebih lanjut mengenai topik ini, terutama pengujian program yoga sebagai intervensi pada penyintas COVID-19, untuk mengetahui tingkat keefektifannya dan apakah dapat diimplementasikan secara utuh pada masyarakat, terutama yang merupakan penyintas COVID-19.

Interactive model of analysis was used with Derridaâ€™s Deconstruction theory. The result shows that people can be either disciplined or undisciplined in implementing health protocol. People have disciplined behavior because they are aware of positive effect of health protocol discipline on health. Thus, people attempt to be disciplined in wearing mask washing hand social distancing avoiding crowd and reducing mobility. However, people can be undisciplined as well because they do not think of the health effect of health protocol discipline. People receive this pandemic condition and submit their fate to God.

"Depression, anxiety, and stress among students amidst COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study in Philippines","COVID-19 considered a global health crisis, poses mental health problems among individuals and specifics to students. This study aimed to determine the depression, anxiety, and stress levels among students amidst COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. A cross-sectional study was undertaken in Region 8, Eastern Visayas Philippines. A total of 311 tertiary respondents randomly selected both private and government owned higher education institutions. The data compilation was done using online questionnaires through Google Forms with validated version of the Stress, Anxiety and Depression Scales 21 (DASS21) is used to calculate studentâ€™s level of stress, anxiety and, depression with their socio-demographic features. We revealed that depression, anxiety and stress are instituted in 18.6 %, 35.1 % and 2.85% of students, respectively, amidst the COVID-19 pandemics. The symptoms of disorders were moderate to extremely severe in 6.1%, 23.5%, and 0.6% of the study sample, respectively. Age, gender, marital status and family history of illness are significantly different with age group 20 and below, females, singles, and families with no history of illness displaying high levels of anxiety. Results also established an association between anxiety and familyâ€™s monthly income and history of illness. The higher the monthly income and no presence of illness of families, the more anxious the person. Finally, the variables used explained only 1.5% depression, 3.4% anxiety, and 1.4% stress in this time of COVID-19 outbreak. It is therefore recommended to essentially develop community-based mental health programs for preventive purposes.

"Womenâ€™s resilience and vulnerability in facing COVID-19 in DKI Jakarta and East Java","Indonesia ranks 23rdÂ as the most COVID-19 confirmed cases in the world. DKI Jakarta and East Java provinces have the highest cases in Indonesia. However, data on the transmission of COVID-19 in both provinces were not further analyzed regarding vulnerability between genders. This research attempted to compare the differences in the gender distribution of COVID-19 cases by analyzing data from COVID-19 DKI Jakarta and East Java Task Force Information Center and various biological medical and socio-cultural studies to understand risk of women being exposed to COVID-19. The results of this research revealed that both provinces had a higher number of confirmed patients under surveillance (PDP) people under surveillance (ODP) and death cases in men than that of women. In DKI Jakarta the number of recovered cases in men was higher than that of women but in East Java it was not significantly different. Based on literature reviews women were more resilience in manifestations of COVID-19 severity than that of men due to differences in ACE2 gene distribution and expression hormones regulations immune responses comorbidities and ages. However, data from socio-cultural literature reviews in both provinces showed women were vulnerable to be exposed to COVID-19 since many women performed as health workers office workers market traderâ€™s public transportation users and did religious activities.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Oncology Healthcare Providers: The Resilience of a Profession","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has plagued countries worldwide. This pandemic has greatly affected healthcare delivery and those providing care to vulnerable, immunocompromised patients undergoing cancer treatment, who are at a higher risk for poorer outcomes related to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 on oncology healthcare professionals (OHCPs). An exploratory study design was employed using semistructured interviews. A thematic analysis was completed using Atlas.ti software. Of 30 OHCP participants, most were female (90%), registered nurses (70%), and bachelor's prepared (66%). The following themes emerged: (1) pandemic-related restrictions and stress on personal lives impacted the ability of OHCPs to rejuvenate and reenergize for work; (2) fear of exposure and transmission and concern for high-risk status for contracting COVID-19; (3) limited resources and inconsistent communication about organizational policies caused additional stress, affecting OHCP trust and confidence in the system; (4) concern for the mental health of fellow OCHPs; (5) adaptation and resilience were required amidst shifting workloads, workflow, and new restrictions; and (6) importance of self-care to reduce personal/professional stressors. Oncology healthcare professionals continue to face challenges of COVID-19 on their personal and professional lives yet have shown resilience during these unprecedented times. Oncology healthcare professionals need to advocate for appropriate personal protective equipment and reliable mental health support services through employers. They should be engaged in COVID-19 task forces to ensure their challenges are heard and needs are addressed to provide quality oncology care.","Marshall, Mason, Chavez, Martinez-Tyson, Bugajski","https://doi.org/10.1097/NCC.0000000000000954","20220128","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26238,""
"COVID-19 preventive interventions for high-risk pregnant women and preschool children: a rehearsal for the baby boomers' old-age pandemic? : Interventions prÃƒÂ©ventives pour les femmes enceintes et les jeunes enfants Ãƒ risque pendant et aprÃƒÂ¨s la COVID-19 : une prÃƒÂ©paration Ãƒ la pandÃƒÂ©mie du vieillissement des baby-boomers?","A large research-based consensus was achieved over the past 30Ã‚Â years concerning the importance of prenatal and early childhood development: Preventive interventions are needed early in life because physical and psychological problems during pregnancy and early childhood often lead to serious physical, psychological, educational, and social problems throughout the life course. These problems are also transmitted to the next generation. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have increased the number of families who need these early-life preventive interventions. Without intensive support, children from high-risk families are likely to fail in school, to have serious physical and mental health problems, and to reproduce another generation of children with similar physical, cognitive, and mental health problems. We underline the needÃ‚Â to: (1) assess the extent of the COVID-19 damage on pregnant women and on their spouses, as well as on the families with preschool children; (2) help service providers identify the state-of-the art services they should implement; (3) assess the implementation of these services; and (4) help service providers maintain highly effective interventions. For the next 20 to 30Ã‚Â years at least, governments will be under intense pressure to invest massively in the health and care of the baby boomers. We are thus facing abysmal health care and retirement costs for the next 3 decades. Governments should be pressured to substantially invest in the support of pregnant women and preschool children, rather than in the sustained quality of life of the aging baby boomers.

"Understanding and attenuating pandemic-related disruptions: a plan to reduce inequalities in child development","The Secretary General of the United Nations described the impact of COVID-19-related school closures as a ""generational catastrophe."" What will be the legacy of the 2020-2021 pandemic-related disruptions in 5, 10, 20Ã‚Â years from now, as regards education and well-being of children and youth? Addressing the disproportionate impact on those growing up in socio-economically disadvantaged areas or on those with pre-existing learning challenges is key to sustainable recovery. This commentary builds on the four literature reviews presented in this Special Section on a Pandemic Recovery Plan for Children and proposes strategies to understand and attenuate the impact of pandemic-related lockdown measures. Importantly, we need a monitoring strategy to assess indicators of child development in three areas of functioning: education and learning, health, and well-being (or mental health). Surveillance needs to begin in the critical prenatal period (with prenatal care to expectant parents), and extend to the end of formal high school/college education. Based on child development indicators, a stepped strategy for intervention, ranging from all-encompassing population-based health and education promotion initiatives to targeted prevention programs and targeted remedial/therapeutic interventions, can be offered. As proposed in the UN plan for recovery, ensuring healthy present and future generations involves a concerted and intensive intersectoral effort from the education, health, psychosocial services, and scientific communities.

"COVID-19 and the impacts on youth mental health: emerging evidence from longitudinal studies","Several experts have warned that the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated confinement measures may have taken a devastating toll on youth mental health. While the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly created important challenges for children and youth, these claims vastly rely on cross-sectional data collected during the pandemic, from which it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. In this commentary, we offer a critical appraisal of the evidence from emerging longitudinal studies spanning the pre- and intra-pandemic period with a focus on internalizing and externalizing disorders, suicidality, eating disorders and substance use. We also discuss important research considerations in the monitoring of the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health as well as promising interventions to help mitigate potential long-lasting consequences of this unprecedented public health crisis.

"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Depressive Symptoms Among Mizan-Tepi University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Depression is an extremely common and widespread problem among university students. A better understanding of the magnitude and determinants of depressive symptoms is required to create appropriate interventions for those groups. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depressive symptoms among Mizan-Tepi University students during the pandemic lockdown. From September 11th to September 25th, 2020, 779 Mizan-Tepi University students participated in this web-based cross-sectional study. The link was created with a Google Form, and the questionnaire was distributed to participants via e-mail, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other social media accounts. To determine the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms, both descriptive and inferential analyses were used. The chi-squared test of association and logistic regression were used to identify predictors of depressive symptoms among university students. We used (IBM) SPSS version 20 for all statistical analyses. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among university students was 39.5%. According to results of multivariable binary logistic regression, being female (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.339, 95%CI: 0.220-0.522), being an alcoholic (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.101, 95%CI: 1.452-3.041), smoking (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.088, 95%CI: 1.460-2.986), being quarantined for 14Ã‚Â days (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.775, 95%CI: 1.231-2.560), frequently using social media (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.510, 95%CI: 1.063-2.145), fearing COVID-19 (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.058, 95%CI: 3.508-7.292), having sleeping problems (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.703, 95%CI: 1.051-2.760), having a family member infected with COVID-19 (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.829, 95%CI: 1.211-2.763), being exposed to COVID-19 (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.748, 95%CI: 1.114-2.743), monthly disposable incomeÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°501 ETB (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.531, 95%CI: 0.359-0.784), having a higher level of hope (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.158, 95%CI:0.056-0.447), and having high social support (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.546, 95%CI: 0.374-0.797) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms among students. In this study, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be high among university students. Being an alcoholic, smoking, quarantined for 14Ã‚Â days, frequently using social media, fearing COVID-19, having sleep problems, having a family member infected with COVID-19, and being exposed to COVID-19 were all associated with an increased risk of developing depressive symptoms, while being a female, having a high level of disposable monthly income, hope, and social support decreased the risk of depressive symptoms among university students.

"Disruptions in Care for Medicare Beneficiaries With Severe Mental Illness During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Little is known about changes in care for individuals with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. To examine changes in mental health care during the pandemic and the use of telemedicine in outpatient care among Medicare beneficiaries with severe mental illness. This population-based cohort study included Medicare beneficiaries (age Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related disorders or bipolar I disorder. Care patterns during January to September 2020 for a cohort defined in 2019 were compared with those during January to September 2019 for a cohort defined in 2018. Start of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, defined as week 12 of 2020. Use of mental health-related outpatient visits, emergency department visits, inpatient care, and oral prescription fills for antipsychotics and mood stabilizers during 4-week intervals. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined whether the pandemic was associated with differential changes in outpatient care across patient characteristics. The 2019 cohort of 686Ã¢â‚¬Â¯214 individuals included 389Ã¢â‚¬Â¯245 (53.8%) women, 114Ã¢â‚¬Â¯073 (15.8%) Black and 526Ã¢â‚¬Â¯301 (72.8%) White individuals, and 477Ã¢â‚¬Â¯353 individuals (66.0%) younger than 65 years; the 2020 cohort of 723Ã¢â‚¬Â¯045 individuals included 367Ã¢â‚¬Â¯140 (53.5%) women, 106Ã¢â‚¬Â¯699 (15.6%) Black and 497Ã¢â‚¬Â¯885 (72.6%) White individuals, and 442Ã¢â‚¬Â¯645 individuals (64.5%) younger than 65 years. Compared with 2019, there were large decreases during the pandemic's first month (calendar weeks 12-15) in individuals with outpatient visits (265Ã¢â‚¬Â¯169 [36.7%] vs 200Ã¢â‚¬Â¯590 [29.2%]; 20.3% decrease), with antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medication prescription fills (216Ã¢â‚¬Â¯468 [29.9%] vs 163Ã¢â‚¬Â¯796 [23.9%]; 20.3% decrease), with emergency department visits (12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯383 [1.7%] vs 8503 [1.2%]; 27.7% decrease), and with hospital admissions (11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯564 [1.6%] vs 7912 [1.2%]; 27.9% decrease). By weeks 32 to 35 of 2020, utilization rebounded but remained lower than in 2019, ranging from a relative decrease of 2.5% (outpatient visits) to 12.9% (admissions). During the full pandemic period (weeks 12-39) in 2020, 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯556Ã¢â‚¬Â¯403 of 2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯743Ã¢â‚¬Â¯553 outpatient visits (56.7%) were provided via telemedicine. In multivariable analyses, outpatient visit use during weeks 12 to 25 of 2020 was lower among those with disability (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.96), and during weeks 26 to 39 of 2020, it was lower among Black vs non-Hispanic White individuals (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99) and those with dual Medicaid eligibility (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98). In this cohort study, despite greater use of telemedicine, individuals with severe mental illness experienced large disruptions in care early in the pandemic. These narrowed but persisted through September 2020. Disruptions were greater for several disadvantaged populations.","Busch, Huskamp, Raja, Rose, Mehrotra","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.45677","20220128","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26243,""

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interview transcripts were analyzed by thematic analysis resulting in major themes. Participants (n = 32) were women who had given birth on or after March 13, 2020. Of the participants, 34% experienced depression, 46% experienced mild to moderate anxiety, and 28% experienced severe anxiety symptoms. Four major themes emerged: expectations versus reality, early versus late COVID-19 experience, mental distress versus mental health, and healthcare policy versus COVID-19 confusion. Experiences varied based upon geographical location, parity, and proximity to support. Short and long-term effects of COVID-19 on participants and their families were recognized. It is important to acknowledge the confusion experienced in many aspects of the birthing experience due to developing or conflicting pandemic or popular media information. Aligning expectations through providing clear, up-to-date information is helpful in decreasing mental distress. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 highlighted the critical need for professional and focused familial support and follow-up for women experiencing pregnancy-related mental health symptoms.","Saleh, Canclini, Greer, Mathison, Combs, Dickerson, Collins","https://doi.org/10.1097/JPN.0000000000000624","20220128","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26244,""
"Problematic Internet Use Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Youth in Outpatient Mental Health Treatment: App-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","Youth with existing psychiatric illness are more apt to use the internet as a coping skill. Because many ""in-person"" coping skills were not easily accessible during the COVID-19 pandemic, youth in outpatient mental health treatment may have been particularly vulnerable to the development of problematic internet use (PIU). The identification of a pandemic-associated worsening of PIU in this population is critical in order to guide clinical care; if these youth have become dependent upon the internet to regulate their negative emotions, PIU must be addressed as part of mental health treatment. However, many existing studies of youth digital media use in the pandemic do not include youth in psychiatric treatment or are reliant upon cross-sectional methodology and self-report measures of digital media use. This is a retrospective cohort study that used data collected from an app-based ecological momentary assessment protocol to examine potential pandemic-associated changes in digital media youth in outpatient mental health treatment. Secondary analyses assessed for differences in digital media use dependent upon personal and familial COVID-19 exposure and familial hospitalization, as well as factors associated with PIU in this population. The participants were aged 12-23 years and were receiving mental health treatment in an outpatient community hospital setting. All participants completed a 6-week daily ecological momentary assessment protocol on their personal smartphones. Questions were asked about depression (PHQ-8 [8-item Patient Health Questionnaire]), anxiety (GAD-7 [7-item General Anxiety Disorder]), PIU (PIU-SF-6 [Problematic Internet Use Short Form 6]), digital media use based on Apple's daily screen time reports, and personal and familial COVID-19 exposure. The analyses compared screen time, psychiatric symptoms, and PIU between cohorts, as well as between youth with personal or familial COVID-19 exposures and those without. The analyses also assessed for demographic and psychiatric factors associated with clinically significant PIU-SF-6 scores. A total of 69 participants completed the study. The participants recruited during the pandemic were significantly more likely to meet the criteria for PIU based on their average PIU-SF-6 score (P=.02) and to spend more time using social media each day (P=.049). The overall amount of daily screen time did not differ between cohorts. Secondary analyses revealed a significant increase in average daily screen time among subjects who were exposed to COVID-19 (P=.01). Youth with clinically significant PIU-SF-6 scores were younger and more likely to have higher PHQ-8 (P=.003) and GAD-7 (P=.003) scores. No differences in scale scores or media use were found between subjects based on familial COVID-19 exposure or hospitalization. Our findings support our hypothesis that PIU may have worsened for youth in mental health treatment during the pandemic, particularly the problematic use of social media. Mental health clinicians should incorporate screening for PIU into routine clinical care in order to prevent potential familial conflict and subsequent psychiatric crises that might stem from unrecognized PIU.","Gansner, Nisenson, Lin, Pong, Torous, Carson","https://doi.org/10.2196/33114","20220128","COVID-19; app; change; cohort; ecological momentary assessment; internet; mental health; outpatient; pilot; problematic internet use; teenager; treatment; young adult; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26245,""
"The prevalence and severity of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction in hemodialysis patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and severity of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction in hemodialysis patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 84 hemodialysis patients were evaluated in terms of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Poor sleep quality (79.8%) and poor mental health status (62.7%) and higher likelihood of having depression (31.0 vs. 61.9%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were noted. The IIEF-5 (10.5(5-25) vs. 7.5(5-23), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and FSFI (12(4-78) vs. 6(4-66), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) scores were significantly decreased during the pandemic with an increase in the likelihood of having erectile dysfunction (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Psychometric properties of The COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions in patients with pre-existing medical conditions","Fear of COVID-19 can have adverse mental health consequences in vulnerable patients with pre-existing conditions. We aimed to validate The COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions in Lithuania and to evaluate fears of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing conditions. Between October and December, 2020, 371 respondents with pre-existing conditions completed an online survey including the 10-item COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions (COVID-19 fears), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8; depressive symptoms), Generalised Anxiety Disorders-7 (GAD-7; anxiety symptoms) and Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R; posttraumatic stress symptoms). The majority of participants were women (84%) and from 41 to 60Ã‚Â years old (46%). The most common pre-existing conditions were respiratory diseases (33%) and diabetes (22%). Mean total score on the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire was 24.89Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 8.79. Exploratory factor analysis yielded one-factor solution with the Cronbach's coefficient alpha of 0.913. The highest rated COVID-19 fears were infection of close people, inability to receive treatment for COVID-19 and pre-existing condition and fear of severe complications because of the pre-existing condition. There was moderate to strong correlation of the 10-item COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions score with scores on the PHQ-8 (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.371), GAD-7 (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.358) and IES-R (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.553; all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Test-retest reliability was adequate. The 10-item COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions has good psychometric properties in patients with pre-existing conditions and greater fear is associated with worse mental health. Consideration of COVID-19 fears is important for optimised care of patients with pre-existing during the pandemic.","Buneviciene, Bunevicius, Bagdonas, Bunevicius","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13730","20220128","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fear","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26247,""
"A longitudinal investigation of psychological distress in children during COVID-19: the role of socio-emotional vulnerability","Although the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of distress in youth, some children show increased resilience, emphasizing the need to better understand the predictors of distress in youth. This longitudinal study aimed to assess the combined impact of known socio-emotional predictors of stress-related psychopathology, namely anxiety sensitivity, anxiety trait, intolerance to uncertainty, and rumination, on COVID-related distress in healthy youth. A total of 92 parent-child dyads that previously participated in a laboratory-based experiment assessing observational fear learning in families between 2017 and 2019 (T0) were recontacted. Of them, 84 children aged between 9 and 14 agreed to participate. They completed online questionnaires in June 2020 (T1), September 2020 (T2), December 2020 (T3), and March 2021 (T4). Participants were free of mental illness at T0 and T1. To create a socio-emotional composite score (SECS), we measured anxiety sensitivity (Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index) at T0, trait anxiety (Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C)), intolerance to uncertainty (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children), and trait rumination (Children's Response Style Scale) at T1 and created a weighted z-score. To assess symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress (PTS), and depression in reaction to COVID-19, participants completed the State subscale of the STAI-C, the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale, and the Children's Depression Inventory at T1-T4. Three general linear models were run with sex, age group (9-11 and 12+ years old), and SECS as predictors. Analyses revealed a SECS*Time interaction, with higher SECS predicting elevated anxiety symptoms at T1 and T4, and elevated PTS symptoms at T1 and T2. These results suggest that healthy youth endorsing high levels of socio-emotional vulnerability to psychopathology have a higher risk of suffering from anxiety and PTS, but not depressive symptoms, in the year following a major stressor. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Aunque la pandemia de COVID-19 ha aumentado la incidencia de angustia en jÃƒÂ³venes, algunos niÃƒÂ±os muestran una mayor resiliencia, relevando la necesidad de comprender mejor los predictores de la angustia en los jÃƒÂ³venes.<b>Objetivo:</b> Este estudio longitudinal tuvo como objetivo evaluar el impacto combinado de los predictores socioemocionales conocidos de la psicopatologÃƒÂ­a relacionada con el estrÃƒÂ©s, como son la sensibilidad a la ansiedad, rasgos ansiosos, intolerancia a la incertidumbre y rumiaciÃƒÂ³n, en la angustia relacionada con COVID en jÃƒÂ³venes sanos.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> 92 dÃƒÂ­adas de padres e hijos que participaron previamente en un experimento de laboratorio que evaluÃƒÂ³ el aprendizaje del miedo observacional en familias entre 2017 y 2019 (T0) fueron contactados nuevamente. Participaron 84 niÃƒÂ±os de entre 9 y 14 aÃƒÂ±os. Completaron cuestionarios en lÃƒÂ­nea en junio de 2020 (T1), septiembre de 2020 (T2), diciembre de 2020 (T3) y marzo de 2021 (T4). Los participantes estaban libres de enfermedad mental en T0 y T1. Para crear una puntuaciÃƒÂ³n socioemocional compuesta (SECS), medimos la sensibilidad a la ansiedad (ÃƒÂndice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad infantil) en T0, rasgo de ansiedad (subescala de rasgo del Inventario de ansiedad estado-rasgo para niÃƒÂ±os (STAI-C)), intolerancia a la incertidumbre (escala de intolerancia a la incertidumbre para niÃƒÂ±os) y rasgo de rumiaciÃƒÂ³n (Escala de estilo de respuesta en niÃƒÂ±os) en T1 y se creÃƒÂ³ una puntuaciÃƒÂ³n z ponderada. Para evaluar los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de ansiedad, estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (PTS) y depresiÃƒÂ³n en reacciÃƒÂ³n al COVID-19, los participantes completaron la subescala de estado de STAI-C, la escala de impacto de eventos para niÃƒÂ±os revisada, y el inventario de depresiÃƒÂ³n infantil en T1Ã¢â‚¬â€œT4. Se ejecutaron tres modelos lineales generales con sexo, grupo de edad (9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11 y 12+ aÃƒÂ±os) y SECS como predictores.<b>Resultados:</b> Los anÃƒÂ¡lisis revelaron una interacciÃƒÂ³n entre el tiempo y la puntuaciÃƒÂ³n socioemocional compuesta (SECS), donde un SECS mÃƒÂ¡s alto predice sÃƒÂ­ntomas de ansiedad elevados en T1 y T4, y sÃƒÂ­ntomas elevados de PTS (EstrÃƒÂ©s post traumÃƒÂ¡tico) en T1 y T2.<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n:</b> Estos resultados sugieren que la juventud sana que presenten altos niveles de vulnerabilidad socioemocional a la psicopatologÃƒÂ­a, tiene un mayor riesgo desufrir de ansiedad y sÃƒÂ­ndrome de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico, pero no sÃƒÂ­ntomas depresivos, en el aÃƒÂ±o siguiente a un evento estresante mayor. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯:</b> Ã¥Â°Â½Ã§Â®Â¡ COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã©Ââ€™Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Å½â€¡, Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Å½Â°Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã©Å¸Â§Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¥Â½Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â§Â£Ã©Ââ€™Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž:</b> Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§ÂºÂµÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Â·Â²Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¥ÂÂ³Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦â€¢ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Â¾Â, Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Â®Â¹Ã¥Â¿ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†Â, Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©Ââ€™Ã¥Â¹Â´COVID Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»Â¼Ã¥ÂË†Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢:</b> Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¨Ââ€Ã§Â³Â»Ã¤Âºâ€  92 Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¥Å Â Ã¨Â¿â€¡ 2017 Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¨â€¡Â³ 2019 Ã¥Â¹Â´ (T0) Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦ÂÂÃ¦Æ’Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã¥Â®Â¤Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂ²Ã¥Â­ÂÃ¤ÂºÅ’Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â»â€žÃ£â‚¬â€š 84 Ã¥ÂÂ 9 Ã¨â€¡Â³ 14 Ã¥Â²ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ’Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¥Å Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Å“Â¨2020Ã¥Â¹Â´6Ã¦Å“Ë† (T1), 2020Ã¥Â¹Â´9Ã¦Å“Ë† (T2), 2020Ã¥Â¹Â´12Ã¦Å“Ë† (T3) Ã¥â€™Å’2021Ã¥Â¹Â´3Ã¦Å“Ë† (T4) Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨ T0 Ã¥â€™Å’ T1 Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¦Â²Â¡Ã¦Å“â€°Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€“Â¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¥Â»ÂºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ§Â»Â¼Ã¥ÂË†Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€  (SECS), Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¤Âºâ€  T0 Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦â€¢ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦â‚¬Â§ (Ã¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦â€¢ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦Å’â€¡Ã¦â€¢Â°), Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜ (Ã¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â-Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨ (STAI-C) Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨), Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Â®Â¹Ã¥Â¿Â (Ã¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Â®Â¹Ã¥Â¿ÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨) Ã¥â€™Å’ T1 Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€°Â¹Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†Â (Ã¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã©Â£Å½Ã¦Â Â¼Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨), Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¥Â»ÂºÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥Å Â Ã¦ÂÆ’ zÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Â¯Â¹ COVID-19 Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜, Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬ (PTS) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶, Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨T1Ã¢â‚¬â€œT4Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€  STAI-C Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨, Ã¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¤Â¿Â®Ã¨Â®Â¢Ã§â€°Ë†Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€žÂ¿Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â»Â¥Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†Â«, Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ§Â»â€ž (9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11 Ã¥Â²ÂÃ¥â€™Å’ 12 Ã¥Â²ÂÃ¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¸Å ) Ã¥â€™Å’ SECS Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¥ÂËœÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¿ÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â€°Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“:</b> Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦ÂÂ­Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¤Âºâ€  SECS*Time Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¤Âºâ€™Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨, Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã©Â«ËœÃ§Å¡â€ž SECS Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹ T1 Ã¥â€™Å’ T4 Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«Ëœ, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ  T1 Ã¥â€™Å’ T2 Ã¦â€”Â¶ PTS Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº:</b> Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂºÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¥â€ â€¦, Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã©Â«ËœÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¨â€žâ€ Ã¥Â¼Â±Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’ PTS Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã©Â«Ëœ, Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¦Â²Â¡Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Raymond, Provencher, Bilodeau-Houle, Leclerc, Marin","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.2021048","20220128","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; post-traumatic stress; socio-emotional vulnerability; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26248,""
"Well-being of Canadian Veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional results from the COVID-19 Veteran well-being study","The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have disproportionally affected different population groups. Veterans are more likely to have pre-existing mental health conditions compared to the general Canadian population, experience compounded stressors resulting from disruptions to familial, social, and occupational domains, and were faced with changes in health-care delivery (e.g. telehealth). The objectives of this study are to assess (a) the mental health impact of COVID-19 and related life changes on the well-being of Veterans and (b) perceptions of and satisfaction with changes in health-care treatments and delivery during the pandemic. A total of 1136 Canadian Veterans participated in an online survey. Participants completed questions pertaining to their mental health and well-being, lifestyle changes, and concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as experiences and satisfaction with health-care treatments during the pandemic. Results showed that 55.9% of respondents reported worse mental health functioning compared to before the pandemic. The frequency of probable posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, and suicidal ideation were 34.2%, 35.3%, 26.8%, 13.0%, and 22.0%, respectively. Between 38.6% and 53.1% of respondents attributed their symptoms as either directly related to or exacerbated by the pandemic. Approximately 18% of respondents reported using telehealth for mental health services during the pandemic, and among those, 72.8% indicated a choice to use telehealth even after the pandemic. This study found that Veterans experienced worsening mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of telehealth services was widely endorsed by mental health treatment-seeking Veterans who transitioned to virtual care during the pandemic. Our findings have important clinical and programmeadministrator implications, emphasizing the need to reach out to support veterans, especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions and to enhance and maintain virtual care even post-pandemic. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Los impactos de la pandemia del COVID-19 han afectado de manera desproporcionada a diferentes grupos de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n.

La frecuencia de probable trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico, trastorno depresivo mayor, trastorno de ansiedad generalizada, trastorno por consumo de alcohol, e ideaciÃƒÂ³n suicida fue del 34,2%, 35,3%, 26,8%, 13,0% y 22,0%, respectivamente. Entre el 38,6% y el 53,1% de los encuestados atribuyeron sus sÃƒÂ­ntomas como directamente relacionados con la pandemia o agravados por ella. Aproximadamente el 18% de los encuestados informÃƒÂ³ haber utilizado la telesalud para los servicios de salud mental durante la pandemia, y entre ellos, el 72,8% indicÃƒÂ³ que habÃƒÂ­a optado por utilizar la telesalud incluso despuÃƒÂ©s de la pandemia.<b>Conclusiones:</b> Este estudio encontrÃƒÂ³ que los Veteranos experimentaron un empeoramiento de la salud mental como resultado de la pandemia del COVID-19. El uso de los servicios de telesalud fue ampliamente respaldado por los Veteranos en busca de tratamiento de salud mental que hicieron la transiciÃƒÂ³n a la atenciÃƒÂ³n virtual durante la pandemia. Nuestros hallazgos tienen importantes implicaciones clÃƒÂ­nicas y para los administradores de programas, enfatizando la necesidad de ayudar a los veteranos, especialmente a aquellos con condiciones de salud mental preexistentes, y de mejorar y mantener la atenciÃƒÂ³n virtual incluso despuÃƒÂ©s de una pandemia. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯:</b> COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¦Ë†ÂÃ¦Â¯â€Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Å Â Ã¦â€¹Â¿Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦â„¢Â®Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¤Â¼â€”Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¦Â¯â€, Ã©â‚¬â‚¬Ã¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦Å“â€°Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¥â€¦Ë†Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ Âµ, Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­, Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨ÂÅ’Ã¤Â¸Å¡Ã©Â¢â€ Ã¥Å¸Å¸Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€“Â­Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¤ÂÃ¥ÂË†Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂºÂ, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“ (Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¥Â¦â€šÃ¨Â¿Å“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”) Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â° (a) COVID-19 Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Â´Â»Ã¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©â‚¬â‚¬Ã¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Â¹Â¸Ã§Â¦ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ  (b) Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã¤Â»ËœÃ¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Å“â€¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢:</b> Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¦Å“â€° 1136 Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å Â Ã¦â€¹Â¿Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã©â‚¬â‚¬Ã¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¸Ã§Â¦ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸, Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Â´Â»Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Â¼ÂÃ¦â€Â¹Ã¥ÂËœ, COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â¿Â§Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½â€œÃ©ÂªÅ’Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“:</b> Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã§Â¤Âº, 55.9% Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¨Â®Â¿Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦Â¯â€Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â·Â®Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â, Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â, Ã¥Â¹Â¿Ã¦Â³â€ºÃ¦â‚¬Â§Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â, Ã©â€¦â€™Ã§Â²Â¾Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ââ‚¬Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥Â¿ÂµÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©Â¢â€˜Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¤Â¸Âº 34.2%, 35.3%, 26.8%, 13.0% Ã¥â€™Å’ 22.0%Ã£â‚¬â€š 38.6% Ã¨â€¡Â³ 53.1% Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¨Â®Â¿Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â°â€ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥Â½â€™Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§â€ºÂ´Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Å Â Ã¥â€°Â§Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã§ÂºÂ¦ 18% Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¨Â®Â¿Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¨Â¿Å“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨Å½Â·Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡, Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­ 72.8% Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¥ÂÂ³Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¹Å¸Ã©â‚¬â€°Ã¦â€¹Â©Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¨Â¿Å“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº:</b> Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å½Â°, Ã§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½ COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦, Ã©â‚¬â‚¬Ã¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¦ÂÂ¶Ã¥Å’â€“Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿Å“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¦Â¸Â¡Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¨â„¢Å¡Ã¦â€¹Å¸Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¯Â»Ã¦Â±â€šÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã©â‚¬â‚¬Ã¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¹Â¿Ã¦Â³â€ºÃ¨Â®Â¤Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¥â€¦Â·Ã¦Å“â€°Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Ë†â€™Ã§Â®Â¡Ã§Ââ€ Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°, Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¤Â¼Â¸Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ¦ÂÂ´Ã¦â€°â€¹Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ©â‚¬â‚¬Ã¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂº, Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã©â€šÂ£Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Ë†Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©â‚¬â‚¬Ã¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂº, Ã¥ÂÂ³Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¹Å¸Ã¥Å Â Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¥â€™Å’Ã§Â»Â´Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¨â„¢Å¡Ã¦â€¹Å¸Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Ââ€ Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Richardson, St Cyr, Forchuk, Liu, Plouffe, Le, Gargala, Deda, Soares, Hosseiny, Smith, Dupuis, Roth, Bridgen, Marlborough, Jetly, Heber, Lanius, Nazarov","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.2012374","20220128","COVID-19; Veterans; mental health; telehealth; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26249,""

"Determinants of social health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults: the Rotterdam Study","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and accompanying lockdown restrictions impacted social life significantly. We studied associations of sociodemographic factors, mental and social health markers, and brain structure with social health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prospective longitudinal population-based cohort study. Community-dwelling inhabitants of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Repeated questionnaires including questions on social health were sent to Rotterdam Study participants from April 2020 onwards. Social health data at study baseline were available for 5017 participants (mean age: 68.7 Ã‚Â± 11.3; 56.9% women). Determinants were assessed in routine Rotterdam Study follow-up (1990-2020), including global brain volumes in a subset of participants (N = 1720). We applied linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations to quantify associations between determinants and trajectories of loneliness, perceived social isolation and social connectedness over three time points from April 22nd to July 31st 2020. Loneliness prevalence was 27.9% in April 2020 versus 12.6% prepandemic. Social isolation (baseline mean 4.7 Ã‚Â± 2.4) and loneliness scores (baseline mean 4.9 Ã‚Â± 1.5) decreased over time, whereas social connectedness trajectories remained stable. Depressive symptoms, female sex, prepandemic loneliness, living alone, and not owning a pet were independently associated with lower social connectedness and higher social isolation and loneliness at COVID-19 baseline, but recovery of social health was similar for all determinants. Larger intracranial volume was associated with higher social connectedness. Despite baseline differences for specific determinants, older adults showed similar recovery of loneliness and social isolation alongside stable social connectedness over time during the pandemic. Social health is multidimensional, especially during a global health crisis.","van der Velpen, Melis, Hussainali, Perry, Vernooij-Dassen, Ikram, Luik, Vernooij","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002891","20220128","COVID-19; epidemiology; imaging; loneliness; longitudinal analyses; mental wellbeing; social health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26251,""

"Emerging mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic among presumably resilient youth -a 9-month follow-up","The COVID-19 pandemic may have multifarious adverse effects on the mental health of some youth. To our knowledge, no study has followed young people beyond the first 6 months of the pandemic outbreak. The aim of this study was to examine 1) Change in internalizing, externalizing, and total mental health problems over two time-points with a nine-month interval during the COVID-19 outbreak and 2) Whether contextual and COVID-19-related factors contribute to change in mental health problems. Youth within the municipality of Bergen aged 11-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°years were invited via SMS to participate in an online survey in April and again in December 2020. A total of 2997 (40% response rate) youth participated at baseline in the present study, and 1598 (53.3%) completed the second survey. At baseline, the mean age was 16.0 (standard deviations 1.7) years, about 60% were girls, and 93% were born in Norway. Comparison across time was approached using inferential statistics and mixed linear models with maximum likelihood estimation and mixed-effects logistic regression models. There was an overall increase in total mental health problems from the first weeks into lockdown to 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the pandemic outbreak. The overall increase seems to be exclusively driven by internalizing difficulties, i.e., increases in emotional problems and peer problems. The level of externalizing difficulties, i.e., conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention remained stable between the two time-points. Our results imply that in the wake of the pandemic, one should be aware of emerging mental health problems among presumably resilient youth, in addition to the more expected and pronounced mental health needs of vulnerable groups. Efforts to reach out to the general youth population with preventive measures in schools may be important actions to normalize the situation for young people, and toÃ‚Â identify those in need of more targeted mental health interventions.","Lehmann, Skogen, Sandal, Haug, BjÃƒÂ¸rknes","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03650-z","20220128","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26253,""
"Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome in patients after 12 months from COVID-19 infection in Korea","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to progress, awareness about its long-term impacts has been growing. To date, studies on the long-term course of symptoms, factors associated with persistent symptoms, and quality of life after 12Ã‚Â months since recovery from acute COVID-19 have been limited. A prospective online survey (First: September 8, 2020-September 10, 2020; Second: May 26, 2021-June 1, 2021) was conducted on recovered patients who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 13, 2020 and March 13, 2020 at Kyungpook National University Hospital. Responders aged between 17 and 70Ã‚Â years were included in the study. Overall, 900 and 241 responders were followed up at 6 and 12Ã‚Â months after recovery from COVID-19 in the first and second surveys, respectively. Clinical characteristics, self-reported persistent symptoms, and EuroQol-5-dimension (EQ5D) index score were investigated for evaluating quality of life. The median period from the date of the first symptom onset or COVID-19 diagnosis to the time of the survey was 454 (interquartile range [IQR] 451-458) days. The median age of the responders was 37 (IQR 26.0-51.0) years, and 164 (68.0%) responders were women. Altogether, 11 (4.6%) responders were asymptomatic, and 194 (80.5%), 30 (12.4%), and 6 (2.5%) responders had mild, moderate, and severe illness, respectively. Overall, 127 (52.7%) responders still experienced COVID-19-related persistent symptoms and 12 (5.0%) were receiving outpatient treatment for such symptoms. The main symptoms were difficulty in concentration, cognitive dysfunction, amnesia, depression, fatigue, and anxiety. Considering the EQ5D index scores, only 59.3% of the responders did not have anxiety or depression. Older age, female sex, and disease severity were identified as risk factors for persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms. COVID-19-related persistent symptoms improved over time; however, neurological symptoms can last longer than other symptoms. Continuous careful observation of symptom improvement and multidisciplinary integrated research on recovered COVID-19 patients are required.","Kim, Bitna-Ha, Kim, Chang, Kwon, Bae, Hwang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07062-6","20220128","COVID-19; Long COVID; Persistent symptoms; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2; Sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26254,""

"The Trend of Psychiatric Visits and Psychiatric Medication Prescription Among People Tested for SARS-CoV-2 During the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea","The objective of this study was to monitor the trend of psychiatric visits and medication prescriptions among people tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the initial phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Korea. We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) linked to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) data. The overall trend of psychiatric visits during COVID-19 for each month was compared to the month prior to COVID-19. The number of psychiatric medication prescription records was monitored from January 2019 to May 2020. A total of 212,678 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January 2020 and May 2020. Among these individuals, 72.1% (n=153,309) did not have pre-existing mental illness, and 27.9% (n=59,369) had pre-existing mental illness. We found that most psychiatric visits were made in March, and patients without pre-existing mental illness significantly increased in psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic (p trend&lt;0.001). In addition, psychiatric medication prescriptions were the most prescribed between March and April 2020. We identified a rising trend in psychiatric visits and medication prescriptions among people who were tested for SARSCoV-2 during the initial phase of COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.","Kim, Rim, Jo, Lee, Park","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0247","20220128","COVID-19; Inpatient; Mental health; Outpatient; South Korea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26256,""

"A qualitative exploration of the psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on Irish university students","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has caused significant mental health challenges across various populations but the psychological impact on university students, who represent a population particularly vulnerable to psychological distress, are yet to be understood. Using a socio-ecological lens, this qualitative research used online interviews to explore university studentsâ€™ experience of COVID-19 lockdown and the psychological impact of these measures. Coping strategies used by students to deal with these circumstances were also identified. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 Irish students during the third wave of COVID-19 (January 2021) and the strictest lockdown measures. Thematic analysis identified three themes which highlighted how students were â€˜negotiating changeâ€™ (theme 1), both in terms of lifestyle, academic life and social interactions. As a result of these major shifts in lifestyle, many experienced â€˜feelings of lossâ€™ (theme 2) at an intrapersonal, interpersonal and organisational level. Despite these challenging experiences of change and loss, participants also reflected on the positive aspects of lockdown, such as personal growth and improved social and family relationships (theme 3). Close relationships, goal setting, and self-care were identified as key coping strategies. These findings expands existing research on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the important role of third level institutions in promoting studentsâ€™ self-efficacy and personal development along with academic achievement.","Abigale Owens et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E020A-5E3-E0C","20220129","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; socio-ecological model; university students; covid-19; psychological wellbeing; lockdown; online education","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-29","",26258,""
