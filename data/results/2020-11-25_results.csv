"Nurses' burnout and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical and mental health of the nurses is greatly challenged since they work under unprecedented pressure and they are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of the disease. Aim: To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses' burnout and to identify associated risk factors. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and pre-print services (medRxiv and PsyArXiv) were searched from January 1, 2020 to November 15, 2020 and we removed duplicates. We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity between results was very high. Findings: Fourteen studies, including 17,390 nurses met the inclusion criteria. Five standardized and valid questionnaires were used to measure burnout among nurses; Maslach Burnout Inventory, Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Professional Quality of Life Scale version 5, Mini-Z, and Spanish Burnout Inventory. The overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.5-46.6%), of depersonalization was 12.6% (95% CI: 6.9-19.7%), and of lack of personal accomplishment was 15.2% (95% CI: 1.4-39.8%). The following factors were associated with increased nurses' burnout: younger age, higher educational level, higher degree, decreased social support, having a relative/friend diagnosed with COVID-19, low family and colleagues readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of Covid-19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high-risk environment (a COVID-19 designated hospital, a COVID-19 unit, etc.), working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, decreased working safety while caring for COVID-19 patients, increased workload, decreased self-confidence in self-protection, and lower levels of specialized training regarding COVID-19, job experience, and self-confidence in caring for COVID-19. Conclusion: Nurses experience high levels of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, while several sociodemographic, social, and occupational factors affect this burnout. Several interventions need to be implemented to mitigate mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses, e.g. screening for mental health illness and early supportive interventions for high-risk nurses, immediate access to mental health care services, social support to reduce feelings of isolation, sufficient personal protective equipment for all nurses to provide security, etc. Governments, health care organizations, and policy makers should act in this direction to prepare health care systems, individuals, and nurses for a better response against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Petros A Galanis; Irene Vraka; Despoina Fragkou; Angeliki Bilali; Daphne Kaitelidou","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20237750","20201125","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7453,""
"The experience of distress during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-country examination on the fear of COVID-19 and the sense of loneliness","Objectives To examine gender, age and cross-country differences in fear of COVID-19 and sense of loneliness during the lockdown, by comparing people from countries with a high rate of infections and deaths (i.e. Spain and Italy) and from countries with a mild spread of infection (i.e. Croatia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina). Methods A total of 3876 participants (63% female) completed an online survey on Everyday life practices in COVID-19 time in April 2020, including measures of fear of COVID-19 and loneliness. Results Males and females of all age groups in countries suffering from a strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reported higher fear of COVID-19 and sense of loneliness. In less endangered countries females and elder stated more symptoms than males and younger; in Spanish and Italian sample the pattern of differences is considerably more complex. Conclusion Future research should thoroughly examine different age and gender groups. The analysis of emotional well-being in groups at risk of mental health issues can help to lessen the long term social and economic costs due to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Gianluca Lo Coco; Ambra Gentile; Ksenija Bosnar; Ivana Milovanovic; Antonino Bianco; Patrik Drid; Sasa Pisot","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20237586","20201124","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7454,""
"Burnout and its factors in healthcare workers involved in providing health care for patients with COVID-19 at different stages of the pandemic","In the context of the pandemic, when healthcare professionals are forced to work under extreme stress and an increased threat of infection, research on professional burnout and emotional maladjustment of medical workers is gaining particular relevance around the world  AIM Of stUDy To assess the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, professional burnout and emotional distress among the employees of the N V  Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, providing care to patients with COVID-19 in the current period (July)  To compare them with the indicators of a mixed sample of medical workers from different institutions and regions surveyed in the first months of the pandemic (Marchâ€“April), and also to highlight the main factors of distress and protective factors  MAteRIAl AnD MetHODs The research methods were combined into a Google form, and participation in the research was anonymous  Of the 175 people who were sent questionnaires, filled out the form completely 120 people (69% samples), of which 43 men and 77 women, 54 2% were doctors of different specialties;40% were nurses, the rest of the categories accounted for 5 8% of the sample  The mean age of the respondents was 36 1 years (from 21 to 61 years)  ResUlts The data obtained on the indicators of mental distress are generally consistent with international data: 8 3% of the surveyed demonstrate symptoms of depression of moderate and severe severity according to the Beckâ€™s Depression Scale;6 7 % noted the presence of suicidal thoughts;29 3% had symptoms of anxiety of moderate and high severity according to the Beckâ€™s Anxiety Scale  And 35% had high level of emotional exhaustion according to the Maslach Burnout Inventory  Nevertheless, the data obtained indicate a greater mental well-being of employees of the N V  Sklifosovsky Research Institute in comparison with a mixed sample of specialists surveyed in March - April  The limitations of such a comparison are indicated, which are associated with differences in organizational affiliation and the composition of specialists  Anxiety for family members (noted by 54 7%) and fear of infection (noted by 38 3%) were most often named as an important factor of distress in the entire sample of 120 people  The most significant protective factors (reducing the level of distress), noted by more than half of the employees, were information about the current situation and tasks from the management, support from family and colleagues, material incentives and the opportunity to take breaks for rest  Based on the data of the regression analysis, it is concluded that it is important to take measures for psychological relief, provide personnel with protective equipment, reduce the level of physical discomfort associated with the use of personal protective equipment and lack of sleep, explain to the staff the meaning of all measures and decisions taken, and collegial discussion of the organization of work  The quality of support from relatives, colleagues and administration helps maintain a sense of the importance of their profession and self-respect for themselves as a professional among medical personnel  Â© 2020 Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine  All rights reserved","Kholmogorova, A.

"From a Three-Legged Stool to a Three-Dimensional World: Integrating Rights, Gender and Indigenous Knowledge into Sustainability Practice and Law","â€œSustainable Developmentâ€ has come a long way since the World Commission on Environment and Development first popularized the term in 1987  Virtually everyone is now familiar with the term Sustainable Development, from states to multinational corporations, and from affluent communities in the Global North to impoverished communities in the Global South  It received a new lease of life in 2015 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  It is recognized that sustainable development requires an inter-disciplinary, multi-level, and bottom-up approach, and that this ideal is easy to state but difficult to operationalize  Pursuant to deliberations at an international workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which aimed at fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse experts and developing solutions for effective inclusion of women and youth in climate change response strategies, we propose an innovative, practical three-dimensional model that enhances sustainability theory and practice with cross-cutting integration of human rights, gender equity, and Indigenous and local knowledge  We evaluate the utility of the model in two ways: First, we analyze how the model informs current approaches to environmental sustainability and human wellbeing including the SDGs, agroecology, de-growth principles, and planetary health metrics  Then, we explore the feasibility and added value of the approach through seven case studies from Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Peru, CÃ´te Dâ€™Ivoire, and Aotearoaâ€”New Zealand  We conclude that the proposed model is congruent with current theory and practice  It builds on existing principles by identifying and addressing gaps  It enables practical action in a variety of settings and fosters a more integrated approach to sustainable wellbeing for humanity and our earth  We recommend continued development of this theoretical framework and related guidelines for program design, implementation and evaluation","Anonymous","https://doi.org/10.3390/su12229521","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Sustainability;12(22):9521, 2020.; Publication details: Sustainability;12(22):9521, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7458,""
"Psychological Health Issues Subsequent to SARS-Cov 2 Restrictive Measures: The Role of Parental Bonding and Attachment Style","Background: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe panic among people worldwide  In Italy, a nationwide state of alert was declared on January 31st, leading to the confinement of the entire population from March 11 to May 18, 2020  Isolation and quarantine measures cause psychological problems, especially for individuals who are recognized as being vulnerable  Parental bonding and attachment styles play a role in the programming of the stress response system  Here, we hypothesize that the response to restricted social contact and mobility due to the pandemic has detrimental effects on mental-psychological health and that this relationship is, at least in part, modulated by parental bonding and attachment relationships that are experienced at an early age  Methods: A sample of 68 volunteer University students was screened for psychopathological symptoms (SCL-90-R and STAI-Y), stress perception (PSS), attachment style (RQ), and parental care and overcontrol (PBI) 6 months before the confinement  In the same subjects, psychopathological symptoms and stress perception were measured again during confinement  Results: Overall, psychological health and stress management deteriorated across the entire sample during confinement  Specifically, a significant increase in phobic anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and perceived stress was observed  Notably, parental bonding and attachment styles modulated the psychological status during the lockdown  Individuals with secure attachment and high levels of parental care (high care) showed increased levels of state anxiety and perceived stress in phase 2, compared with phase 1  In contrast, individuals with insecure attachment and low levels of parental care (low care) already showed a high rate of state anxiety and perceived stress in phase 1 that did not increase further during phase 2  Conclusion: The general deterioration of psychological health in the entire sample demonstrates the pervasiveness of this stressor, a decline that is partially modulated by attachment style and parental bonding  These results implicated disparate sensitivities to environmental changes in the high- and low care groups during the lockdown, the former of which shows the greatest flexibility in the response to environment, suggesting adequate and functional response to stress in high care individuals, which is not observable in the low care group  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Bussone, Pesca, Tambelli and Carola","Bussone, S.; Pesca, C.; Tambelli, R.; Carola, V.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589444","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7459,""
"Heightened Levels of Maladaptive Daydreaming Are Associated With COVID-19 Lockdown, Pre-existing Psychiatric Diagnoses, and Intensified Psychological Dysfunctions: A Multi-country Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading globally since December 2019, bringing with it anxieties, mortal risk, and agonizing psychological suffering  This study aimed to explore the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming (MD)â€”an addictive mental behavior to vivid fantasy associated with distress and functional impairmentâ€”and forced COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and quarantine  Previous literature indicated that individuals employ MD for the regulation of distress and boredom, wish fulfillment, and entertainment experiences  The literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health identifies a flareup in psychological difficulties in the general population  In this study we explored the associations between the pandemic threat and mental health indices among individuals with MD  We surveyed 1,565 adults from over 70 countries who responded to calls for participants posted in online MD communities and other general social media sites  Probable MD was determined based on an empirically derived cut-off score on a pertinent measure  After controlling for sociodemographic variables, a series of MANCOVAs, followed by post-hoc ANCOVAs, revealed that individuals with probable MD who were observing lockdown restrictions reported having spent more time in fantasy, experienced more intense and vivid daydreaming, and had a stronger urge to daydream than other participants  Similar statistical procedures indicated that, individuals with probable MD who reported pre-existing anxiety and depression disorders described a greater urge to daydream due to the pandemic and greater difficulty to control this addictive behavior  Compared to individuals with likely normal daydreaming, individuals with suspected MD reported more pandemic-attributed deterioration on a wide array of psychological distress indices  Our data show that the current worldwide pandemic threat is connected with an elevated intensity of this addictive form of mental activity, and that MD is associated with the exacerbation of psychological distress and dysfunction rather than with beneficial regulation of the experienced stressor  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Somer, Abu-Rayya, Schimmenti, Metin, Brenner, Ferrante, GÃ¶Ã§men and Marino","Somer, E.; Abu-Rayya, H.

"Resilience Contributes to Low Emotional Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak Among the General Population in Italy","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak is severely affecting the overall mental health with unknown psychological consequences  Although a strong psychological impact is possible, scant evidence is available to date  Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress  This study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterized by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor  Methods: A total sample of 6,314 Italian people participated in this study  Participants were recruited between March 29 and May 04 2020 through an online survey  The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and the Resilience Scale (RS) were administered  Demographic data and lockdown related information were also collected  A correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between psychopathological domains and resilience  Three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables and the resilience as independent variable controlling for age, gender, and education  COVID-19 specific variables were also included in the three regression analyses  A further exploratory analysis was carried out to examine which aspects of resilience predict depression, anxiety, and stress  Results: The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 32% for depression, 24 4% for anxiety, and 31 7% for stress  The sample mean scores on depression, anxiety, and stress were higher than the normal scores reported in the literature  Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress  Results of regression analyses indicated that resilience was statically significant in predicting depression, anxiety, and stress  Geographic area of residence and infected acquaintances were also significant predictors  Regarding the resilience factors, results revealed that meaningfulness, perseverance, and equanimity were statistically significant in predicting all the DASS-21 scales  Conclusion: About a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress  The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being  These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Lenzo, Quattropani, Musetti, Zenesini, Freda, Lemmo, Vegni, Borghi, Plazzi, Castelnuovo, Cattivelli, Saita and Franceschini","Lenzo, V.; Quattropani, M.

"Canada: health system review","This analysis of the Canadian health system reviews recent developments in organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health reforms and health system performance  Life expectancy is high, but it plateaued between 2016 and 2017 due to the opioid crisis  Socioeconomic inequalities in health are significant, and the large and persistent gaps in health outcomes between Indigenous peoples and the rest of Canadians represent a major challenge facing the health system, and society more generally  Canada is a federation: the provinces and territories administer health coverage systems for their residents (referred to as ""medicare""), while the federal government sets national standards, such as through the Canada Health Act, and is responsible for health coverage for specific subpopulations  Health care is predominantly publicly financed, with approximately 70% of health expenditures financed through the general tax revenues  Yet there are major gaps in medicare, such as prescription drugs outside hospital, long-term care, mental health care, dental and vision care, which explains the significant role of employer-based private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments  The supply of physicians and nurses is uneven across the country with chronic shortages in rural and remote areas  Recent reforms include a move towards consolidating health regions into more centralized governance structures at the provincial/territorial level, and gradually moving towards Indigenous self-governance in health care  There has also been some momentum towards introducing a national programme of prescription drug coverage (Pharmacare), though the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 may shift priorities towards addressing other major health system challenges such as the poor quality and regulatory oversight of the long-term care sector  Health system performance has improved in recent years as measured by in-hospital mortality rates, cancer survival and avoidable hospitalizations  Yet major challenges such as access to non-medicare services, wait times for specialist and elective surgical care, and fragmented and poorly coordinated care will continue to preoccupy governments in pursuit of improved health system performance","Marchildon, G.

"Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic period on depression, anxiety and stress levels of the healthcare employees in Turkey","The COVID-19 pandemic has turned into a public health issue since December 2019 and has risen in all countries in the world. The healthcare employees taking part in the pandemic will eventually be affected by the process. The aim of the study is to determine the levels of the anxiety, depression, and stress of the healthcare employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. As the data collection tool, an e-survey was used. In the first section, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used. In the second section of the survey, the problems experienced by the healthcare employees during the pandemic and their working media were aimed to be defined. In the last section, the socio-demographic features of the employees were investigated. 2076 healthcare employees participated in the study. The results showed that the major cause of the anxiety or stress among healthcare employees comes from the fear to contaminate the COVID-19 virus to their families (86.9%). It was observed that the levels of depression, anxiety and stress of female employees are higher than that of male employees (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.003). The highest depression, anxiety and stress levels of healthcare employees come from the pandemic, emergency, and internal services (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Health managers and policymakers need to make a move immediately to find solutions for the physical and psychological needs of the health employees. On the other hand, in order to minimize the risk, preparation of the work power plans beforehand and inclusion of obligatory referral chain into health services can be suggested.","TengilimoÃ„Å¸lu, ZekioÃ„Å¸lu, Tosun, IÃ…Å¸Ã„Â±k, TengilimoÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.legalmed.2020.101811","20201124","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare employee; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7476,""
"Depression and anxiety symptoms among returning workers during the COVID-19 period in East China","To determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated factors among returning workers with different epidemic experience in East China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2435 employees from the enterprises located in Deqing (low-risk epidemic area) and Taizhou (high-risk epidemic area) of East China in March 2020. An online questionnaire covered information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as knowledge, attitude, behavior and experience about COVID-19. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were applied to assess depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for depression and anxiety symptoms associated with risk factors. The participants were aged 36.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.2Ã‚Â years on average, and nearly half of them were female. Overall, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and both were 19.4%, 12.3% and 9.8%, and decreased with age. After adjustment for covariates, 16 or more years of education, being a white-collar worker or working in the high-risk epidemic area were significantly associated with increased risks of both depression and anxiety, in contract regular physical exercise was associated with decreased risks of both mental disorders. The depression and anxiety problems were prevalent among returning workers during the COVID-19 period. Targeted psychological interventions should be developed and implemented to improve their mental health.","Yang, Lin, Zhu, Chen, Wang, Zhao, Fu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01983-w","20201124","Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Depression; Returning worker","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7477,""
"Longitudinal changes in anxiety and psychological distress, and associated risk and protective factors during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic is related to multiple stressors and therefore may be associated with psychological distress. The aim of this study was to longitudinally assess symptoms of (un-)specific anxiety and depression along different stages of the pandemic to generate knowledge about the progress of psychological consequences of the pandemic and to test the role of potential risk and resilience factors that were derived from cross-sectional studies and official recommendations. The present study uses a longitudinal observational design with four waves of online data collection (from March 27 to June 15, 2020) in a convenience sample of the general population in Germany. A total of NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2376 participants that completed at least two waves of the survey were included in the analyses. Specific COVID-19-related anxiety and the average daily amount of preoccupation with the pandemic decreased continuously over the four waves. Unspecific worrying and depressive symptoms decreased on average but not on median level. Self-efficacy, normalization, maintaining social contacts, and knowledge, where to get medical support, were associated with fewer symptoms relative to baseline. Suppression, unhealthy habits, and a longer average daily time of thinking about the pandemic were correlated with a relative increase of symptoms. Our findings provide insight into the longitudinal changes of symptoms of psychological distress along the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Furthermore, we were able to reaffirm the anticipated protective and risk factors that were extracted from previous studies and recommendations.","Bendau, Plag, Kunas, Wyka, StrÃƒÂ¶hle, Petzold","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1964","20201124","Corona; Sars-CoV-2; depression; mental disorder; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7478,""

Data were collected via a telephone survey using a standardized script. Between March 1, 2020 and June 17, 2020, 28,903 people were tested at 4 Connecticut drive-through testing centers. Individuals who tested positive between March 16 and April 21, 2020 were randomly contacted. Of those individuals, 100 people agreed to complete the survey. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed. HCWs comprised 46% of the 100 survey respondents during the study period. Similarly, HCWs comprised 42.1% of all individuals who tested positive and listed an employer between March 1 and June 17, 2020. HCWs reported a longer duration of symptoms (17.39Ã‚Â vs 13.44 days) and were more likely to report work as their route of exposure (80.4%Ã‚Â vs 27.8%) than non-HCWs. HCWs may face a disproportionate risk of contracting COVID-19 and self-report a longer duration of symptoms than the general public.

It may also play an important role in the fear of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, the present study tested the mediating role of mindful awareness and humor (both identified as coping strategies for dealing with stressful situations) in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and hopelessness. Participants comprised 786 Turkish individuals (562 females and 224 males; aged between 18 and 67Ã‚Â years) from 71 of 81 cities in Turkey. An online convenience sampling method was used to recruit participants. Participants completed surveys including the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and Coping Humor Scale. The model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) and utilizing bootstrapping. The results of SEM showed that the effect of fear of COVID-19 on hopelessness was partly mediated by mindfulness and humor, and which was supported by bootstrapping. Therefore, higher fear of COVID-19 was associated with lower mindfulness and humor. In turn, lower mindfulness and humor were related with higher hopelessness.

This current review provides insights on how individuals, communities, and specific populations, such as healthcare workers and patients are leveraging pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 factors to reinforce their psychological resilience during the global public health crisis. Examination of the extant literature indicated that populations around the world rely often on support from their loved-ones, closed significant others, outdoor and physical activities, and spirituality to cope with the COVID-19-related distress. Increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 pandemic was also reported. A portion of publications provided intervention models to reinforce resilience among specific populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Autism and Access to Care During the COVID-19 Crisis","Brian is a 6-year-old boy who was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and global developmental delay at age 2. He has no other health conditions of note. Brian lives with his parents and an older brother, who also has ASD, in a rural area 2 hours from the center where he was diagnosed. Brian has a history of intermittent self-injurious behaviors (head-banging, throwing himself onto the floor, etc.) that regularly result in bruising, intense and lengthy tantrums, and aggression toward family and teachers. Brian will occasionally indicate items that he wants, but otherwise has no functional communication skills. Over the past 18 months, Brian's challenging behaviors have waxed and waned. The regional special education program is not equipped to safely manage his behaviors, and there are no in-home or center-based agencies that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) available. Brian's developmental pediatrician initiated guanfacine (eventually adding a small dose of aripiprazole) and referred the family to psychology for weekly telehealth behavioral parent training to address behavioral concerns using the Research Units in Behavioral Intervention curriculum.Brian's behavioral problems decreased during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, when he no longer had to leave home or attend special education. However, as summer continued, his behaviors worsened substantially (regular bruising and tissue damage, numerous after-hours consultations with his psychologist and developmental pediatrician, and one trip to the emergency department). The intensity of Brian's behaviors (maintained primarily by access to tangible items and escape from demands) made progress with behavioral supports slow and discouraging for his parents. Other psychosocial stressors coalesced for the family as well, including employment loss, limited social support because of social distancing requirements, and illness of one of his parents. The developmental pediatrician continued to modify the medication regimen over the summer, transitioning Brian from guanfacine to clonidine and increasing his aripiprazole incrementally (with clear increased benefit); hydroxyzine was also used as needed during the episodes of highest intensity.Despite the availability of best-practice guidelines for children with Brian's presenting concerns, a confluence of barriers (geographic, economic, ABA work force, global pandemic, etc.) present serious questions for his family and care team related to the next steps in Brian's care. Should he attend in-person school in the fall, knowing that the available program may have limited educational benefit and increase his risk of COVID-19 exposure (not to mention self-injury)? Would the potential benefits of cross-country travel to an intensive behavioral treatment program outweigh the associated psychosocial and economic stressors? How else can the virtual care team support this family?","Nadler, Godwin, Dempsey, Nyp","https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000000894","20201124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7484,""

"Convenience and comfort: reasons reported for using drugs alone among clients of harm reduction sites in British Columbia, Canada","North American communities are severely impacted by the overdose crisis, particularly in British Columbia (BC), which has the highest toxic drug overdose death rate in Canada. Most fatal overdoses in BC occurred among individuals using alone and in private residences. This study aimed to assess prevalence and reasons for using drugs alone among people accessing harm reduction services in BC. We recruited harm reduction supply distribution site clients from 22 communities across BC. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to describe factors associated with using alone. Thematic analysis of free-text responses providing reasons for using alone were grouped with survey data and additional themes identified. Overall, 75.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°314) of the study sample (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°414) reported using drugs alone within the last week. Those that reported using alone did not differ from those that did not by gender, age, urbanicity, or preferred drug use method. Among those that used alone, 73.2% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°230) used opioids, 76.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°241) used crystal meth, 41.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°130) used crack/cocaine, and 44.6% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°140) used alcohol in the past week. Polysubstance use involving stimulants, opioids, and/or benzodiazepines was reported by 68.5% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°215) of those that used alone. Additionally, 22.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°72) of those that used alone had experienced an opioid and/or stimulant overdose in the past 6Ã‚Â months. In a multivariable logistic regression model, having no regular housing and past week crack/cocaine use were associated with using alone (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.27; 95% CI 1.20-4.27 and AOR: 2.10; 95% CI 1.15-3.82, respectively). The most common reason reported for using alone was convenience and comfort of using alone (44.3%). Additional reasons included: stigma/hiding drug use (14.0%); having no one around (11.7%); safety (9.6%); and not wanting to share drugs with others (8.6%). Using drugs alone, particularly for convenience and comfort, is ubiquitous among people accessing harm reduction services. Overdose prevention measures that go beyond individual behaviour changes, including providing a safer supply of drugs and eliminating stigma, are paramount to mitigate harms. These interventions are especially necessary as emergence of coronavirus disease may further exacerbate unpredictability of illicit drug content and overdose risk.","Papamihali, Yoon, Graham, Karamouzian, Slaunwhite, Tsang, Young, Buxton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00436-6","20201124","Opioid; Overdose; Overdose crisis; Using alone; Using drugs alone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7486,""
"Caring for Patients' Reproductive Healthcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Abortion care requires supporting a patient through the decision to end a pregnancy, the process of having an abortion, and how to care for themselves after the decision is made. This process is nuanced in the best of times and has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides a foundation for clergy and mental health providers on some of the issues that patients will experience accessing abortion care, specifically during the pandemic.","Bass","https://doi.org/10.1177/1542305020962012","20201124","COVID; abortion; mental health; reproductive rights; support; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7487,""
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder-contamination fears, features, and treatment: novel smartphone therapies in light of global mental health and pandemics (COVID-19)","This review aims to shed light on the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with a focus on contamination fears. In addition, we will briefly review the current therapies for OCD and detail what their limitations are. A key focus will be on discussing how smartphone solutions may provide approaches to novel treatments, especially when considering global mental health and the challenges imposed by rural environments and limited resources; as well as restrictions imposed by world-wide pandemics such as COVID-19. In brief, research that questions this review will seek to address include: (1) What are the symptoms of contamination-related OCD? (2) How effective are current OCD therapies and what are their limitations? (3) How can novel technologies help mitigate challenges imposed by global mental health and pandemics/COVID-19.","Jalal, Chamberlain, Robbins, Sahakian","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1092852920001947","20201124","COVID-19.; ObsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive disorder; contamination fears; global mental health; smartphone therapies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7488,""
"The Italian Covid-19 Psychological Research Consortium ( IT C19PRC): General Overview and Replication of the UK study","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic represents a major stressor for the psychological health of people worldwide. In the UK, the Covid19-Psychological Research Consortium Study (C19PRC) launched to evaluate the psychological impact of Covid-19 in the general population and its implications. The project was then extended to Italy and several other countries. Purpose: this article provides an overview of the Italian C19PRC study and its replication of two specific findings from the UK C19PRC. In the first part, the relationship between anxiety and somatic symptomatology is examined. In the second part, we analyse the association between several factors and psychological health outcomes: depression/anxiety, traumatic stress, Covid-19 anxiety. Methods: in line with the study conducted in the UK, an online survey was administered to the adult Italian general population. The sample included 1038 respondents (age, mean = 49.94, SD = 16.14; 51.15% females) taken from four regions: Lombardia, Veneto, Lazio e Campania. The relationship between predictors and outcomes was evaluated by means of logistic regression models. Results: somatic indices showed a positive association with anxiety, worse somatic symptoms were associated with having had losses due to Covid-19 and with precarious health conditions. Females showed a higher incidence of psychological issues. No differences in anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress were found across regions but the Campania region showed the most severe somatic symptomatology. In the second analysis, the factors associated with more severe psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety and/or depression, traumatic stress, and Covid-19 Related Anxiety) were younger age, the presence of minors in the household, traumatic stressors, and precarious health conditions. No differences across regions emerged. Discussions and conclusions: The Italian results correspond to the UK findings for anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress 1. Both in the UK and Italy, the factors associated with worse psychological health were gender (female), younger age, having children, pre-existing health issues (both for oneself or someone close), and the moderate/high perceived risk of contracting Covid-19 within one month. In Italy, unlike the UK, lower household income and having (had) Covid-19 were not associated with poorer mental health. The psychological impact of Covid-19 can last for months; future research should explore all aspects of the psychological burden of Covid-19 in order to implement psychological interventions and promote psychological health.","Giovanni Bruno et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-2B7-75F","20201125","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7489,""
"A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping with COVID-19","Aim and Method: This perspective searches for evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of COVID-19. This narrative review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period on the characteristics of mature gratitude in association with good mental health. Results: The results from the COVID-19 period suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Characteristics of mature gratitude such as trait and state gratitude, and spirituality and the awareness of being part of a larger whole can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives right now due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Conclusion: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future. Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.","Lilian Jans-Beken","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA","20201125","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Narrative Research; clinical psychology; virtues; character strengths; corona; positive psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7490,""
"""No way out except from external intervention"": First-hand accounts of autistic inertia","This study, called for by autistic people and led by an autistic researcher, is the first to explore â€˜autistic inertiaâ€™, a widespread and often debilitating difficulty initiating action. Previous research has considered initiation only in the context of social interaction or experimental conditions. This study is unique in considering difficulty initiating tasks of any type in real life settings, and by gathering qualitative data directly from autistic people. Four face-to-face and 2 online (text) focus groups were conducted with 32 autistic adults (19 female, 8 male, 5 other), aged 23-64 who were able to express their internal experiences in words. They articulate in detail the actions they have difficulty with, what makes it easier or harder to act, and the impact on their lives. Thematic analysis of the transcripts found four overarching themes: descriptions of inertia, scaffolding to support action, the influence of wellbeing, and the impact on day-to-day activities. Participants described difficulty starting, stopping and changing activities that was not within their conscious control. While difficulty with planning was common, a subset of participants described a profound impairment in initiating even simple actions more suggestive of a movement disorder. Prompting and compatible activity in the environment promoted action, while mental health difficulties and stress exacerbated difficulties. Inertia had pervasive effects on participantsâ€™ day-to-day activities and wellbeing. This overdue research opens the door to many areas of further investigation to better understand autistic inertia and effective support strategies.","Karen Leneh Buckle et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-EFF-E43","20201125","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Neuropsychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurodevelopmental Disorders; autism; autistic adults; qualitative; asd; inertia; catatonia; movement; initiation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-25","",7491,""
