"Psychological impact amongst patients with COVID-19 in Perak state","Psychological distress had been documented since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019. The aim of the study is to describe the psychological impact among those who were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection within 6 months after being discharged from the hospital. The psychological impact in this study is defined as depression, anxiety, and stress. This was a cross-sectional study conducted from July 2020 till August 2021 in a regional state hospital, north of Malaysia. All patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 were approached within the first 2 weeks after admission to administer the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) scale. Follow-up phone calls were made within 3 months of discharged to enquire about the DASS-21 items as well as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scale items. Participants above the age of 18 and technology savvy to answer an online questionnaire were recruited for the study. We excluded participants with a known history of psychotic disorder from the study. We utilised the DASS-21 to screen for depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the IES-R to identify symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Participants could answer the questionnaires in either English or Bahasa Malaysia. For comparison of two categorical data, a chi-square was applied. A univariate analysis was first conducted and all variables with a p &#x2264;0.3 was then entered into the multivariate analysis for the final output. Other than the univariate analysis, all other p values &lt;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All data collected were tabulated and analysed in the SPSS v21.0 system. A total of 306 out of 696 COVID-19 patients responded. The mean age for the participants was 31.69 (SD:11.19) years old. From the total, 54.2% were ladies, 78.8% were Malay, 50.7% were unmarried, 55.2% had higher education, and 67.6% were employed at the time of the survey. We found 20.5% of the participants were depressed, 38.9% had moderate anxiety, and 17.3% were stressed. From the total, 31.7% of the participants were deemed to have had some symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ranging from mild to severe. From the final multivariate analysis, it was found that depression (p=0.02) had a 2.78 times likeliness of having PTSD, anxiety (p&lt;0.001) had a 3.35 times likeliness of having PTSD and stressed patients (p=0.02) 2.86 times likeliness of having PTSD when compared to those without PTSD. Patients reported to suffer from symptoms of PTSD and might benefit from psychological interventions to mitigate the impact in the long run.","Loo, Arvinder-Singh, Ang, Kong, Vikram Suarn, Rakesh","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+impact+amongst+patients+with+COVID-19+in+Perak+state.","20221130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41863,""
"Addressing HIV and Homelessness During COVID-19: A Community-Based Demonstration Project","People experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for HIV, and people with HIV (PWH) experiencing homelessness are more likely to experience suboptimal HIV health outcomes than PWH with stable housing. Within Alabama, a state prioritized in the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, Jefferson County consistently has the highest number of new HIV diagnoses as well as a high percentage of the state's homeless population. To address the twin epidemics of both HIV and homelessness within the high-priority setting of Jefferson County, Alabama, this 1-year community-based project, Ending the HIV Epidemic: Addressing HIV Health and Homelessness (AH3), sought to increase HIV testing and linkage to care among this population by placing a full-time case manager trained in HIV testing and case management at a homeless shelter. Results demonstrated that HIV testing was highly acceptable: 733 individuals were offered a test, and only 2.7% (n = 20) declined. Nine previously diagnosed, out of care PWH and one newly diagnosed PWH were identified through AH3 testing efforts. Of these, five (50%) were linked to care at a local HIV clinic. The remaining five PWH left the shelter before they could be linked to care. Just 10 shelter guests expressed interest in taking PrEP (just 1.4% of guests who tested negative for HIV), and only one of these linked to PrEP care. Future health promotion programs are needed to address mental health and other ancillary needs among this population, as well as programs that provide access to PrEP and other HIV prevention services.","Kay, Bruce, Foster-Hill, Rygiel, Batey","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399221135589","20221130","HIV/AIDS; access to health care; community organization; health promotion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41864,""
"Effect of an Online Mindfulness Course for Hospital Doctors During COVID-19 Pandemic on Resilience and Coping","Physicians' wellbeing is a priority to prevent increasing rates of poor mental health and burnout, exacerbated by caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. Structured mindfulness courses have been shown to be beneficial, but face-to-face delivery is not always feasible in the context of busy health services. Remotely delivered structured mindfulness courses could enable wider participation, particularly at time when social distancing to prevent infection transmission is necessary. Our objective was to test the feasibility of a remotely delivered structured mindfulness course for hospital doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a feasibility study run at one English hospital between January and March 2021, when COVID-19 admissions were at a high. Interested doctors participated in a 6-session remotely delivered mindfulness course. Sessions lasted 90&#x2009;min and could be attended on-line or the recording watched at later time. Main outcome measures were data on interest, course attendance and engagement, together with validated psychological outcome measures at baseline and follow-up after course completion. 20 doctors expressed interest to participate and 16 started the course. Of these, 12 completed at least 3 sessions (median&#x2009;=&#x2009;4); difficulty attending resulted from conflicting clinical commitments and rosters. Twelve participants completed the follow-up survey. They rated the course highly and all perceived it to have been useful, with statistically significant (<i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.01) improvements in wellbeing and mindfulness scores. They all stated that they would recommend this course to their colleagues and most (10/12) were interested in follow-up mindfulness sessions. Remotely delivered structured mindfulness training for hospital doctors was feasible, but there is a need to address the difficulties that affected attendance in order to optimize accessibility and completion of such programs.","Hanson, Villarreal, Khan, Dale, Sankar","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501319221138425","20221130","COVID-19; hospital physician; mindfulness; remote training; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41865,""
"Automatic detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray and lung computed tomography images using deep neural networks and transfer learning","The world has been undergoing the most ever unprecedented circumstances caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which is having a devastating global effect in different aspects of life. Since there are not effective antiviral treatments for Covid-19 yet, it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease, thereby helping to reduce mortality. While different measures are being used to combat the virus, medical imaging techniques have been examined to support doctors in diagnosing the disease. In this paper, we present a practical solution for the detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) and lung computed tomography (LCT) images, exploiting cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. As the main classification engine, we make use of EfficientNet and MixNet, two recently developed families of deep neural networks. Furthermore, to make the training more effective and efficient, we apply three transfer learning algorithms. The ultimate aim is to build a reliable expert system to detect Covid-19 from different sources of images, making it be a multi-purpose AI diagnosing system. We validated our proposed approach using four real-world datasets. The first two are CXR datasets consist of 15,000 and 17,905 images, respectively. The other two are LCT datasets with 2,482 and 411,528 images, respectively. The five-fold cross-validation methodology was used to evaluate the approach, where the dataset is split into five parts, and accordingly the evaluation is conducted in five rounds. By each evaluation, four parts are combined to form the training data, and the remaining one is used for testing. We obtained an encouraging prediction performance for all the considered datasets. In all the configurations, the obtained accuracy is always larger than 95.0%. Compared to various existing studies, our approach yields a substantial performance gain. Moreover, such an improvement is statistically significant.","Duong, Nguyen, Iovino, Flammini","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109851","20221130","AI Diagnosis systems; COVID-19; Chest X-ray image; Expert systems; Lung CT images","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41866,""
"Current Status and Associated Factors of Health Information Literacy Among the Community Elderly in Central China in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","COVID-19 posed a threat to the public's physical and mental health, and under outbreak control, the opportunities to go outside of the elderly have been reduced and making it more difficult to access health information and detrimental to their health management. This study aims to assess the current status of health information literacy (HIL) among older adults in the community in the context of COVID-19 and to identify its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April to July, 2021, for which 617 community elderly members were recruited in Chenzhou, China. Data were collected through a general information questionnaire, The Chinese residents' HIL self-rated scale and a reliability evaluation form. The average score of HIL was 75.87 &#xb1; 9.85, and after processed by the 100-point system, we found 84.12% (519/617) of the participants scored less than 60 points, which indicates that the overall level of HIL among the community elderly is low. Multiple linear regression showed that age, gender, education, annual family Income, living arrangement, and chronic disease status (&#x3b2; = -0.341, -0.296, 0.384, 0.327, 0.296, 0.356, respectively; all P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with the level of HIL found among the community elderly, out of which education was the most important associated factor. The overall HIL level among the community elderly was low in Central China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results further prove the need for tailor-made health education programs for this group, with particular attention paid to the low-educated and low-income among them. Those measures must highlight on three aspects of health information search, evaluation, and application skills to offer useful experiences that improve the HIL level of the elderly and strengthen their ability to cope with emerging public health events.","Li, Zhong, Chen, Qin, Meng","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S387976","20221130","COVID-19; awareness; community elderly; health information literacy; information skill; public health emergencies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41867,""
"Exploring the relationship between suicide vulnerability, impulsivity and executive functioning during COVID-19: A longitudinal analysis","Public health emergencies increase the presence and severity of multiple suicide risk factors and thus may increase suicide vulnerability. Understanding how suicide risk factors interact throughout the course of a global pandemic can inform how to help the most vulnerable groups in society. The aims of the research were to explore the associations between, and changes in, suicide vulnerability, COVID-related stress, worry, rumination, executive functioning and impulsivity across the first 6 weeks of UK lockdown (1st April - May 17, 2020). 418 adults in the UK completed an online survey at three time points during the first lockdown (Time 1 (April 1-5th), Time 2 (April 15-19th April), Time 3 (May 13-17th). Impulsivity and executive functioning remained stable across the first six weeks of UK lockdown. COVID-related stress, worry, and rumination decreased throughout the 6 weeks. Suicide vulnerability was associated with greater impulsivity and poorer executive functioning. Sub-group analysis revealed individuals vulnerable to suicide reported worse COVID-related stress, poorer executive function and greater impulsivity than individuals who reported no suicide vulnerability. Individuals vulnerable to suicide appear to have experienced poorer executive functioning, greater impulsivity and COVID-related stress in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rogerson, Prudenzi, O'Connor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2022.100088","20221130","COVID-19; Executive function; Impulsivity; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41868,""
"Reliability and validity of the post COVID-19 condition stigma questionnaire: A prospective cohort study","Many of the 10-20% percent of COVID-19 survivors who develop Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC, or Long COVID) describe experiences suggestive of stigmatization, a known social determinant of health. Our objective was to develop an instrument, the Post COVID-19 Condition Stigma Questionnaire (PCCSQ), with which to quantify and characterise PCC-related stigma. We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the reliability and validity of the PCCSQ. Patients referred to our Post COVID-19 Clinic in the Canadian City of Edmonton, Alberta between May 29, 2021 and May 24, 2022 who met inclusion criteria (attending an academic post COVID-19 clinic; age &#x2265;18 years; persistent symptoms and impairment at&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;12 weeks since PCR positive acute COVID-19 infection; English-speaking; internet access; consenting) were invited to complete online questionnaires, including the PCCSQ. Analyses were conducted to estimate the instrument's reliability, construct validity, and association with relevant instruments and defined health outcomes. Of the 198 patients invited, 145 (73%) met inclusion criteria and completed usable questionnaires. Total Stigma Score (TSS) on the PCCSQ ranged from 40 to 174/200. The mean (SD) was 103.9 (31.3). Cronbach's alpha was 0.97. Test-retest reliability was 0.92. Factor analysis supported a 6-factor latent construct. Subtest reliabilities were &gt;0.75. Individuals reporting increased TSS occurred across all demographic groups. Increased risk categories included women, white ethnicity, and limited educational opportunities. TSS was positively correlated with symptoms, depression, anxiety, loneliness, reduced self-esteem, thoughts of self-harm, post-COVID functional status, frailty, EQ5D5L score, and number of ED visits. It was negatively correlated with perceived social support, 6-min walk distance, and EQ5D5L global rating. Stigma scores were significantly increased among participants reporting employment status as disabled. Our findings suggested that the PCCSQ is a valid, reliable tool with which to estimate PCC-related stigma. It allows for the identification of patients reporting increased stigma and offers insights into their experiences. The Edmonton Post COVID-19 Clinic is supported by the University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services. No additional sources of funding were involved in the execution of this research study.","Damant, Rourke, Cui, Lam, Smith, Fuhr, Tay, Varughese, Laratta, Lau, Wong, Stickland, Ferrara","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101755","20221130","Health related stigma; Long COVID; PCC; Post COVID-19 condition; Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Stigma; Stigma as a social determinant of health; Stigmatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41869,""
"Urban park use and self-reported physical, mental, and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic: An on-site survey in Beijing, China","The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for people's health. Studies have demonstrated the positive impact of urban green spaces, particularly urban parks, on physical and mental health. However, few studies have evaluated social health, which is a component of human health, and more understanding of the relationship between urban parks and human health during the COVID-19 pandemic is required. This study examined the effects of urban parks on people's health using a canonical correlation model. Physical, mental, and social health were the dependent health variables, and five factors related to urban parks were the independent variables. This study investigated 22 urban parks inside the Forth Ring Road in Beijing, China using a questionnaire survey. The results demonstrated a positive association between urban parks and human health during the pandemic. Distance to the parks, park area, and park size were positively correlated with physical, mental, and social health. Furthermore, frequency and duration of visits to urban parks were positively associated with mental health and contact with neighbors. The health effects of urban park use varied with park types and locations' urbanization background. These findings can provide insights for health-oriented urban park planning and construction.","Lin, Sun, Yang, Han, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127804","20221130","COVID-19 pandemic; Self-reported well-being; Social health; Urban park; Urbanization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41870,""
"Does expert information affect citizens' attitudes toward corona policies? Evidence from Germany","Information provided by experts is believed to play a key role in shaping attitudes towards policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses a survey experiment to assess whether providing citizens with expert information about the health risk of COVID-19 and the economic costs of lockdown measures affects their attitudes towards these policies. Our findings show that providing respondents with information about COVID-19 fatalities among the elderly raises support for lockdown measures, while information about their economic costs decreases support. However, different population subgroups react differently. Men and younger respondents react more sensitively to information about lockdown costs, while women and older respondents are more susceptible towards information regarding fatality rates. Strikingly, our results are entirely driven by respondents who underestimate the fatality of COVID-19, who represent a majority.","Fuest, Immel, Neumeier, Peichl","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2022.102350","20221130","COVID-19; Corona; Germany; Lockdown; Pandemic; Survey experiment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41871,""
"Rates and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder and symptoms during the immediate onset of COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of patients from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Turkiye","This study was designed to investigate the traumatic stress levels, participants demonstrating higher than post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cutoff, thus PTSD possibility, levels, and related factors of patients who felt the need to apply to the outpatient clinic for the 1st time during the first period of the outbreak of the pandemic as a traumatic event, when many psychiatry outpatient clinics were mostly closed to face-to-face admissions. In our research, we targeted three objectives. First, we evaluated PTSD as indicated with measure cutoff points and post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) rates among the individuals who were admitted to an outpatient psychiatric clinic for the 1st time, 3 months after the first COVID-19 case was reported in Turkiye. Second, we investigated the relationship between PTSS and PTSD cutoff with anxiety, stress, depression, hopelessness, fear of COVID-19, and disability levels. Third, we aimed to explore the sociodemographic data and risk factors related to PTSD cutoff and PTSS controlling levels of disability, hopelessness, fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, and stress. For our study, a total number of 85 cases were recruited. Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS) were administered to each patient. The rates of possible PTSD and PTSSs were found to be 25.9% and 88.2%. The majority of participants were women (65.9%) who have been presenting complaints with anxiety symptoms (60.1%) and social media users (74.1%).

"Predictors of Perceived Stress and Quality of Life among Women during the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-sectional Study from Karaj, Iran","<b>Background:</b> The emergence of the coronavirus disease of the 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Iran has markedly affected lives and taken a toll on Iranians' mental health, especially in women. The current study investigated factors that contributed to both perceived stress and quality of life (Qol) among women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Karaj, Iran. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online survey study was conducted between November 30, 2020, and January 30, 2021. A researcher-made questionnaire with 4 subscales, including information seeking, social support, primary appraisal, and secondary appraisal, was used. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaires were also applied. A total of 581 participants completed the study. The convenience sampling method was used in this study. Multiple mediation analyses were applied using pathway analysis. <b>Results:</b> The mean age &#xb1; SD of the participants was 38.57&#xb1;7.68 years, and 40.8% had a higher education than a high school diploma. Based on the final fitted model, higher perceived stress had a direct impact on mental QoL (&#x3b2; = 0.47). The Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Incremental fit index (IFI), and Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) were calculated as 1, and &#x3c7;2/df was 4.87. Educational level and social support from both the direct and indirect pathway affected QoL. Social support affected both information-seeking behavior and secondary appraisal (&#x3b2; = 0.50: 95% CI, 0.38-0.59). Furthermore, information-seeking behavior and secondary appraisal affected perceived stress. Perceived stress followed by educational level had the strongest and primary appraisal had the poorest indirect association with mental QoL. <b>Conclusion:</b> In conclusion, primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, social support, educational level, perceived stress, and information-seeking behavior were correlated with higher levels of mental QoL among women. Social support and improving the situation appraisal can provide appreciated support to manage stress induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further assessment is needed to determine the vulnerable groups such as illiterate people.","Esmaelzadeh, Mahmoodi, Rajati, Salehi","https://doi.org/10.47176/mjiri.36.106","20221130","COVID-19; Iran; Quality of Life; Stress; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41873,""
"Religiousness in the First Year of COVID-19: A Systematic Review of Empirical Research","The COVID-19 pandemic emerged suddenly in early 2020, posing a serious health threat and creating tremendous stress and distress across the world. Religion has been shown to play important and varied roles in previous disasters and health crises, but its roles in the pandemic have yet to be outlined. We aimed to summarize the research conducted on religion and COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic with a systematic review of studies that specifically involved individual-level religiousness and COVID-19. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO covering a one-year period from the first published mention of the novel coronavirus (Jan. 5, 2020) through January 4, 2021. We included articles about COVID-19 that were peer-reviewed and empirical, measured and reported results on religion on an individual level, and were available in English. Our search produced 137 empirical articles that met the inclusion criteria. In the course of sorting studies by their primary focus, eight categories of empirical findings emerged: general distress and wellbeing (53 articles), COVID-19-specific stress (24 articles), beliefs in science, conspiracies, and misinformation (15 articles), COVID-19 public health behaviors (12 articles), perceived risk of COVID-19 (10 articles), perceived growth or positive changes taking place during the pandemic (nine articles), health behaviors (three articles), and consumer behavior (three articles). Findings indicated that religiousness was associated with both unique benefits and challenges and played a significant role in the pandemic. Religiousness was associated with a broad range of outcomes across geographical regions and populations during the first year of COVID-19. It was a commonly reported coping mechanism with varying levels of favorable associations with mental health and COVID-19-related behaviors.","David, Park, Awao, Vega, Zuckerman, White, Hanna","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cresp.2022.100075","20221130","Adjustment; COVID-19; Mental Health; Religion; Systematic Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41874,""

This study employed a cross-sectional analytical design, based on a self-administered online survey, conducted in 2021, among students aged 18-59 years. The sample size was 3985 students. Statistical analysis was done through frequency studies, hypothesis testing and a multivariate-penalized logistic regression model (<i>firthlogit</i>), based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). A total of 3573 students completed the survey, 61.5% were female, 55.3% were young (aged 18-26 years), and 44.6% were adults (aged 27-59 years). The prevalence of ENDS use during the pandemic was 7.3%. Age was negatively associated with ENDS use, as young people had a higher likelihood of using these devices. The likelihood of ENDS use was negative among females (OR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.2-0.5). In contrast, it was positive in students with a history of psychoactive substance abuse and/or dependence (OR=3.59; 95% CI: 1.0-12.0), students who had tried conventional cigarettes (OR=5.12; 95% CI: 3.0-8.5), participants who smoked tobacco during the pandemic (OR=3.15; 95% CI: 2.3-4.2), those who studied virtually (OR=1.52; 95% CI: 1.0-2.3), participants who lived with other ENDS users (OR=3.86; 95% CI: 2.8-5.2) and students with negative perception of impacts on their mental health (OR=1.48; 95% CI: 1.1-1.9). Being male, aged &lt;26 years, having a history of substance use, having tried conventional cigarettes, pandemic tobacco use, and having lived with other ENDS users, were the main factors associated with pandemic ENDS use. Studying the consumption habits of students in response to lifestyle changes, is fundamental for the formulation of strategies to reduce the development of addictive behaviors, especially in young students during the pandemic.","Maldonado Vias&#xfa;s, Perdomo, Garc&#xed;a Duran, Pulido, Hernandez, Borrero Roldan, Botero, Moreno","https://doi.org/10.18332/tid/154970","20221130","COVID-19; ENDS; college students; e-cigarettes; lifestyle","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41875,""
"Predictive model for long COVID in children 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test","To update and internally validate a model to predict children and young people (CYP) most likely to experience long COVID (i.e. at least one impairing symptom) 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and to determine whether the impact of predictors differed by SARS-CoV-2 status. Data from a nationally matched cohort of SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and test-negative CYP aged 11-17 years was used. The main outcome measure, long COVID, was defined as one or more impairing symptoms 3 months after PCR testing. Potential pre-specified predictors included SARS-CoV-2 status, sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation, quality of life/functioning (five EQ-5D-Y items), physical and mental health and loneliness (prior to testing) and number of symptoms at testing. The model was developed using logistic regression; performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination measures; internal validation was performed via bootstrapping and the final model was adjusted for overfitting. A total of 7139 (3246 test-positives, 3893 test-negatives) completing a questionnaire 3 months post-test were included. 25.2% (817/3246) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positives and 18.5% (719/3893) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negatives had one or more impairing symptoms 3 months post-test. The final model contained SARS-CoV-2 status, number of symptoms at testing, sex, age, ethnicity, physical and mental health, loneliness and four EQ-5D-Y items before testing. Internal validation showed minimal overfitting with excellent calibration and discrimination measures (optimism-adjusted calibration slope: 0.96575; C-statistic: 0.83130). We updated a risk prediction equation to identify those most at risk of long COVID 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test which could serve as a useful triage and management tool for CYP during the ongoing pandemic. External validation is required before large-scale implementation.","Nugawela, Stephenson, Shafran, De Stavola, Ladhani, Simmons, McOwat, Rojas, Dalrymple, Cheung, Ford, Heyman, Crawley, Pinto Pereira","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02664-y","20221129","COVID-19; Children and young people; Long COVID; Predictive model; Public health; Symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41876,""
"The impact of changing nonimmigrant visa policies on international students' psychological adjustment and well-being in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","Since the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the number of international students in the United States had been gradually increasing. However, the total numbers have begun to decrease since 2019-2020 school year due to the Trump administration's policy and COVID-19. Still, little is known about how international students' psychological adjustment and well-being have been affected by changing nonimmigrant visa policy and the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xa0; METHODS: We conducted a total of 34 online semi-structured in-depth interviews with international students from 18 countries of origin studying in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. More than 60% of the participants (21 out of 34) were aged 21 to 25. Among our 34 participants, gender and 18 were male and 16 were female, and 19 were undergraduate students and 15 were master's students. The majority of the participants were first-generation college students (22/34, 64.71%). Verbatim transcription was done for all interviews. NVivo was used for both deductive and inductive approaches to the qualitative analysis. Overall, the recent political climate negatively impacted participants' psychology of adjustment and well-being. July 6, 2020 Policy Directive for international students caused severe uncertainty about whether they can continue studying in the United States. There were many resources or services needed to overcome this period, such as extended mental and emotional support from the counseling services as well as financial and informational support from the international student office and university. Although international students had the benefit of the university's food assistance program, they were not eligible to receive any external support outside of the university and financial aid at the local and federal levels. Whether maintaining F-1 visa status was one of their major concerns. Due to COVID-19, job opportunities were limited, which made international students difficult to obtain Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and secure a job in the United States within the 90-day unemployment limit of Optical Practical Training (OPT). H-1B visa and permanent residency were other challenges to go through, but participants saw positive perspectives from the Biden administration. Uncertain policy changes due to COVID-19 and presidential transitions impacted international students' psychological well-being and adjustment. International students are important populations in the United States who have supported jobs that are high in demand and economically contributed to the United States. It is expected that future policies at various levels support international students' life and improve their health equity and mental health.","Park, Shimada","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14698-1","20221129","2020 presidential election; In-depth interview; International student; July 6,&#xa0;2020 Policy Directive; Mental health; Nonimmigrant visa; Permanent residency; Psychological well-being; Qualitative study; Social adjustment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41877,""
"Mental health outcomes following COVID-19 infection: impacts of post-COVID impairments and fatigue on depression, anxiety, and insomnia - a web survey in Sweden","The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health is now clearly established. However, information on the levels of mental ill health of people infected with COVID-19 and potential correlates of poor mental health is still limited. Therefore, the current study aimed to study indicative of potential mental health problems in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection/infections and address the impacts of post-COVID impairments and fatigue following COVID-19 infection/infections on depression, anxiety, and insomnia. A web-survey including demographics, questions related to COVID-19 status and post-COVID impairments, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue was completed by 507 individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection/infections. We found significant rates of significant depression, anxiety, and insomnia in our sample, with more than 70% experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs for at least one psychological health problems. Higher levels of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection in the acute phase, hospitalization because of COVID-19, and higher levels of post-COVID impairments and fatigue. Reduced motivation emerged as the strongest predictor for mental ill health. These findings highlight&#xa0;that individuals infected with COVID-19, especially those who still have experienced post-COVID impairments, are more likely to suffer from mental ill-health and may be more vulnerable for&#xa0;poor mental health outcomes. Therefore, more effective actions are&#xa0;needed&#xa0;to&#xa0;take in order to&#xa0;promote&#xa0;and protect&#xa0;mental health of individuals with a history of COVID-19 infection.","Badinlou, Lundgren, Jansson-Fr&#xf6;jmark","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04405-0","20221129","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fatigue; Insomnia; Mental health; Motivation; Post-COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41878,""
"Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on causes for the development of carbon monoxide intoxications","Several causes can lead to carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication. A first-line treatment option for such intoxications is hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO2) therapy. The COVID-19 pandemic has been changing everyday life in Germany since March 2020, mainly caused by statutory provisions. Our aim was to review whether these changes have an influence on the causes and frequency for the development of CO intoxication. We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who were treated for CO intoxication in our institution between April 2019 and March 2021. Besides demographic data, we compared the overall number and documented causes for each CO intoxication in the period of April 2020 to March 2021 with the period between April 2019 and March 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 139 patients were included. We found a significant decrease in the overall number of patients who needed treatment since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the share of CO intoxication caused by the indoor use of coal stoves, coal barbecue, or suicide attempts increased. In contrast, the share of cases caused by apartment or house fire, smoking waterpipe, or gas stoves decreased. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions lead to a significant reduction in the number of patients in need for HBO2 therapy due to CO-Intoxication. The causes leading to CO intoxication also changed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed a shift toward causes related to the indoor use of coal-fired stoves and barbecues as well as suicide attempts.","Prost, Eichhorn, Strelow, Schneppendahl, Windolf, Dreyer","https://www.google.com/search?q=Influence+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+causes+for+the+development+of+carbon+monoxide+intoxications.","20221129"," COVID-19 pandemic ;  carbon monoxide intoxication ;  hyperbaric oxygenation ;  suicide attempts ;  waterpipe ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41879,""
"Nurse-Led Virtual Delivery of PIECES in Canadian Long-Term Care Homes to Support the Care of Older Adults Experiencing Behavioral Expressions During COVID-19: A Qualitative Descriptive Study","Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound loss of life among older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes. As a pandemic response, LTC homes enforced infection control processes including isolating older adults in their rooms, cancelling therapeutic programs, and restricting family member visits. Social isolation negatively impacts older adults in LTC, which may result in increased rates of anxiety, depression, physical and cognitive decline, disorientation, fear, apathy, and premature death. Isolation of older adults can also cause an increase in responsive behaviours (e.g., yelling, hitting, calling out) to express frustration, fear, restricted movement and boredom. To respond to the challenges in LTC and support frontline staff, older adults and family members, a novel Registered Practical Nurse (RPN)-led delivery of the PIECESTM approach for addressing responsive behaviours among older adults with dementia using virtual training/mentoring was implemented in Canadian LTC homes. PIECESTM employs a person and family/care partner-centred, collaborative team-based approach to provide education and capacity building for nurses, engages families as active participants in care, and embeds evidence-informed practices to provide person- and family-centered care to older adults with complex needs including dementia. To describe experiences of LTC staff, family/care partners, and older adult research partners with implementing a novel RPN-led virtual adaptation of the PIECES care planning approach for responsive behaviors in two Canadian long-term care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a qualitative descriptive design, two focus groups were held with three to four staff members (e.g., RPNs, managers) per LTC home in Ontario. A third was held with three PIECES mentors. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with RPN champions, family/care partners, and older adult research partners. Research team meeting notes provided an additional source of data. Content analysis was conducted. A total of 22 participants took part in a focus group (n=11) or an in-depth individual interview (n=11). Participant experiences suggest that implementation of RPN-led virtual PIECES fostered individualized care, included family as partners in care, increased interdisciplinary collaboration and improved staff practices. However, virtual PIECES, as delivered, lacked opportunities for family member feedback on older adult outcomes. Implementation facilitators included the provision of mentorship and leadership at all levels of implementation, and suitable technological infrastructure. Barriers were related to availability and use of virtual communication technology (family members) and older adults became upset due to lack of comprehension during virtual care conferences. Findings give promising support to adopting virtual PIECES - a team approach to gather valuable family input and engagement to address residents' unmet needs and responsive behaviours in LTC. Future research should investigate a hybridized communication format to foster sustainable person and family-centered care planning practices to include active collaboration of families in individualized care plans.

"""If I get sick here, I will never see my children again"": The mental health&#xa0;of&#xa0;international migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the mental health of international migrants globally. Chile has managed its response to the pandemic in an ongoing context of social unrest and combined regional migratory and humanitarian crisis. The country's population presents a high prevalence of common mental disorders and a high suicide rate, with limited access to mental healthcare. International migrants in Chile represent 8% of the total population, and although a socioeconomically heterogenous group, they face social vulnerability, a range of mental health stressors and additional barriers to access mental healthcare. This study describes the mental health outcomes, stressors, response, and coping strategies perceived by international migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. A qualitative case study was carried out through individual online interviews to 30 international migrants living in Chile during the pandemic and 10 experts of the social and health care sectors. An inductive content analysis was carried out, a process during which the researchers sought to identify patterns and themes derived from the data. Participants experienced mainly negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety and depression symptomatology. Stressors included the virus itself, work, living and socioeconomic conditions, discrimination, fear for their family and distance caring. Institutional responses to address the mental health of international migrants during the pandemic in Chile were limited and participants relied mainly on individual coping strategies. The pandemic can represent an important opportunity to strengthen mental health systems for the general population as well as for population groups experiencing social vulnerability, if the issues identified and the lessons learned are translated into action at national, regional, and international level. Promoting the mental health of international migrants means recognising migration as a social determinant of mental health and adopting a cross-cultural as well as a Human Rights approach.","Blukacz, Cabieses, Obach, Madrid, Carre&#xf1;o, Pickett, Markkula","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277517","20221129","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41881,""
"Violence Against Physicians in the Workplace: Trends, Causes, Consequences, and Strategies for Intervention","Violence against healthcare professionals has become an emergency in many countries. Literature in this area has mainly focused on nurses while there are less studies on physicians, whose alterations in mental health and burnout have been linked to higher rates of medical errors and poorer quality of care. We summarized peer-reviewed literature and examined the epidemiology, main causes, consequences, and areas of intervention associated with workplace violence perpetrated against physicians. We performed a review utilizing several databases, by including the most relevant studies in full journal articles investigating the problem. Workplace violence against doctors is a widespread phenomenon, present all over the world and related to a number of variables, including individual, socio-cultural, and contextual variables. During the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence of violence has increased. Data also show the possible consequences in physicians' deterioration of quality of life, burnout, and traumatic stress which are linked to physical and mental health problems, which, in a domino effect, fall on patients' quality of care. Violence against doctors is an urgent global problem with consequences on an individual and societal level. This review highlights the need to undertake initiatives aimed at enhancing understanding, prevention, and management of workplace violence in healthcare settings.","Caruso, Toffanin, Folesani, Biancosino, Romagnolo, Riba, McFarland, Palagini, Belvederi Murri, Zerbinati, Grassi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01398-1","20221129","Burnout; Emergency departments; Physicians; Psychiatry; Violence; Workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41882,""

Method This study used an observational design and convenience sampling. NGN alumni (<i>n</i> = 192) from a pre-licensure nursing program were surveyed during the summer of 2021 regarding their experiences with resilience, anxiety, depression, and stress while transitioning to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Participants reported moderate to severe levels of stress (76%), anxiety (27.6%), and depression (31.2%) while transitioning to practice. Most (79%) described themselves as resilient. The highest mean scores for stress, anxiety, and depression occurred during the fourth to eighth month of practice. Conclusion Nursing professional development specialists, managers, and other stakeholders need effective strategies to monitor and promote NGNs' well-being and mental health to prevent burnout and turnover throughout the first year of practice. <b>[<i>J Contin Educ Nurs</i>. 2022;53(12):533-543.]</b>.","Urban, Rogers, Eades, Allard, Porter, Cipher","https://doi.org/10.3928/00220124-20221107-05","20221129","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41883,""
"Effects of telehealth on functional capacity, mental health and quality of life among older people with dementia: LAPESI telehealth protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Telehealth can be an alternative action at a distance that can help as a form of motor intervention, alleviating the deleterious effects arising from social distancing on functional capacity, mental health and quality of life among older people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to analyze the effects of a telehealth program on functional capacity, mental health and quality of life among older people with dementia and their caregivers. seventy-eight individuals with mild and moderate dementia and their caregivers will answer an anamnesis and be evaluated through Clinical Dementia Assessment Score. They will also be evaluated by blinded examiners in terms of functional capacity (Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0), mental health (Mini-Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency test and the Neuropsychiatric Inventor) and quality of life (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease scale). Afterward, the volunteers will be randomized into the telehealth training group and the control group. The TR will perform systematic physical and cognitive exercises in 50-min sessions three times a week with professional monitoring, while the CG will receive non-systematized guidance, both for 12&#xa0;weeks. Participants will be evaluated at baseline, immediately after the three-month interventions and with a 12-week follow- up. Technological approaches such as telehealth can be a viable alternative in home care service during times of pandemic. We expect that older people with dementia and their caregivers have high adherence to the telehealth program and improve their functional capacity, mental health and quality of life of older people with dementia. Telehealth is an alternative that can contribute to public policies and the development of effective intervention strategies that neutralize adverse outcomes. It can also be presented as an alternative to home care services, which could reduce demands for health resources.","Tsen, Andreatto, Aily, Pelicioni, Neto, Mattiello, Gomes, de Andrade","https://doi.org/10.1002/pri.1981","20221129","COVID-19; dementia; disability and health; international classification of functioning; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41884,""

CA provides a monthly allowance to children from birth to age 5. To date, existing studies on the effects of CA in Korea have focused mainly on household economic outcomes. The current study is the first to examine the effect of CA on maternal physical and mental health, measured by self-reported health status, depression, and life satisfaction. Methods We use nationally representative data from the Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) from 2017 to 2018. The analytic sample consists of 772 Korean mothers whose youngest child is between age 2 and age 7. Taking advantage of an exogenous policy change and the age eligibility of the policy, we employ a difference-in-regression-discontinuities (DRD) strategy to identify the effects of CA on self-reported health status, depression, and life satisfaction. Results Overall, we find suggestive evidence that the introduction of CA contributed to reducing depression while improving self-reported health and life satisfaction. In particular, the policy reform had a significant effect on life satisfaction, showing that CA improves life satisfaction by 0.497 points. Conclusions Results suggest that CA can improve both physical and mental health for eligible mothers. Such findings are indicative of a causal link between income and health. There has been a recent political movement to raise the age threshold of CA to up to age 18 to cover older children and increase benefit levels. Our findings provide important policy implications for the political discussion on CA expansion.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115117","20220801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41889,""

"Prediction of mental well-being from individual characteristics and circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic","The â€œMental Health Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on NIMH Patients and Volunteersâ€ study was a longitudinal study launched in spring 2020 by researchers at NIMH, to investigate the effect of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. For each participant, the study collected personal characteristics, such as demographics, psychological traits, and clinical history, together with personal circumstances at regular intervals during their enrollment in the study. In this paper, we examine the degree to which a variety of mental health outcomes over time for an individual can be predicted from personal characteristics and their changing circumstances, using regression models trained on other study participants. We find that it is possible to predict the variation of a participant's mental health outcomes from time point to time point, for most of the outcomes we consider. This capability is dominated by information about outcome at the point of enrollment in the study, but can be improved by considering personal characteristics and circumstances.","Carl Harris et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0200-800-3EB","20221129","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; prediction model; covid-19; mental health; regression model","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","",41892,""
"A qualitative forum analysis of fathersâ€™ stressors and support seeking behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic","Fathers experienced high rates of mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social support is crucial to mitigate these problems; however, access to and quality of support were impacted by public health guidelines to increase physical distancing. Online forums offer an avenue for peer connection and support. Yet, minimal research has examined forum use during COVID-19 to describe the experiences, perceived stressors, and resource need of fathers during the pandemic. This study qualitatively analyzed fathersâ€™ experiences through a Framework Analytic Approach of redditâ€™s sub-forum r/daddit. Posts (N=299) and comments (N=2597) between July and October 2020 were analyzed. Findings highlighted five main themes (with subthemes): forum use, family functioning, psychological and health factors, interpersonal functioning, and COVID-19. First and foremost, fathers used the online forum to provide support and advice to other fathers. Main themes are discussed in terms of informing the development of services to support father and family wellbeing.","Emily E.
