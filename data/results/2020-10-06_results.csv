METHODS: Ninety participants in an ongoing clinical trial of a risk reduction program for homeless, aged 18-25Â years, were administered items about COVID-19 between April 10 and July 9,Â 2020. RESULTS: Most participants reported engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors. Past week mental health symptoms were reported by 38%-48% of participants, depending on symptoms. Among those who used substances before the outbreak, 16%-28% reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. More than half of the participants reported increased difficulty meeting basic needs (e.g., food), and approximately 32%-44% reported more difficulty getting behavioral health services since the outbreak.

"Reopening K-12 Schools in the Era of Coronavirus Disease 2019: Review of State-Level Guidance Addressing Equity Concerns","OBJECTIVE: To determine how state guidance documents address equity concerns in K-12 schools during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Using online searches, we collected state-level documents from all 50 states and the District of Columbia discussing reopening plans for K-12 schools in the 2020-2021 academic year. We examined whether these documents explicitly mentioned equity as a concern, as well as if and how they addressed the following equity issues: food insecurity and child nutrition, homelessness or temporary housing, lack of access to Internet/technology, students with disabilities or special needs, English-language learners, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with the Department of Children and Family Services or an equivalent agency, mental health support, students/staff at greater risk of severe illness from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and students/staff living with someone at greater risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Forty-four of 51 states (86%) explicitly mentioned equity as a concern or guiding principle. At least 90% of states offered guidance for 7 equity issues. Fewer than 75% of states addressed homelessness or temporary housing, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with Department of Children and Family Services or an equivalent agency, and students/staff living with someone at greater risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Wide variability exists in state-level guidance to help K-12 schools develop reopening plans that protect those who are most vulnerable to learning loss or reduced access to basic needs. Interpretation and implementation by local educational agencies will need to be assessed.","Li, Alice; Harries, Michael; Ross, Lainie Friedman","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.08.069","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pediatr;2020 Aug 29.; Publication details: J Pediatr;2020 Aug 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5482,""
"Assessment and management of agitation, sleep, and mental illness in the surgical ICU","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increased focus on patient-centered outcomes, mental health, and delirium prevention makes this review timely and relevant for critical care. RECENT FINDINGS: This review focuses on patient-centered outcomes in the ICU, highlighting the latest research to promote brain health and psychological recovery during and after perioperative critical illness. Topics include sedation in the obese patient, delirium severity assessments, the role of the Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison in the ICU, Post-intensive care syndrome, and the importance of family engagement in the COVID era. SUMMARY: Highlighting new research, such as novel implementation strategies in addition to a lack of research in certain areas like sleep in the ICU may lead to innovation and establishment of evidence-based practices in critical care. Perioperative brain health is multifaceted, and an increase in multidisciplinary interventions may help improve outcomes and decrease morbidity in ICU survivors.","Ortiz, Damaris","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MCC.0000000000000762","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Opin Crit Care;2020 Sep 29.; Publication details: Curr Opin Crit Care;2020 Sep 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5483,""
"Shifts in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic: early indications from Australia","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption is currently unclear. This study aimed to provide early estimates of how stress and demographics will interact with shifts in harmful alcohol consumption from before the COVID-19 outbreak to two months into social distancing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional convenience sample. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 1684 Australians aged 18-65 who drink at least monthly. MEASUREMENTS: Items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). FINDINGS: Overall, harmful drinking decreased during social distancing measures in our sample (2019 score = 8.2 (7.9-8.4 95% confidence interval), during the pandemic = 7.3 (7.1-7.6)). Younger drinkers, particularly young women, decreased their consumption the most, but there was a small increase in consumption in middle-aged women. Drinkers experiencing high levels of stress also reported a relatively higher shift in harmful consumption compared with those with low levels of stress (ÃŸ=0.65, p=.003), despite reporting a small decrease overall. CONCLUSIONS: The closure of licensed premises and social distancing measures in Australia in response to the COVID-19 outbreak appear to have reduced harmful alcohol consumption in younger drinkers, particularly young women.","Callinan, Sarah; Smit, Koen; Mojica-Perez, Yvette; D'Aquino, Simon; Moore, David; Kuntsche, Emmanuel","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/add.15275","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Addiction;2020 Oct 02.; Publication details: Addiction;2020 Oct 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5484,""
"The 'new normal' in mental healthcare: will the COVID-19 pandemic be the catalyst for online mental healthcare?","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated an immediate and largescale uptake of online treatment in mental healthcare, and we are still unsure about the new normal in mental healthcare in post COVID-19 times. A relevant question we can begin to ask is to what extent the experiences gained during the pandemic will influence a sustainable adoption and implementation of online treatment in mental healthcare in the future. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online treatment in mental healthcare after COVID-19. METHODS: In an interview study 11 mental healthcare professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited in a mental healthcare organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between 7 April and 30 April 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using a thematic coding method. RESULTS: From the interviews we learn that the new normal in mental healthcare will most likely consist of more blended treatments. Due to skill enhancement and (unexpected) positive experiences with the possibilities of online treatment, an increase in adoption is likely to take place. However, not all experiences promise a successful and sustainable upscaling of online treatment in the future. Mental healthcare professionals are learning that not all clients are able to benefit from the possibilities it offers. CONCLUSIONS: Sustainable upscaling of online mental healthcare requires customized solutions, investments in technology, and flexibility by mental healthcare providers. Online treatment could work for those open to it, but many factors influence whether it will work in specific situations. There is work to be done yet before online treatment is inherently part of the new normal in mental healthcare.","Bierbooms, Joyce J P A; van Haaren, Monique; IJsselsteijn, Wijnand A; de Kort, Yvonne A W; Feijt, Milou; Bongers, Inge M B","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21344","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2020 Sep 05.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2020 Sep 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5485,""
"COVID-19-lockdown impact and vulnerability factors on cognitive functioning and mental health","The COVID-19 outbreak and its associated restrictive measures, such as lockdown, exposed most individuals to an unprecedented stressful situation, increasing worldwide the prevalence of mental health disorders. Here, we aimed at exploring for the first time the effect of COVID-19-lockdown on subjective cognitive functioning as well as mental health, in terms of its prevalence and clinical severity. In addition, potential risk factors characterizing more vulnerable groups were investigated. A nationwide cross-sectional online-survey was conducted during the final phase of lockdown in Italy (after 7-10 weeks of home confinement), leading to a sample of 1215 participants. We found lockdown can have a severe impact on subjective cognitive functioning, along with mental health disorders. Namely, under restrictions, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in everyday tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions; while no changes in language abilities were reported. Conversely, a paradoxical effect was observed in memory domain, with people experiencing a reduction of memory failures compared to pre-lockdown times. Further, higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders and of other psychological issues (involving sleep, appetite, libido and hypochondria) were observed - with a prevalence of mild-to-severe depression and anxiety rising up to 32.30% and 35.72% respectively, under restrictions. Being female, young (<45 years), repeatedly exposed to COVID-19-media, working from home or being unemployed were identified as relevant risk factors for experiencing cognitive worsening and mental health disorders, related to the COVID-19 lockdown. Being resident in high infection-prevalence areas was related to higher level of depression and health anxiety. As lockdown and quarantine measures could be reimposed, health officials have to carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decision-making process, to develop an effective global and long-term response to the mental health challenges of this pandemic as well as to implement psychological interventions and specific guidelines, particularly about COVID-19-media exposure.","Eleonora Fiorenzato; Silvia Zabberoni; Alberto Costa; Giorgia Cona","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.02.20205237","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5486,""
"Response to the Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) Pandemic Across Africa: Successes, Challenges, and Implications for the Future","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed considerable lives  There are major concerns in Africa due to existing high prevalence rates for both infectious and non-infectious diseases and limited resources in terms of personnel, beds and equipment  Alongside this, concerns that lockdown and other measures will have on prevention and management of other infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  NCDs are an increasing issue with rising morbidity and mortality rates  The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that a lack of nets and treatment could result in up to 18 million additional cases of malaria and up to 30,000 additional deaths in sub-Saharan Africa  Objective: Document current prevalence and mortality rates from COVID-19 alongside economic and other measures to reduce its spread and impact across Africa  In addition, suggested ways forward among all key stakeholder groups  Our Approach: Contextualise the findings from a wide range of publications including internet-based publications coupled with input from senior-level personnel  Ongoing Activities: Prevalence and mortality rates are currently lower in Africa than among several Western countries and the USA  This could be due to a number of factors including early instigation of lockdown and border closures, the younger age of the population, lack of robust reporting systems and as yet unidentified genetic and other factors  Innovation is accelerating to address concerns with available equipment  There are ongoing steps to address the level of misinformation and its consequences including fines  There are also ongoing initiatives across Africa to start addressing the unintended consequences of COVID-19 activities including lockdown measures and their impact on NCDs including the likely rise in mental health disorders, exacerbated by increasing stigma associated with COVID-19  Strategies include extending prescription lengths, telemedicine and encouraging vaccination  However, these need to be accelerated to prevent increased morbidity and mortality  Conclusion: There are multiple activities across Africa to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and address misinformation, which can have catastrophic consequences, assisted by the WHO and others, which appear to be working in a number of countries  Research is ongoing to clarify the unintended consequences given ongoing concerns to guide future activities  Countries are learning from each other","Ogunleye, O.

"Harm reduction via online platforms for people who use drugs in Russia: A qualitative analysis of web outreach work","Background Harm reduction services to people who use drugs (PWUD) in Russia are insufficient in terms of quantity, government endorsement, and accessibility  The situation has recently deteriorated even further because of social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic  Recently several harm reduction organizations have started to provide some harm reduction services via online platforms by web outreach  However, little is known on how online outreach services are organized and implemented  Drawing on the example of St  Petersburg-based NGO ""Humanitarian Action"" we explored web outreach work in Telegram instant messenger  Methods 4 semi-structured interviews with the NGO staff and 301 cases of web outreach work with PWUD comprised the dataset  The process of web outreach, service provision to PWUD, and PWUD's needs were thematically analyzed  Results Three stages of the process of web outreach work were determined: clients initiating communication, NGO workers addressing clients' needs, and NGO workers receiving clients' feedback  Communication proceeded either in group chat or in direct messages  Challenges in addressing clients' needs happened when clients turned for help in nighttime, sent recorded voice messages, sent unclear messages, and/or were unwilling to transition to telephone communication  All web outreach workers reported receiving only positive feedback on their work  PWUD's needs were categorized into two major themes, depending on whether they can be addressed fully or partially online  In cases of online only provision of services, web outreach workers helped PWUD treat minor injection drug use complications, obtain verified harm reduction information and receive general psychological support  In instances of partial online services provision, PWUD were assisted in getting treatment of severe injection drug use complications, overdoses, and in accessing offline medical, psychological, social, legal and harm reduction services  Conclusions Our research demonstrated that web outreach work is a convenient tool for delivering some harm reduction services to PWUD either partially or completely online and recruiting new clients (including hard-to-reach PWUD that avoid attending brick-and-mortar facilities)  It indicates that harm reduction organizations should consider incorporating online harm reduction services into their activities  However, more research is needed to explore relative advantages and disadvantages of online harm reduction services delivery","Davitadze, A.; Meylakhs, P.; Lakhov, A.; King, E.

"Evaluating perspectives of relatives of nursing home residents on the nursing home visiting restrictions during the COVID-19 crisis: a Dutch cross-sectional survey study","Objectives COVID-19 has caused many nursing homes to prohibit resident visits to prevent viral spread  Although visiting restrictions are instituted to prolong the life of nursing home residents, they may detrimentally affect their quality of life  The aim of this study is to capture perspectives from the relatives of nursing home residents on nursing home visiting restrictions  Design A cross-sectional online survey was conducted  Setting and participants: A convenience sample of Dutch relatives of nursing home residents (n = 1997) filled in an online survey on their perspectives regarding nursing home visiting restrictions  Methods The survey included Likert-item, multi-select, and open answer questions targeting four key areas: (1) communication access to residents, (2) adverse effects of visiting restrictions on residents and relatives, (3) potential protective effect of visiting restrictions, (4) important aspects for relatives during and after visiting restrictions  Results Satisfaction of communication access to nursing home residents was highest when respondents had the possibility to communicate with nursing home residents by nurses informing them via telephone, contact behind glass, and contact outside maintaining physical distance  Satisfaction rates increased when respondents had multiple opportunities to stay in contact with residents  Respondents were concerned that residents had increased loneliness (76%), sadness (66%), and decreased quality of life (62%) while study respondents reported personal sadness (73%) and fear (26%)  There was no consensus amongst respondents if adverse effects of the visiting restrictions outweighed the protective effect for nursing home residents  Respondents expressed the need for increased information, communication options, and better safety protocols  Conclusion and Implications Providing multiple opportunities to stay in touch with nursing home residents can increase satisfaction of communication between residents and relatives  Increased context specific information, communication options and safety protocols should be addressed in national health policy","Wammes, Joost D.; Kolk, Daisy; van den Besselaar, Judith H.; MacNeil- Vroomen, Janet L.; Buurman- van Es, Bianca M.; van Rijn, Marjon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.031","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association;2020.; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5495,""

"""Hey, we also have something to say"": A qualitative study of Portuguese adolescents' and young people's experiences under COVID-19","OBJECTIVE: (1) To give adolescents and youth a voice and listen to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in their lives; (2) to identify their coping strategies; (3) present lessons learned to be better prepared for future pandemics. METHODS: Six hundred and seventeen participants from 16 to 24 years old (M = 19.2 years; F = 19.1 years) answered the online questionnaire during the pandemic lockdown. Sociodemographic data were analyzed with SPSS version 26 and qualitative data with MAXQDA 2020. Engel's Biopsychosocial model supported the analysis and data presentation. RESULTS: in terms of impacts, stands out: biological-headaches and muscle pain; psychological-more time to perform pleasant and personal development activities, but more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, longer screen time, and more substance use; social-increase of family conflicts and disagreements, loss of important life moments, contacts, and social skills, but it allows a greater selection of friendships. Regarding coping strategies, the importance of facing these times with a positive perspective, carrying out pleasurable activities, keeping in touch with family and friends, and establishing routines are emphasized. As lessons for future pandemics, the importance of respecting the norms of the Directorate-General for Health, the need for the National Health System to be prepared, as well as teachers and students for online learning, and studying the possibility of establishing routines with the support of television. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates adolescents and young people's perception of the impacts of the pandemic upon them, as well as their competence to participate in the issues that directly affect them. Priorities to mitigate the impact of future pandemics are presented.","Branquinho, CÃ¡tia; Kelly, Colette; Arevalo, Lourdes C; Santos, Anabela; Gaspar de Matos, Margarida","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22453","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Community Psychol;2020 Oct 01.; Publication details: J Community Psychol;2020 Oct 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5503,""

Methods: Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 members, mean age 84 years (SD=0.3), responded to an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n=190). We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes. Results: Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity. In multivariable regression models, adherence to guidance by leaving the house less often associated with less professional occupational class (OR=0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.98) and poorer self-rated general health (OR=0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92). Increased internet use associated with female sex (OR=2.32, 95%CI 1.12-4.86) and higher general cognitive ability (OR=1.53, 95%CI 1.03-2.33). Loneliness associated with living alone (OR=0.15, 95%CI 0.07-0.31) and greater anxiety symptoms (OR=1.76, 95%CI 0.45-1.24).

"COVID-19 Pandemic in University Hospital: Is There an Effect on The Medical Interns?","Introduction Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the current healthcare system and carries a major impact to the healthcare workers (HCW). University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) has been selected as one of the centres in managing COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. Many HCW including the medical interns, are directly or indirectly involved in the management. Methods This is a cross-sectional, pilot study to determine the impact of the pandemic on UMMC medical interns. A survey which comprises 37-items was used. Data are analysed by Ordinal Logistic Regression Analysis. Results Our study shows that medical interns are tired (p = 0.014), starving (p = 0.004), have inadequate exercises (p = 0.004) and burdened with heavy workload (p=0.023) during pandemic period. Many are depressed (p = 0.043), scared to work (p = 0.03), and worried of getting infected (p < 0.05). Some quarrel with their colleagues (p < 0.05), losing contact with friends (p = 0.022) and feel that it will be beneficial to have a peer support group (p = 0.027). Conclusion In summary, the impact of COVID-19 amongst medical interns is significant and their overall well-being should be protected without jeopardising their training.","WeiHonn Lim; Li Ying Teoh; Kanesh Kumaran Seevalingam; Shanggar Kuppusamy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205112","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5506,""
"Risk perception, knowledge, information sources and emotional states among COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China","BACKGROUND: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis. Several factors influencing risk perception have been identified, including knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states. Prior studies on COVID-19-related risk perception primarily focused on the general public, with little data available on COVID-19 patients. PURPOSE: To investigate COVID-19 patients' risk perception, knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states in the epicenter, Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Data were collected online using self-administered electronic questionnaire developed with reference to previous relevant studies and publications by the World Health Organization. FINDINGS: A higher level of perceived risk was found in relation to COVID-19 as compared to other potential health threats. Knowledge gaps existed regarding transmission and prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, risk perception was negatively related to knowledge and positively related to depressive states. Moreover, social media was a primary source for COVID-19 information, whereas the most trusted sources were health professionals. DISCUSSION: Realistic perception of risk should be encouraged considering both physical and mental health while developing relevant strategies. Furthermore, risk communication needs to be specifically tailored for various target groups, such as the elderly and mentally vulnerable individuals, with the adoption of popular media platforms.","Zhong, Yaping; Liu, Weihua; Lee, Tsorng-Yeh; Zhao, Huan; Ji, Ji","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2020.08.005","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Nurs Outlook;2020 Aug 22.; Publication details: Nurs Outlook;2020 Aug 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5507,""
"Finding the Right Balance: An Evidence-Informed Guidance Document to Support the Re-Opening of Canadian Nursing Homes to Family Caregivers and Visitors during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","During the first few months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Canadian nursing homes implemented strict no-visitor policies to reduce the risk of introducing COVID-19 in these settings. There are now growing concerns that the risks associated with restricted access to family caregivers and visitors have started to outweigh the potential benefits associated with preventing COVID-19 infections. Many residents have sustained severe and potentially irreversible physical, functional, cognitive, and mental health declines. As Canada emerges from its first wave of the pandemic, nursing homes across the country have cautiously started to reopen these settings, yet there is broad criticism that emerging visitor policies are overly restrictive, inequitable, and potentially harmful. We reviewed the nursing home visitor policies for Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories as well as international policies and reports on the topic to develop 10 provi-informed, data-driven, and expert-reviewed guidance for the re-opening of Canadian nursing homes to family caregivers and visitors.","Stall, Nathan M; Johnstone, Jennie; McGeer, Allison J; Dhuper, Misha; Dunning, Julie; Sinha, Samir K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.07.038","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Med Dir Assoc;21(10): 1365-1370.e7, 2020 10.; Publication details: J Am Med Dir Assoc;21(10): 1365-1370.e7, 2020 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5508,""

"Ethnic Identity and Coping Strategies as Moderators of COVID-19 Racial Discrimination Experiences Among Chinese Americans","A moderated mediation path analysis indicated COVID-19 racial discrimination was negatively associated with life satisfaction and positively related to depression in Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans (CCA; N = 187). Strong ethnic identity moderated the relationship between COVID-19 discrimination and depression. Higher levels of coping moderated the relationship between depression and life satisfaction. Professional counselors are thus called to help CCA clients expand their coping skills to mitigate the effects of pandemic-related discrimination. Counselors can also help Chinese clients raise their critical consciousness and understand how oppressive systems and experiences of discrimination are linked to overall mental health and wellbeing.","Litam, Stacey Diane AraÃ±ez; Oh, Seungbin","https://doi.org/10.1080/21501378.2020.1814138","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Couns.

"Anxiety, Depression and Behavioural Changes in Junior Doctors and Medical Students Associated with the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey","Introduction: Medical students are known to have high levels of depression, anxiety and stress from the high-pressure environments that they study and train in. The coronavirus pandemic presents source of stress and anxiety to large populations in general, and to healthcare professionals in particular. This study was undertaken to assess the psychological effects of this pandemic on the mental health of medical students and trainees. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire was designed to capture information on the participant's anxieties related to the pandemic and included a validated tool for the assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms (GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively). The questionnaire was prepared on Google Forms, and the link to the questionnaire was disseminated to 113 medical students and junior doctors on 19 April 2020, and the survey closed on 22 April 2020 midnight. Results: The survey was sent to 113 students, and 83 students participated. Of the participants, 47 (56.6%) were female and 36 (43.4%) were male, and 80 (96.4%) were aged less than 30Â years old. Formal anxiety and depression scores using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 tools indicated 15/82 (18.3%) had anxiety scores of 0 (lowest possible) and 21/82 (25.6%) had the lowest possible depression score of 0. However, 6/82 (7.3%) had scores that were classified as severe depression. Females had significantly higher median anxiety (5 v 2, p < 0.002) and depression scores (5 v 3, p = 0.025) than male participants. Direct patient care and care of patients with Covid-19 did not result in significant deterioration in anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Female students/junior doctors showed higher anxiety and depression scores than males. Direct patient care and care of patients with Covid-19 did not result in a measurable deterioration in anxiety and depression in this study. In this stressful pandemic situation, it is imperative to look after the mental health of healthcare workers as well as patients.","Pandey, Uma; Corbett, Gillian; Mohan, Suruchi; Reagu, Shuja; Kumar, Shubham; Farrell, Thomas; Lindow, Stephen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13224-020-01366-w","","Country: IN; ÃNDIA; INDIA; INDIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Obstet Gynaecol India;: 1-5, 2020 Sep 24.; Publication details: J Obstet Gynaecol India;: 1-5, 2020 Sep 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5511,""

Design: Narrative review. Setting: Non-institutionalized community-living people. Participants: 20.069 individuals from ten descriptive cross-sectional papers. Measurements: Articles since 2019 to 2020 published on Pubmed, Scielo and Google Scholar databases with the following MeSh terms (â€˜COVID-19â€™, â€˜coronavirusâ€™, â€˜agingâ€™, â€˜older peopleâ€™, â€˜elderlyâ€™, â€˜social isolationâ€™ and â€˜quarantineâ€™) in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. The studies not including people over 60 were excluded. Guidelines, recommendations, and update documents from different international organizations related to mental and physical activity were also analysed. Results: 41 documents have been included in this narrative review, involving a total of 20.069 individuals (58% women), from Asia, Europe and America. 31 articles included recommendations and 10 addressed the impact of social distancing on mental or physical health. The main outcomes reported were anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and physical inactivity during the isolation period. Cognitive strategies and increasing physical activity levels using apps, online videos, telehealth, are the main international recommendations. Conclusion: Mental and physical health in older people are negatively affected during the social distancing for COVID-19. Therefore, a multi component program with exercise and psychological strategies are highly recommended for this population during the confinement.

"Can neighborhoods protect residents from mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic? Evidence from Wuhan","Neighborhoods have begun to play an increasingly prominent role in shaping mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because residents are spending more time at home and in their immediate neighborhoods. Using data collected from 3,031 urban residents during the COVID-19 lockdown of Wuhan, Chinaâ€™s earliest epicenter, this study investigates the relationship between neighborhoodsâ€™ social infrastructure and residentsâ€™ mental distress. Results of structural equation modeling estimation reveal that services provided by urban residentsâ€™ committees (cheng shi ju wei hui) and volunteer groups significantly decrease the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on residentsâ€™ mental health in a Chinese context, and social cohesion is one of the mechanisms underpinning this influence. Residentsâ€™ committees and volunteer groups are found to increase their support when neighborhoods are facing an escalated level of COVID-19 risk. The residents who receive more support from their neighborhood organizations perceive a higher level of social cohesion and experience less mental distress. The findings suggest that mobilizing neighborhoodsâ€™ organizational resources and fostering social cohesion are crucial strategies to minimizing residentsâ€™ mental distress during COVID-19 pandemic.","Miao, Jia; Zeng, Donglin; Shi, Zhilei","https://doi.org/10.1080/21620555.2020.1820860","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Chin.

"Forced adaptations of sporting behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic and their effects on subjective well-being","Few studies have shown that exercise withdrawal and forced inactivity lead to negative mood states and increased symptoms of depression. Involuntary inactivity has become reality for millions during the Covid-19 pandemic, as mitigation and containment policies included the closings of sports facilities and leisure infrastructures. Based on representative survey data from Germany (=14 years, N = 1001), the paper addresses the changes in sport and exercise activities in the pandemic situation and their association with emotional well-being. Findings show a reduced level of emotional well-being in the German population during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, those individuals who stopped or considerably reduced their sport and exercise activities during the pandemic report a significant decline of well-being compared to the time before the pandemic. Individuals, who reduced sport and exercise due to external constraints, reported the largest decline in well-being. In contrast, the small group of individuals who intensified their sporting activities during the pandemic stands out with the most positive well-being levels. Irrespective of sport and exercise adaptations, findings additionally show that females report a steeper decline in well-being during the crisis compared to men.","Mutz, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1080/14616696.2020.1821077","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Eur.

"Successful Orthotopic Liver Transplantation in a Patient with a Positive SARS-CoV2 Test and Acute Liver Failure Secondary to Acetaminophen Overdose","SARS-CoV2, first described in December 2019, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various surgical and medical societies promptly published guidelines, based on expert opinion, on managing patients with COVID-19, with a consensus to postpone elective surgeries and procedures. We describe the case of an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in a young female who presented with acute liver failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity to manage abdominal pain and in the setting of a positive SARS-CoV2 test. Despite a positive test, she had no respiratory symptoms at time of presentation. The positive test was thought to be residual viral load. The patient had a very favorable outcome, likely related to multiple factors including her young age, lack of respiratory COVID-19 manifestations and plasma exchange peri-operatively. We recommend a full work-up for OLT in COVID-19 patients with uncomplicated disease according to standard of care, with careful interpretation of COVID-19 testing in patients presenting with conditions requiring urgent or emergent surgery as well as repeat testing even a few days after initial testing, as this could alter management.","Rouphael, D'Amico, Ricci, Cywinski, Miranda, Koval, Duggal, Quintini, Menon, Miller, Modaresi Esfeh","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16330","20201005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5515,""
"Suicidal behaviors and ideation during emerging viral disease outbreaks before the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic rapid review","The current COVID-19 pandemic is the most severe pandemic of the 21st century, on track to having a rising death toll. Beyond causing respiratory distress, COVID-19 may also cause mortality by way of suicide. The pathways by which emerging viral disease outbreaks (EVDOs) and suicide are related are complex and not entirely understood. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association between EVDOs and suicidal behaviors and/or ideation. An electronic search was conducted using five databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus in April 2020. A rapid systematic review was carried out, which involved separately and independently extracting quantitative data of selected articles. The electronic search yielded 2480 articles, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the data were collected in Hong Kong (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3) and the USA (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3). Four studies reported a slight but significant increase in deaths by suicide during EVDOs. The increase in deaths by suicide was mainly reported during the peak epidemic and in older adults. Psychosocial factors such as the fear of being infected by the virus or social isolation related to quarantine measures were the most prominent factors associated with deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Overall, we found scarce and weak evidence for an increased risk of deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Our results inform the need to orient public health policies toward suicide prevention strategies targeting the psychosocial effects of EVDOs. High-quality research on suicide risk and prevention are warranted during the current pandemic.","Leaune, Samuel, Oh, Poulet, Brunelin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106264","20201005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5516,""

"Existential positive psychology and integrative meaning therapy","The unprecedented changes in our society because of COVID-19 and the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) shows that our healthcare system and the medical approach to psychotherapy can no longer meet the mental health needs of society. This paper first described the negative impact of COVID-19 and 4IR on our mental health. Then, following a brief critique of the medical model, this paper proposes that the future of psychotherapy needs to be based on the more inclusive and integrative framework of existential positive psychology (PP 2.0), which emphasizes flourishing through suffering. Finally, the paper emphasizes Viktor Frankl's cure and Wong's integrative meaning therapy. It concludes that integrative meaning therapy represents the future of psychotherapy, because it is situated in the area of interactions of at least three traditions: Clinical psychology, existential psychology, and positive psychology. This integrative model is holistic, recognising humans as bio-psycho-social-spiritual beings and considers several theoretical perspectives in both diagnosis and treatment.","Wong","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2020.1814703","20201005","Existential positive psychology (PP2.0); Viktor Frankl; existential psychology; logotherapy; meaning therapy; positive psychology; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5519,""

The overall rate of consultations (face-to-face and telehealth) increased during March and April 2020, compared to the monthly face-to-face consultation average, excepting Tasmania. Compared to an annual monthly average of in-person consultations for July 2018-June 2019, total telepsychiatry consultations were higher for April than May. For total video and telephone telehealth consultations combined, video consultations were lower in April and higher in May. As a percentage of combined telehealth and in-person consultations, telehealth was greater for April and lower for May compared to the monthly face-to-face consultation average. In the smaller states/territories, the private practice workforce rapidly adopted COVID-19 MBS telehealth items, with the majority of psychiatric consultation shifting to telehealth initially, and then returning to face-to-face. With a second wave of COVID-19 in Australia, telehealth is likely to remain a vital part of the national mental health strategy.","Looi, Allison, Bastiampillai, Pring","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220960381","20201005","COVID-19; private practice; psychiatrist; telehealth; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5521,""
"Different Trajectories of Panic and the Associated Factors among Unmarried Chinese during the COVID-19 Pandemic","A large number of the population experienced panic during the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. The current study explored the trajectory of panic and its associated factors to develop promising strategies for controlling the global spread of COVID-19 and improving the mental health emergency management. A total of 812 unmarried adults (aged from 18 to 42Ã‚Â years, MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23.3, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.45) from all over China participated online in our investigation. A Growth Mixture Model (GMM) was developed and analysed. Three classes of trajectories for panic were identified: the &quot;continuous decline group (CDG)&quot;, the &quot;continuous low group (CLG),&quot; and the &quot;continuous high group (CHG)&quot;. With reference to the CDG, people in the CHG were more sensitive to social factors. With reference to the CDG, people in the CLG were more likely to possess some of the following traits: being men, in Hubei Province (center of the pandemic), with a lower income, and less sensitive towards social factors and individual factors. With reference to the CLG, people in the CHG were more likely to be women, located outside of Hubei Province, and more sensitive to social factors, family factors, and individual factors. Social factors, family factors, and individual factors predicted the different trajectories of panic.","Tan, Lin, Wu, Chen, Jiang, He, Yin, Tang","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12238","20201005","COVID-19; family factors; individual factors; panic; social factors; trajectory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5522,""
"Mental Health Conditions of Italian Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Disease Outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic in Italy represents a unique threat in terms of psychological distress. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the psychological health of Italian healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak. We assessed participants' current psychological distress and coping strategies in the midst of the COVID outbreak (March-April 2020), and also asked them to retrospectively report how they remember feeling before the COVID-19 outbreak (December 2019). We examined associations between psychological distress and coping strategies with mental health and infection perceptions. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed online to healthcare professionals (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 580) residing in different Italian regions from 26 March to 9 April 2020. The questionnaire measured changes in psychological states, coping strategies, and demographic variables testing variations in mental health and infection risk perception among Italian healthcare workers. Overall, approximately 33.5 per cent of healthcare professionals in our sample meet the threshold for psychiatric morbidity. Participants perceive their current psychological health to be worse during the COVID-19 emergency outbreak as compared to before the outbreak, and this was especially true among women. Both immediate and long-term monitoring psychological assistance services for healthcare workers should be implemented by national institutions to re-establish the psychological well-being and enhance the self-confidence and resilience of hospital personnel.","Bettinsoli, Di Riso, Napier, Moretti, Bettinsoli, Delmedico, Piazzolla, Moretti","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12239","20201005","COVID-19; Italy; healthcare workers; mental health; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5523,""
"Coping styles and mental health in response to societal changes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychosocial responses to infectious disease outbreaks have the potential to inflict acute and longstanding mental health consequences. Early research across the globe has found wide ranging psychological responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how different coping styles can be effective in mitigating mental ill health would enable better tailored psychological support. The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of psychosocial responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including depression, anxiety and distress, as well as effective coping styles in an Australian sample. A sample of 1,495 adults, residing in Australia between April 3rd and May 3rd 2020, completed an online survey which measured psychological distress (Impact of Events Scale-Revised), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS-21), as well as coping strategies (Brief COPE). 47% of the respondents were experiencing some degree of psychological distress. Females experienced higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than males. Coping strategies associated with better mental health were positive reframing, acceptance and humour. Conversely, self-blame, venting, behavioural disengagement and self-distraction were associated with poorer mental health. Rates of psychological symptoms amongst the Australian population are similar to those reported in other countries. Findings add to the growing literature demonstrating a gender disparity in the mental health impacts of COVID-19. Positive emotion focused coping strategies may be effective for reducing psychological symptoms. Understanding psychosocial responses including beneficial coping strategies are crucial to manage the current COVID-19 situation optimally, as well as to develop mental health response plans for future pandemics.","Gurvich, Thomas, Thomas, Hudaib, Sood, Fabiatos, Sutton, Isaacs, Arunogiri, Sharp, Kulkarni","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020961790","20201005","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5524,""
"Psychological states of Bangladeshi people four months after the COVID-19 pandemic: An online survey","The COVID-19 pandemic essentially imposes psychological effects on people. As the pandemic progresses, people experience psychological trauma gradually, which can change over time. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among Bangladeshi people four months after the COVID-19 outbreak. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Bangladeshi citizens aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years from June 1 to June 10, 2020. The participants completed an online questionnaire examining socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 related factors, along with the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21. A total of 1146 respondents have been included in the study. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, IBM Statistics version 22.0. The prevalence of moderate to the extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress was 47.2%, 46.0%, and 32.5%, respectively, with no significant gender differences. The prevalence of anxiety and stress was significantly higher in participants aged &gt;30 than in participants aged 18-30 years. Daily follow up COVID-19 related news, having COVID-19 symptoms so far, having contact (direct or indirect) with COVID-19 infected person, and fear of infection were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Sizable proportions of participants had depression, anxiety and stress four months after the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. The findings of this study underscores the need for strategies aimed at reducing these psychological sufferings in Bangladeshi people in the context of COVID-19.","Zubayer, Rahman, Islam, Babu, Rahman, Bhuiyan, Khan, Chowdhury, Hossain, Habib","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05057","20201005","Anxiety; Bangladeshi people; COVID-19; Depression; Psychological states; Psychology; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5525,""
"COVID-19 Devastation of African American Families: Impact on Mental Health and the Consequence of Systemic Racism","African Americans are bearing a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, no previous study has delineated inequities potentially incentivized by systemic racism, and whether synergistic effects impose an abnormally high burden of social determinants of mental health on African American families in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. We applied the social ecological model (SEM) to portray inequities induced by systemic racism that impact the mental health of African American families. In our model, we identified systemic racism to be the primary operator of mental health disparity, which disproportionately affects African American families at all levels of the SEM. Programs tailored towards reducing the disproportionate detrimental effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of African Americans need to be culturally appropriate and consider the nuances of systemic racism, discrimination, and other institutionalized biases.","Ibrahimi, Yusuf, Dongarwar, Maiyegun, Ikedionwu, Salihu","https://doi.org/10.21106/ijma.408","20201005","African American; COVID-19; Mental health; Social determinants of mental health; Systemic racism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5526,""
"Covid-19 and Neuro-Behavioral Economics: A Conceptual Framework to Improve Physical and Mental Health among Remote Workers","Long-term home confinement during the ongoing COVID-19 can have negative mental and physical health consequences, which in turn can reduce productivity among those working remotely. We sought to delineate factors related to neuro-behavioral economics that employers should consider for their employees who are teleworking during the current Covid-19 pandemic. Physical and mental well-being are intertwined and are strongly correlated to high productivity at workplace. By integrating the factors of neuro-behavioral economics into the work culture, companies will alleviate work-related stress leading to improved mental and physical functioning; thus leading to increased productivity.","Dongarwar, Yusuf, Maiyegun, Ibrahimi, Ikedionwu, Salihu","https://doi.org/10.21106/ijma.399","20201005","COVID-19; Mental health; Neuro-behavioral economics; Teleworking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5527,""
"Individual Differences, Economic Stability, and Fear of Contagion as Risk Factors for PTSD Symptoms in the COVID-19 Emergency","On January 30th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Italy has been one of the most affected countries in the world. To contain further spread of the virus, the Italian government has imposed an unprecedented long-period lockdown for the entire country. This dramatic scenario may have caused a strong psychological distress, with potential negative long-term mental health consequences. The aim of the present study is to report the prevalence of high psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the general population, especially considering that this aspect is consistently associated with PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, the present study aims to identify the risk factors for high PTSD symptoms, including individual differences and subjective perception of both economic and psychological aspects. We administered an online survey to 1253 participants during the peak period of the contagion in Italy. A logistic regression on the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) scores was used to test the risk factors that predict the possibility to develop PTSD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gender (female), lower perceived economic stability, higher neuroticism, and fear and consequences of contagion were predictors of high PTSD symptomatology. The results, highlighted in the present study, extend our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the population's mental health, by identifying individuals at high-risk of developing PTSD. This may help with the implementation of specific protocols to prevent the possibility of developing symptoms of PTSD in target populations.","Di Crosta, Palumbo, Marchetti, Ceccato, La Malva, Maiella, Cipi, Roma, Mammarella, Verrocchio, Di Domenico","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567367","20201005","COVID-19; IES-R; PTSD; distress; economic stability; neuroticism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5528,""
"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Guangdong College Students: The Difference Between Seeking and Not Seeking Psychological Help","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has considerably psychologically impacted Chinese college students. Several types of online mental health services were widely implemented for college students during the outbreak. This study investigated the relationship between college students' mental health status and psychological help-seeking behavior to test the phases-decision-making model (PDM). A cross-sectional survey was conducted among college students in Guangdong Province using an online platform. In total, 4,164 students were assigned to the &quot;counseling group&quot; or &quot;non-counseling group&quot; according to whether they had sought psychological help because of the COVID-19 outbreak; the groups were matched based on age, sex, and grade. Demographics, perceived mental health, and experience with seeking psychological help were recorded. Fear, depression, and trauma were assessed by the COVID-19 Fear Screening Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Impact of Event Scale-6. The fear, depression, and trauma scores were significantly higher in the counseling group than in the non-counseling group (<i>P</i><sub>s</sub> &lt; 0.001). Fear (OR = 1.27, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), depression (OR = 1.02, <i>p</i> = 0.032), trauma (OR = 1.08, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), poor perceived mental health status (OR = 3.61, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and experience with seeking psychological help (OR = 7.06, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) increased the odds of seeking psychological help. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the rate of psychological help-seeking was still low, and college students in poor psychological condition sought psychological counseling more. Fear, depression, trauma, experience with seeking psychological help, and perceived mental health can effectively predict psychological help-seeking behavior. These findings emphasized the importance of closely monitoring college students' psychological status, providing psychological intervention, and improving the probability of seeking psychological help.","Liang, Chen, Liu, Li, Chen, Tang, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02231","20201005","COVID-19; college students; fear; mental health; psychological help-seeking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5529,""

"Staying Physically Active During the Quarantine and Self-Isolation Period for Controlling and Mitigating the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Overview of the Literature","The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented worldwide public health concern. Characterized by rapid and high frequency human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization has recommended implementation of public health measures, including isolation of all suspected infectious individuals for a 14-day quarantine period, while governments have introduced &quot;social distancing&quot; and &quot;lock-downs&quot; of varying severity to curtail COVID-19 spread. Recent COVID-19 research further suggests there are major sleep problems and psychological disorders (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) associated with the reduction of movement and activities, as well as the reduced social interaction. There have been no studies examining the effect of physical activity at home during such periods of isolation. However, based on previous research, potential tactics to overcome these negative effects include home-based exercise, exergaming, dancing to music, and participation in yoga. Adults should accumulate at least 150 min of moderate-intensity and at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity of activity divided in to 5-7 sessions per week. This training volume could be reduced by 30% for children and adolescents if replaced by recess or active play in and around the home. Additionally, exercises should be adapted to the fitness level of the participant and a progressive model of intensity and training volume should be utilized, preferably monitored by telephone applications and wearable sensors.","Chtourou, Trabelsi, H'mida, Boukhris, Glenn, Brach, Bentlage, Bott, Shephard, Ammar, Bragazzi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01708","20201005","COVID-19; physical activity; psychology; quarantine; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5531,""
"Development and validation of the Lo's Healthy and Happy Lifestyle Scale (LHHLS): The resilience in general population facing COVID-19 in Taiwan","This article explores the effectiveness of development of the Lo's Healthy and Happy Lifestyle Scale (LHHLS), which is an evaluative tool that monitors the resilience of the Taiwan population in times of such COVID-19 epidemic. Also, to verify factors of resilience, namely the reliability and validity of self-efficacy and positive thinking, and establishment of a prospective norm analysis. The study mainly applied Explorative Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to develop LHHLS and establish the reliability and validity of the tool's structure, verify norm analysis and the reliability of data from each question using Cronbach's alpha. According to statistics, LHHLS has a good factorial effectiveness and relatively high reliability, with factor reliability analyses where Cronbach's alpha lies between 0.83 to 0.94. The 14 questions in the LHHLS has a total variance of 67.04%. The tool includes two sub-assessments that are theoretically and statistically appropriate: mental health/self-efficacy and positive thinking. The tool LHHLS can be applied to populations affected by COVID-19. With participants' self-awareness of mental health state and state of happy living, this tool is valid and reliable in assessing and evaluating the resilience of such participants against times of COVID-19. This study can become future use for epidemic prevention communities in monitoring residents' healthy living and changes in their resilience. Also, can become a reference standard for interventions to reduce the impacts populations' happy and healthy living, in times of biological disasters.","Lo, Hsieh, Lu, Shieh, Chou, Shieh","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020960771","20201005","COVID-19; Healthy and Happy Lifestyle Scale (LHHLS); positive thinking; resilience norm verification; self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-06","",5532,""
