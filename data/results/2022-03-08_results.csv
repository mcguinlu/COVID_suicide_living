"Social connections at work and mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from employees in Germany","Empirical evidence on the social and psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the workplace and the resulting consequences for the mental health of employees is still sparse. As a result, research on this subject is urgently needed to develop appropriate countermeasures. This study builds on Person-Environment fit theory to investigate social connections at work and mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It analyses employees needs for social connections and how social connections affect different mental health measures. Survey data were collected in May 2020 in an online survey of employees across Germany and analysed using response surface analysis. Mental health was measured as positive mental health and mental health disorders. Social connections were measured as social support and social interactions. 507 employees participated in the survey and more than one third reported having less social support and social interaction at work than they desired (p < .001). This was associated with a decrease in mental health. In contrast, having more than the desired amount of social support was associated with a decrease and having more than the desired amount of social interaction with an increase in mental health. This study provides important early evidence on the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the workplace. With it, we aim to stimulate further research in the field and provide early evidence on potential mental health consequences of social distancing measures - while also opening avenues to combat them.","Jonas Breetzke; Eva-Maria Wild","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.04.22270966","20220307","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",27992,""
"Substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: What is really happening?","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased levels of anxiety, fear, sadness, difficulty adjusting, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidality, both in the general population and specific subgroups. The presence of this type of psychopathology increases the risk of involvement with or worsens the use of addictive substances and alcohol as a maladaptive coping strategy.1 According to these data, people with substance use disorders are a population at high risk for COVID-19 infection and serious illness. ÃŽâ€˜ large controlled retrospective case study in the US found that people with substance use disorders are significantly more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications (primarily those with opioid use disorder OR = 10.21 and with tobacco use disorder OR = 8.25), and that the course and outcome of the disease (hospitalization, death) was worse than in non-dependent individuals. The main culprits are increased physical co-morbidity (frequent respiratory and cardiovascular problems), poor health and living conditions, marginalization and difficulties in accessing health services. 2,3 ÃŽâ„¢nternational epidemiological data during the first months of the pandemic regarding the use of addictive substances do not lead to safe conclusions. A cross-sectional online epidemiological study conducted on a sample of 36,538 adults from 21 European countries between April and July 2020 found an overall decrease in alcohol use, which was mainly attributed to the reduction of heavy episodic consumption, while at the same time an increase in alcohol consumption among people with severe alcohol use was recorded. ÃŽÂ¤he use of cannabis and nicotine showed increasing trends, as well as the use of cocaine, but to a lesser extent, while the use of MDMA (ecstasy) showed a decrease.4 In a review of 45 cross-sectional studies conducted between December 2019 and November 2020, alcohol use was on the rise overall, despite geographical variations, as was the use of other addictive substances, cannabis in particular.5 It should be noted that those who increased alcohol use during quarantine were those exhibiting higher levels of negative emotionality mechanisms.6 In Greece, an online cross-sectional survey in April 2020 in the general population during the first lockdown showed a reduction in alcohol use (43.7% of alcohol users reduced or quit), a reduction in cannabis (67.3% quit), while 33.3% increased nicotine use. These changes were attributed to the limitation of alcohol availability, social distancing, changes in daily routine and income reduction.7,8 Also, wastewater samples from Athens, analyzed by the Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry of EKPA, showed a significant increase in the use of cocaine (67%), amphetamine (350%) and methamphetamine (37%), and a decrease in the use of MDMA (- 38%) during the first lockdown, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.9 Analysis of wastewater samples from other European cities ""suggest that levels of use of most drugs appear generally lower during the initial lockdowns, but then appear to bounce back once lockdown was lifted. A comparison with 2019 appears to suggest similar overall consumption of most drugs, and in several cities possibly even higher levels, based on this data source. Exceptions here appear to be MDMA and methamphetamine, two drugs for which the levels observed in 2020 appear lower in most of the participating cities"".10,11 There were also changes in the locations of use of the substances, as with the periodic restrictions the use was transferred mainly at home and in open public spaces; in some cases, it was associated with increased intravenous use and cases of intoxication. Finally, intermittent difficulties in drug availability and trafficking have led users to search for other substances, increase experimentation and multidrug use, and make online purchases. In addition, there is concern about the increasing abuse of benzodiazepines, which are either diverted from therapeutic use or appear on the illicit market, often as new benzodiazepines.10,12 According to the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), ""the drug market has been remarkably resilient to disruption caused by the pandemic"" Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Drug trafficking has adapted to the new conditions with changes in routes and methods of trafficking, and by further enhancing the digital presence of the drug marketÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ ""Any reductions in drug consumption seen during the initial lockdowns rapidly disappeared as social distancing measures were eased. In general terms, there appears to have been less consumer interest in drugs usually associated with recreational events, such as MDMA, and greater interest in drugs linked with home use. However, the easing of restrictions Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ during the summer was associated with a rebound in the levels of use"". Also, ""survey data suggest that those using drugs occasionally prior to COVID-19 may have reduced or even ceased their use during the pandemic, but more-regular users may have increased their drug consumption"".10 Measures taken to control the pandemic have reduced and modified the mental health and addiction treatment services provided. Although services have been adequately restored, there has initially been a 60% reduction in the availability and provision of detoxification services in Europe.13 Live contact, mainly at group level, was significantly reduced or stopped altogether for a long period, as well as the frequency of individual appointments. Therapeutic programs sought to respond to the new conditions using technology and telemedicine, providing online group support and psychotherapy. Substitution treatment programs have become more flexible by providing long-term pharmaceutical substitutes (take home) to prevent users from moving. There have also been facilitations in prescribing by treating physicians. Thus, the addicts' contact with the treatment process was maintained, but it was insufficient to meet their increased needs during this period. In conclusion, it should be noted that substance use appears to have an autonomous dynamism in relation to the pandemic and the consequent psychopathology, being in a ""loose"" causal relationship with it. Therefore, hasty and untimely generalizations should be avoided, and easy conclusions should not be drawn through extrapolations from previous socio-economic crises of different types or through partial spatiotemporal understandings, which are usually presented by the media in the form of negative alarming information.","Mellos, Paparrigopoulos","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.072","20220307","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",27993,""
"Exhaustion and burnout in the healthcare system in Greece: A cross-sectional study among internists during the COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed everyday life around the world. The situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with severe mental health problems in frontline medical and nursing staff. The aim of this study was to investigate exhaustion, disengagement, secondary traumatic stress, compassion satisfaction, burnout, as well as depression, anxiety and stress among internists in Greece, during the second lockdown period. Internists were approached through the Internal Medicine Society of Greece and a total of 117 participated in the study (response rate: 15.3%). The participants responded through a Google form on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and the Professional Quality of Life Scale version 5 (ProQOL-5). Exhaustion was found in the majority of the participants (88%), 65.8% met the criteria for at least moderate levels of compassion satisfaction and 71.8% presented moderate levels of burnout. Furthermore, about half of the participants met the criteria for moderate to extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Finally, regression analyses showed that depression was associated with both the OLBI and ProQOL-5 scales. The majority of the internists, during the lockdown period in Greece, were evaluated as ""exhausted"", with high rates of negative psychological symptoms. The present study, despite the limitations, highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on internists, which triggered a shift in attention onto the treatment, and especially the prevention, of stressful situations for health professionals.","Karlafti, Benioudakis, Barouxi, Kaiafa, Didangelos, Fountoulakis, Pagoni, Savopoulos","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.067","20220307","COVID-19 pandemic; Greece; burnout; depression; exhaustion; internists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",27994,""
"Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein is a body fluid biomarker: A valuable prognostic for neurological disease - A systematic review","Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the human central nervous system, and they play an important role in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In neurological disorders, astrocyte disintegration leads to the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from tissue into the bloodstream. Elevated serum levels of GFAP can serve as blood biomarkers, and a useful prognostic tool to facilitate the early diagnosis of several neurological diseases ranging from stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. This systematic review synthesizes studies published between January 2012 and September 2021 that used GFAP as a potential blood biomarker to detect neurological disorders. The following electronic databases were accessed: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. In all the databases, the following search strategy was used: Ã‚Â¨GFAPÃ‚Â¨ OR Ã‚Â¨glial fibrillary acidic proteinÃ‚Â¨ AND Ã‚Â¨neurologicalÃ‚Â¨ OR Ã‚Â¨neurodegenerativeÃ‚Â¨ AND Ã‚Â¨plasmaÃ‚Â¨ OR Ã‚Â¨serumÃ‚Â¨. The initial search identified 1152 articles. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 48 publications that reported GFAP levels in neurological disorders were identified. A total of16 different neurological disorders that have plasmatic GFAP levels as a possible biomarker for the disease were described in the articles, being: multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, COVID-19, epileptic seizures, Wilson Disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, glioblastoma, spinal cord injury, asthma, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and Friedreich's ataxia. Our review shows an association between GFAP levels and the disease being studied, suggesting that elevated GFAP levels are a potentially valuable diagnostic biomarker in the evaluation of different neurological diseases.","Heimfarth, Passos, Monteiro, AraÃƒÂºjo, Quintans JÃƒÂºnior, Quintans","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2022.108624","20220307","Blood; COVID-19; GFAP; Intermediate filament; Neurodegeneration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",27995,""
"Students' negative emotions and their rational and irrational behaviors during COVID-19 outbreak","The pandemic has posed an intense threat to the mental health of younger adults. Despite significant efforts in studying various aspects of COVID-19, there is a dearth of evidence on how negative emotions are associated with behaviors. A comparison across associated factors to different negative emotions by means of a unified model is especially missing from the literature. This study was conducted by using the results of a survey conducted across 2,534 students enrolled in 7 states in the US. Various feelings such as sad, irritable, stress and guilt were analyzed in a unified model by means of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Questions were asked related to rationally limiting the spread of virus, and questions related to behaviors that seem to be extreme. Irrational behaviors, such as limiting exercise at home due to COVID-19 could be due to experiencing negative emotions, which distort the meaning of events for the students. That behavior, for instance, was found to be positively associated with various negative feelings. In addition, the results highlighted significant differences across emotions in terms of demographic characteristics such as gender and age, and various precautionary actions that students take, such as limiting outdoor activities or limiting social gathering. For instance, it was highlighted while avoiding a large group of people, in spite of its importance in curbing the spread of virus, is negatively associated with various negative emotions, taking a possible nonconsequential precaution of completely limiting all people outside the immediate family result in a higher level of negative emotions. Also, it was found that having a higher body mass index (BMI), self-rated worse health conditions, and limiting outdoor activities have detrimental effects on the mental health of students.","Rezapour, Dehzangi, Saadati","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264985","20220307","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",27996,""

"Effects of COVID-19 on Livelihood, Health, and Psychology of Hijra Population: Insights from Dhaka, Bangladesh","The COVID-19 lockdown in Bangladesh has left hijra individuals at an increased risk of poverty and food insecurity due to the economic crisis. COVID-19 challenges the fundamental foundation of the public health system, and now the hijra group is out of the system because of stigma and discrimination. This article features three focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted by 23 respondents about their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following research aimed to understand the health, mental stress, and social and economic effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the lives of deprived and marginalized hijra people in Bangladesh. The results reflect the effect of COVID-19 in terms of social, health care, and mental health problems on the hijra community in Bangladesh. In the aftermath of the pandemic, their disadvantaged and socially excluded status makes the hijra population more vulnerable to being affected by the virus and facing its economic and social impacts. The conclusion presents that hijra people are assumed to suffer under the severity of the pandemic even more than the general population due to the intersections between their status as a vulnerable social group and their high level of medical risk factors.","Sifat, Ahmed, Miah, Khisa","https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2022.2048162","20220307","Bangladesh; COVID-19; health; hijra; livelihood; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",27998,""

"COVID-19 stress, minority stress, and mental health among LGB Israeli individuals","The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide. Minorities are more vulnerable than the general public to the physical, financial, and psychological effects of the current pandemic. In the current study, mental health among Israeli LGB individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown was investigated. One-hundred and 57 lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals answered a questionnaire measuring COVID-19 stress, internalized homophobia, concealment, need of acceptance, anxiety, and depression. A structural equation model was conducted to test the proposed relations and mediating hypotheses. All three measures of minority stress were positively related to anxiety and depression. In addition, indirect associations were found between concealment and need of acceptance, and anxiety and depression, through stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings emphasize the ubiquity of minority stress, support the psychological mediation framework, and underline the need to investigate the effect of general and minority stress on the mental health of LGB individuals.

"Mental Health and Obesity During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the population. These are associated with unhealthy eating patterns and sedentary behaviour. In turn, this may increase risk of obesity or aggravate it. This narrative review discusses the link between adverse mental health states and weight related behaviours. We present emerging evidence for this phenomenon during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals with and without pre-existing obesity. A sizeable proportion of the population exhibits deterioration in mental health during the pandemic and those affected often report unhealthy weight-related behaviours such as ""junk food"" consumption and physical inactivity. Women, individuals with obesity, and those with pre-existing mental health conditions seem to be particularly at risk for overeating in response to stress (i.e. emotional eating). A number of psychological interventions including cognitive behavioural therapy and self-compassion may be effective in improving mental health and emotional eating patterns among the general population and particularly in individuals living with obesity. There is a need to complement efforts to improve mental health in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic with targeted action to improve physical activity levels and healthy eating particularly among groups at-risk. This may be achieved by reducing disruptions to specialist and primary healthcare services and facilitating access to psychological interventions that address stress-related eating behaviours. Additional studies that examine such interventions, especially those that are delivered remotely, are urgently needed.","Melamed, Selby, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-021-00466-6","20220307","COVID-19; Emotional eating; Mental health; Obesity; Pandemic; Stress; Weight","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28002,""
"Lack of social touch alters anxiety-like and social behaviors in male mice","The importance of social interactions has been reported in a variety of animal species. In human and rodent models, social isolation is known to alter social behaviors and change anxiety or depression levels. During the coronavirus pandemic, although people could communicate with each other through other sensory cues, social touch was mostly prohibited under different levels of physical distancing policies. These social restrictions inspired us to explore the necessity of physical contact, which has rarely been investigated in previous studies on mouse social interactions. We first conducted a long-term observation to show that pair-housed mice in a standard laboratory cage spent nearly half the day in direct physical contact with each other. Furthermore, we designed a split-housing condition to demonstrate that even with free access to visual, auditory, and olfactory social signals, the lack of social touch significantly increased anxiety-like behaviors and changed social behaviors. There were correspondingly higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in the hippocampus in mice with no access to physical contact. Our study demonstrated the necessity of social touch for the maintenance of mental health in mice and could have important implications for human social interactions.","Ma, Zeng, Chu, Lee, Cheng, Chen, Su, Lin, Kuo","https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2022.2047174","20220307","Social touch; anxiety-like behaviors; cytokines; social behaviors; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28003,""

"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers' psychological and mental health: The moderating role of felt obligation","The ravages of COVID-19 have created a worldwide emergency in healthcare units. Under these circumstances, the perception of an infection threat is primarily affecting the employees' performance in reducing contagion effects. The purpose of this study is to develop substantial measures of support for healthcare employees to maintain adequacy in job performance. Data were collected from state-owned hospitals in Pakistan to test the current study's proposed model. We applied structural equation modeling through a partial least square regression in addition to the blindfolding approach in Smart-PLS. Confirmatory factor analysis was also employed to measure the study's validity. The current study's findings show that the perception of a threat from COVID-19 and the inadequate protective measures have influenced frontline healthcare workers' performance levels. The mediating path of depression symptoms indicated the threat of COVID-19 and the absence of protective measures as potential determinants of poor performance. However, an employee's ability to feel obligated toward their job duties reduces the effect of depression on employee performance. The current model highlights an individual's feelings of obligation to maintain their performance level by minimizing the effect of depression and professional anxiety. The present study extensively described the psychological constraints healthcare workers are facing during the current pandemic. Current research addressing healthcare employees' mental health is vital for better prevention and control during pandemic circumstances.

This study makes use of qualitative research methods that involved collecting data from 355 full-time waiters via questionnaires on online platforms. The collected data suggests that the fear of COVID-19 has a significant negative impact on mental well-being. Morever, the data gathered for this study also indicates that the fear of COVID-19 infection differs significantly according to the fatalistic belief and psychological resilience levels of the waiters. Findings of this study indicate that the psychological effects of infectious diseases on individuals are not universal, but rather depend on the personal characteristics of individuals. It is hoped that the results of this study will contribute to the reduction of negative effects associated with the general anxiety of pandemic that individuals experience.","ÃƒÅ“ngÃƒÂ¼ren, Ceyhan, TÃƒÂ¼rker","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-211030","20220307","Fear of COVID-19; fatalism; mental well-being; psychological resilience.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28006,""
"COVID-19 and decent work: A bibliometric analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among these impacts, those related to the SDG 8 can be highlighted. Consequently, the literature has addressed aspects related to economic growth and decent work. This article aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on decent work according to the literature. For this, a bibliometric analysis was conducted. Data from Web of Science were collected, and VOSviewer software was used to perform the analysis. Regarding the results, four main clusters that govern the subject were identified. A first cluster (identified in red) evidenced the consequences of the pandemic to the generation of informal work, increasing poverty and the impacts on gender issues. A second cluster (identified in blue) addresses mental health and stress issues, especially for nurses professionals who experience a situation in the COVID-19 pandemic. The green cluster focused on unemployment, precarious employment, and work conditions, which were highly related to coronavirus contagion. Finally, the yellow cluster evidenced the final consequences when there is a substantial public health problem. The results presented here can be helpful to researchers interested in the, as it allows a broad and condensed view of important information about a relevant topic for sustainable economic development.","Anholon, Rampasso, Dibbern, Serafim, Filho, Quelhas","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210966","20220307","COVID-19; SDGs; Work conditions; decent work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28007,""
"College students' compliance with government measures for social isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak: A focus on psychological predictors","To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, government adopted several measures to restrict social contacts including isolation, quarantine, and limitations on movement from location to location around the country. To analyze the degree to which Italian college students agreed and complied with these measures and to determine if psychological variables have influenced compliance. We evaluated 6075 students concerning their agreement with the government's restrictions, as well as their health anxiety, trait positive and negative affect, and current symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. We performed MANOVAs, ANOVAs, path analysis, and binary logistic regressions. We found some differences in compliance with government restrictions concerning gender, geographic location, and major of study. Psychological variables did not play a significant role in predicting compliance with restriction measures and making a call for medical help. However, health anxiety predicted higher levels of worries about having contracted the virus. Based on our results, university-based interventions should primarily focus on males to foster compliance with government restriction during a pandemic, or health crisis. College students -Social Sciences students in particular -could benefit from counseling interventions to avoid the development of psychological disorders fueled by pandemic worries.","Loscalzo, Giannini","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210697","20220307","Health; lockdown; prevention; quarantine; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28008,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical and rehabilitation sciences university students in Saudi Arabia","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased stressful impact among different populations that are at an increased risk of mental health problems, such as university students. To investigate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical and rehabilitation sciences university students, explore the factors affecting them, and provide helpful recommendations for better mental health. An online survey was conducted with a sample of medical and rehabilitation sciences students. The anxiety visual analogue scale, the perceived stress scale (PSS), and the impact of events scale-revised (IES-R) were applied. A total of 244 students completed the survey (60.7% were female). The mean scores of total anxiety, PSS and IES-R were significantly higher in females than males. 34.5% and 29.4% of the students reported that their sleep and appetite were respectively disturbed during the pandemic. Students with adequate knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic reported a significant decrease in anxiety level (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.01), perceived stress (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.00), and less negative impacts of the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.01).

"Vaccination rates against COVID-19 in patients with severe mental illness attending community mental health services in rural Greece","Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) may be at increased risk for COVID-19-related severe morbidity and mortality. There is limited research on the vaccination rates against COVID-19 in patients with SMI. The objective of the present study is to explore vaccination rates and co-relations in patients with SMI, attending community mental health services, namely the Mobile Mental Health Units (MMHUs) in rural Greece. All treatment engaged patients with SMI (schizophrenia-spectrum or bipolar disorder) with two MMHUs (MMHU of Kefalonia, Zakynthos and Ithaca, [MMHU KZI] and MMHU of the prefectures of Ioannina and Thesprotia [MMHU I-T]) in rural Greece were enrolled prospectively over a six-month period. The MMHU I-T had adopted a more proactive approach to patients' vaccination, by informing patients and caregivers for its benefits. Data were analyzed for 197 patients with SMI. The overall vaccination rate was 68.5% and did not differ from the respective rates in the general population. There were no differences in vaccination rates among patients attending the two MMHUs, nor among patients with different diagnoses (schizophrenia spectrum disorders or bipolar disorder). Vaccination was not associated with gender, educational level, history of alcohol and substance abuse, illness duration, or number of previous hospitalizations, whereas the effect size of age was moderate. In more than half non-vaccinated patients the refusal to get vaccinated was associated with fears and concerns as well as false beliefs that are encountered in the general population. In the present sample of treatment-engaged rural patients vaccination rates against COVID-19 appear to be satisfactory. There were no differences in vaccination rates with regard to the interventions that were applied to enhance vaccination. It seems that other forms of intervention should be applied to reluctant patients to modify their attitudes toward vaccination.","Peritogiannis, Drakatos, Gioti, Garbi","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221081801","20220307","Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; rural areas; schizophrenia; severe mental illness; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28010,""
"COVID-related distress, mental health, and substance use in adolescents and young adults","This study examined the impact of COVID-related disruptions on mental health and substance use in young people residing in a state with an initially lower COVID burden and earlier reopening of in-person learning than other states. Data come from Waves 3 (Fall 2019) and 4 (Fall 2020) of the Policy and Communication Evaluation (PACE) Vermont, an online cohort study of adolescents (ages 12-17) and young adults (ages 18-25). Participants in Wave 4 (212 adolescents; 662 young adults) completed items on COVID-related stressors, the impact of the pandemic on their substance use, brief mental health scales, and past 30-day substance use. Analyses examined correlational and longitudinal relationships between COVID-related stressors, mental health symptoms, and substance use. More than 60% of participants noted negative effects of the pandemic on their physical, emotional, and social well-being, with greater impacts of COVID-related stressors in young adults than adolescents. There were significant increases in depressive (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03, 1.66) and anxiety symptoms (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.10, 1.64) in young adults between Fall 2019 and Fall 2020. Higher overall COVID Impact scores were associated with higher odds of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as past 30-day electronic vapor product use, in adjusted cross-sectional and longitudinal models. Robust associations between COVID-related distress, mental health, and substance use outcomes in young people signal the opportunity to increase evidence-based interventions while adding novel approaches to minimize longer-term harms of the pandemic on mental health in adolescents and young adults.","Villanti, LePine, Peasley-Miklus, West, Roemhildt, Williams, Copeland","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12550","20220307","Adolescent; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; substance use; young adult; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28011,""
"The interface of COVID-19, diabetes, and depression","Comorbid diabetes with depression is a challenging and often under-recognized clinical problem. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a communicable disease is thriving on the increasing incidences of these non-communicable diseases. These three different health problems are bidirectionally connected forming a vicious cycle. Firstly, depressed individuals show a higher risk of developing diabetes and patients with diabetes have a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression. Secondly, patients with diabetes have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 as well as of experiencing breakthrough infections. Thirdly, in both patients with type 2 diabetes and in COVID-19 survivors the prevalence of depression seems to be increased. Fourthly, lockdown and quarantine measurements during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in depression. Therefore, it is of importance to increase the awareness of this interface between depression, diabetes and COVID-19. Finally, as symptoms of post-COVID, diabetes and depression may be overlapping, there is a need for educating skilled personnel in the management of these comorbidities.","Steenblock, Schwarz, Perakakis, Brajshori, Beqiri, Bornstein","https://doi.org/10.1007/s44192-022-00007-0","20220307","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28012,""
"Social media and suicide in social movements: a case study in Hong Kong","Research has indicated that excessive and sensationalized suicide reporting can lead to copycat suicides, especially when deaths involve well-known people. Little is known, however, about the impact of the reporting of suspected protestor suicide deaths during social unrest, particularly in an age of social media. In June 2019, the most substantial social unrest in Hong Kong since its handover in 1997 was triggered by the proposed Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB). The social unrest subsided when Hong Kong and many parts of the world were hit by Covid-19 and very strict quarantine measures were imposed on crowd gatherings in Hong Kong at the end of January 2020. A number of reported suicides and deaths of undetermined cause took place during this 8-month period that received considerable attention. To better understand the possible effects of these highly publicized deaths,Ã‚Â we examined media reports ofÃ‚Â suspected suicide cases before, during and after the protest period, as well as topics of suicide-related threads and their replies in social media forums. We found no clear evidence of increased rates of suicide as a result of these incidents, or during the protest period; however, it is suggested that certain narratives and attention surrounding the suspected suicides and undetermined deaths may have contributed to collective emotions such as sadness and anxiety. Some implications for misinformation (intentionally or un-intentionally) and mitigation of suicide risk during social unrest are discussed.","Yip, Pinkney","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-022-00159-7","20220307","Protest; Social media; Social movement; Suicide; Suicide reporting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28013,""

"Health of International Migrant Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and control measures adopted have had a disproportionate impact on workers, with migrants being a group specifically affected but poorly studied. This scoping review aims to describe the evidence published on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of migrant workers. Papers written in English covering physical and mental health among international migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, retrieved from six electronic databases searched on July 31, 2021, were included. A total of 1,096 references were extracted, of which 26 studies were finally included. Most of the migrant populations studied were born in Asia (16 of 26) and Latin America (8 of 26) and were essential workers (15 of 26). Few studies described the length of stay in the host country (9 of 26), the legal status of the migrant population (6 of 26), or established comparison groups (7 of 26). Ten studies described COVID-19 outbreaks with high infection rates. Fourteen studies evaluated mental health (anxiety, depression, worries, fears, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder). Three of the 26 studies presented collateral positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic because of improved hygiene. There is a limited number of original publications related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of migrant workers around the world. These publications mainly focus on migrants born in Asia and Latin America. The physical, long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has, so far, not been evaluated.

"Global Research Trends in Pediatric COVID-19: A Bibliometric Analysis","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in 2019 and has since caused a global pandemic. Since its emergence, COVID-19 has hugely impacted healthcare, including pediatrics. This study aimed to explore the current status and hotspots of pediatric COVID-19 research using bibliometric analysis. The Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science core collection database was searched for articles on pediatric COVID-19 to identify original articles that met the criteria. The retrieval period ranged from the creation of the database to September 20, 2021. A total of 3,561 original articles written in English were selected to obtain data, such as author names, titles, source publications, number of citations, author affiliations, and countries where the studies were conducted. Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) was used to create charts related to countries, authors, and institutions. VOSviewer (Center for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden, The Netherlands) was used to create visual network diagrams of keyword, author, and country co-occurrence. We screened 3,561 publications with a total citation frequency of 30,528. The United States had the most published articles (1188 articles) and contributed the most with author co-occurrences. The author with the most published articles was Villani from the University of Padua, Italy. He also contributed the most co-authored articles. The most productive institution was Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. The institution with the most frequently cited published articles was Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. The United States cooperated most with other countries. Research hotspots were divided into two clusters: social research and clinical research. Besides COVID-19 and children, the most frequent keywords were pandemic (251 times), mental health (187 times), health (172 times), impact (148 times), and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) (144 times). Pediatric COVID-19 has attracted considerable attention worldwide, leading to a considerable number of articles published over the past 2 years.

"Regional Innovation in Arts Provision Spawned by COVID-19: ""It Became a Lifeline for a Lot of People Who Are Stuck at Home""","Although the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural sector due to the closure of galleries, museums, arts venues, and other cultural assets represents a significant health risk, new opportunities for arts and cultural engagement have arisen. Interviews with 24 representatives including service providers and creative practitioners from 15 arts and cultural organizations within the Liverpool City Region were conducted. The aim was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on arts and cultural provision and on organizations and people providing these services, as well as to understand the perceptions of service providers and practitioners of the effects on those whom arts and cultural organizations serve, including those who would usually access arts through formal healthcare routes (e.g., through collaboration with health partners). Interview data were analyzed using framework analysis. Four overarching themes were identified: Response: Closures, adaptations, and new directions; Challenges of online provision; Value of online provision; and the future of the arts. The arts and cultural sector has innovated rapidly, notably with accelerated digitalisation. Alternative provision has been ""a lifeline"" for vulnerable groups, such as those with mental health difficulties. Arts organizations have been most effective in reaching vulnerable, isolated and disadvantaged populations when they have worked in close collaboration with health and social care providers. The implementation of hybrid provision is an important move forward for the sector in light of our findings that alternative modes of provision are advantageous additions to service as usual. Given the increasing concerns about the mental health sequelae of the pandemic in the UK, arts and cultural engagement could play a pivotal role in the future recovery period.","Worsley, Billington, Balabanova, Watkins","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.753973","20220307","COVID-19; arts engagement; cross-sector collaboration; public mental health; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28017,""
"Pandemic or panic? A firm-level study on the psychological and industrial impacts of COVID-19 on the Chinese stock market","This study presents a thorough investigation of the relationship between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and daily stock price changes. We use several types of COVID-19 patients as indicators for exploring whether stock prices are significantly affected by COVID-19's impact. In addition, using the Chinese stock market as an example, we are particularly interested in the psychological and industrial impacts of COVID-19 on the financial market. This study makes two contributions to the literature. First, from a theoretical perspective, it shows a novel quantitative relationship between the psychological response to the pandemic and stock prices. In addition, it depicts the mechanism of the shock to the stock market by pointing out the specific functional expression of the impulse reaction. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical calculation of the impulse of a shock to the financial market. Second, this study empirically estimates the marginal effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on fluctuations in stock market returns. By controlling for stock fundamentals, this study also estimates diverse industrial responses to pandemic stock volatility. We confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused panic in the stock market, which not only depresses stock prices but also inflates volatility in daily returns. Regarding the impulse of the shock, we identify the cumulative level of the pandemic variables as well as their incremental differences. As shown by our empirical results, the terms for these differences will eventually dominate the marginal effect, which confirms the fading impulse of the shock. Finally, this study highlights some important policy implications of stock market volatility and returns to work in the industry.","Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-022-00335-8","20220307","Black swan event; COVID-19; Psychological and industrial impacts; Shocks; Stock market reaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28018,""

"Cognitive Health Worries, Reduced Physical Activity and Fewer Social Interactions Negatively Impact Psychological Wellbeing in Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus pandemic has significantly affected psychological wellbeing in older adults, with cases of depression, anxiety and loneliness rising in the general population. Cognitive health has also potentially been affected, as social isolation can lead to cognitive decline. Worrying about cognitive health can be damaging to psychological wellbeing and is especially relevant to explore in the context of the Coronavirus pandemic. The objective of the present study was to explore the associations between cognitive health worries and wellbeing, and to investigate whether physical activity and social contact can mitigate negative effects of the pandemic on psychological wellbeing. Older adults (<i>N</i> = 191) completed an online survey which included measures of cognitive health worries, depression, anxiety, loneliness, social isolation, fatigue, impact of the Coronavirus pandemic, quality of life, subjective vitality, and physical activity. Analyses indicated that cognitive health worries, lower levels of physical activity and smaller amounts of social interaction were associated with poorer psychological and physical wellbeing. Results showed that worrying about cognitive health is associated with poorer wellbeing, and so interventions are needed to encourage positive cognitive functioning in times of social isolation. Promoting physical activity and social interaction is also beneficial, as results show that exercise and social contact are linked with improved wellbeing.","Sutton, Catling, Segaert, Veldhuijzen van Zanten","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.823089","20220307","COVID-19; cognitive health worries; older adults; physical activity; psychological wellbeing; social interaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28020,""
"Changes in Physical Activity and Depressive Symptoms During COVID-19 Lockdown: United States Adult Age Groups","This study investigates: (1) the changes in three major health-related factors-physical activity, non-physical-activity health behavior (i.e., diet quality, alcohol consumption, smoking, sleep quality), and depressive symptoms, and (2) how changes in physical activity were associated with changes in one's depressive symptoms among young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults while controlling non-physical-activity health behavior and sociodemographic characteristics among young, middle-aged, and older adults before and after the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown in the United States. A total of 695 participants completed an online questionnaire <i>via</i> MTurk, and participants were asked to recall their physical activity, depressive symptoms, and non-physical-activity health behavior status in January and May of 2020. The IPAQ-SF was used to evaluate individuals' physical activity, while the CES-D-10 was used to assess depressive symptoms. Covariates included non-physical-activity health behavior and sociodemographic factors. A Bayesian significance testing of changes was used to examine significant changes in physical activity, non-physical-activity behavior, and depressive symptoms in each age group while Bayesian regression analysis was employed to examine how the changes in physical activity were associated with respondents' depressive symptoms while controlling for individual NHB and sociodemographic characteristics. The results showed that the participants tended to maintain their physical activity levels after the lockdown despite significant increases in sitting time among young and older adults. Decreases in moderate physical activity frequency were associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 17.1%). Although young and middle-aged cohorts experienced fewer differences in depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts in the older group, we found no significant heterogeneity effects in the relationships of interest across all age groups. Considering different influences of physical activity on depressive symptoms depending on different levels of activity and ages, more randomized clinical trials with program-based intervention studies should be conducted with different physical activity programs for different age populations.","Kim, Du, Andrew","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.769930","20220307","COVID-19; depressive symptom; health behavior; mental health; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28021,""
"Psychological Support in a COVID-19 Hospital: A Community Case Study","Burnout is a well-documented entity in Care Workers population, affecting up to 50% of physicians, just as it is equally well established that managing an infectious disease outbreaks, such as confirmed in the COVID-19 pandemic, increases Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the psychological burden. Mental health support, in the form of formal or remote sessions, has been shown to be helpful to health care staff, despite the organizational difficulties in an emergency. During the first emergence of COVID-19 in Italy, the Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care <i>Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation</i> (Pavia, Lombardy), the Italian hospital that treated ""patient 1,"" has activated an agreement with the <i>Soleterre Foundation</i>, an international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that manages health emergency projects, to provide psychological support. A task force of psychologists was created with the aim of designing and administering a <i>Therapeutic Mental Health Assessment for COVID-19 Care Workers</i> (TMHA COVID-19 CWs) to evaluate and support health care workers' mental health. The assessment battery was developed to evaluate symptoms and behaviors associated with trauma and the corresponding maladaptive behaviors (the National Stressful Events Survey for PTSD-Short Scale ""NSESSS"" and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ""DSM-5"" Self-Rated Level 1 transversal Symptom Measure-Adult). Once the TMHA COVID-19 CWs had been developed, the team of psychologists regularly visited healthcare staff in the ward to administer it. One hundred seven care workers (44 males, mean age 40 Ã‚Â± 15) across Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the emergency room and medical ward were administered the TMHA COVID-19 CWs. PTSD symptoms were reported as severe by 13% of the population. Depressive symptoms as severe for 7% and Anxiety symptoms as severe for 14%. Severe psychotic symptoms were experienced by 2% and severe suicidal thoughts by 1% of the population. The possibility of acting upon the results of the TMHA COVID-19 CWs allowed an early intervention through individual session beyond the cut-off level (moderate and severe symptoms) for PTSD in NSESSS. In fact, 280 individual support sessions were offered. Therefore, we considered our project a protective and support factor for healthcare workers' mental well-being and we recommend implementing a mental health screening program in ward involved in COVID-19 patients' care.","Rizzi, Asperges, Rovati, Bigoni, Pistillo, Corsico, Mojoli, Perlini, Bruno","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.820074","20220307","COVID-19; health care staff; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28022,""
"Stress and Sleep Disorders in Polish Nursing Students During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic-Cross Sectional Study","The world pandemic of the virus SARS-CoV-2 , which causes COVID-19 infection was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Due to the restrictions that were introduced in order to minimize the spread of the virus, people more often suffer from stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. The aim of this study was evaluation of the stress levels and sleep disorders among nursing students during the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 . This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 397 nursing students on March 2020. The research tools used were original questionnaires, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10), and the Athenian Insomnia Scale (AIS), as well as Coping with Stress Inventory (MiniCOPE). Respondents felt a high level of stress, which occurred in 68.8% of interviewees regarding whether there was a danger of contracting COVID-19. Respondents experienced 84% stress levels when a family member suffered from COVID-19. Sleep disorders were determined mainly by the fear of infection and contact with someone who might be infected with the virus. Nursing students who felt a high level of stress often suffered from sleep disorders (70.2%) more frequently than students who felt a low or average stress level (30.4%). The respondents decided to cope with stress by denial, taking psychoactive substances, ceasing action, or blaming themselves. The greater the intensity of stress experienced by students, the more often they undertook avoidance behaviors or showed helplessness. During the pandemic, students experienced severe stress, which resulted in sleep disorders and avoidance behaviors.","Bodys-Cupak, Czubek, Grochowska","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.814176","20220307","SARS-CoV-2; coping; pandemic; sleep disorder; stress; student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28023,""

"Changes in Psychiatric Inpatient Service Utilization During the First and Second Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused societal restrictions and public fear which may have impacted the pattern of seeking psychiatric care. There has generally been a decrease in the numbers seeking acute psychiatric care. It is important to investigate which groups seeking psychiatric treatment have decreased in number. The aim of our investigation was to identify which groups have a changed pattern in acute psychiatric service utilization during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study investigated changes in the rate and pattern of visits and hospital admissions for psychiatric disorders at a large Swedish hospital. A register-based study was conducted using administrative data on adult psychiatric emergency department visits (PEVs) and hospital admission rates. Data during the first two COVID-19 waves were compared to corresponding control periods in 2018-2019. Furthermore, a survey was performed among patients visiting the Psychiatric Emergency Department on their views of COVID-19 and acute psychiatric care. During the COVID-19 periods, PEVs were reduced overall by 16 and 15% during the first and second wave, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 in both cases), while the rate of admissions remained unaltered. PEVs were significantly reduced for most psychiatric diagnosis subgroups except for patients with schizophrenia and other related psychotic disorders as well as for those who required ongoing outpatient care. Most of the survey respondents disagreed that the pandemic affected their visit and about a quarter thought a video call with a doctor could have replaced their visit. In conclusion, there was a significant reduction in overall PEVs during both COVID-19 waves but this did not affect the numbers requiring admission for psychiatric inpatient care.","Hamlin, Ymerson, Carlsen, Dellepiane, Falk, Ioannou, Steingrimsson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.829374","20220307","COVID-19; acute psychiatric services; digital psychiatry; mental health; psychiatric admission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28025,""
"Psychometric Properties of the Bangla Version of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Items Scale Among the General Population in Bangladesh","Any disease outbreak creates psychological stress and anxiety among the public [e.g., Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. There are several scales that assess anxiety specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6) scale is a reliable and valid tool to assess anxiety in any viral pandemic. The present study aims to validate the SAVE-6 scale in the Bangla language and culture, to assess such anxiety among the general Bangladeshi people. The SAVE-6 scale was translated into Bangla from English using the forward-backward translation procedure. A total of 357 Bangladeshi citizens participated via an online structured questionnaire. The items included questions on personal information, COVID-19 and vaccination, psychiatric history, the Bangla version of the SAVE-6 scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9) scale. Both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to explore and confirm the single factor structure of the SAVE-6 scale in Bangla to be the same as that of the SAVE-6 scale. Multigroup CFA revealed invariance across sex, experience of being quarantined, experience of being infected, and presence of depression. Item analysis results showed good discrimination indices and internal consistency and reliability. The graded response model outputs also confirmed the validity and reliability of this scale, which had significant correlations with the GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Overall, the Bangla version of the SAVE-6 is a psychometrically good scale to assess viral pandemic-related anxiety.","Ahmed, Hossain, Hiramoni, Siddique, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.804162","20220307","COVID-19; anxiety; epidemics; psychological; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28026,""
"Perceived Academic Stress, Causes, and Coping Strategies Among Undergraduate Pharmacy Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Academic stress is a common problem among medical students, and the COVID-19 health crisis lockdown further worsened it. High academic stress has a negative impact on students learning and overall performance. To assess perceived academic stress, causes, and coping strategies among undergraduate pharmacy students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Khartoum. Data were collected from randomly selected participants using three validated self-administered questionnaires; perceived stress scale, study habits inventory, and mental health inventory. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, and descriptive statistics and chi-square were employed. The response rate in our study was 99.6% (251/252). About 87% of the participants were females. The majority of participants (92%) experience academic stress, with a mean score (24.99 Ã‚Â± 5.159), the level of academic stress ranging from low (4.3%), moderate (73.2%), to high (22.5%). Approximately 80% of the percipients reported academic stress during all exam times with a mean score (25.33 Ã‚Â± 4.976). The level of academic stress was significantly associated with participants' gender (P-value: 0.042), and living conditions (P-value: 0.001). The most common factors that were significantly associated with academic stress were difficulty in remembering all that is studied (66.7%, P=0.006) and worrying about the exams (54.1%, P=0.011). Moreover, the most frequent strategies used to cope with academic stress were praying (84.4%) and maintaining some control over the situation (61.9%). The study revealed a high prevalence of academic stress among percipients. Academic counseling, monitoring of mental status, and implementation of stress reduction programs are highly recommended.","Yousif, Arbab, Yousef","https://doi.org/10.2147/AMEP.S350562","20220307","COVID-19; Sudan; academic stress; exam stress; pharmacy students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28027,""
"Assessing the Psychological Impact of the Pandemic COVID -19 in Uninfected High-Risk Population","To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psyche of uninfected people with chronic diseases in the Elduim community, White Nile State, Sudan, during the COVID -19 pandemic. We used a generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD -7) and a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) for psychological assessment. The study included two hundred thirty-four participants; all participants with a chronic disease but not infected with COVID -19 were between 24 and 65 years of age. Residents of the study area were randomly selected. Descriptive statistics and a <i>t</i>-test were used for associations with a p-value of 0.05 or less. This study found that anxiety rated by GAD 7 was either mild (18, 7.7%), moderate (98, 41.9%), or severe (41, 17.5%) among participants. PHQ 9-rated depression showed 22 (9.4%) mild depression, most of them in participants aged 36-44 years. Participants with kidney disease showed major depression 11 (42.31%). Factors that significantly affected anxiety scores were age 24-35 years (P =0.002), university graduates (P &lt; 0.000), married (P &lt; 0.000), those with diabetes and hypertension (P =0.041), and urban residents (P &lt; 0.023). Those who had secondary education were married and smoked were significantly more likely to have major depression than those with another educational status (p &lt; 0.05).

"The factor structure and measurement invariance of the PHQ-4 and the prevalence of depression and anxiety in a Southeast Asian context amid the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined the psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) as an ultra-brief screener of depression and anxiety in the PhilippinesÃ‚Â during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data from 4,524 non-clinical community respondents aged 18-73 years oldÃ‚Â was collected onlineÃ‚Â between March and July 2020. We evaluated the screener's factor structure, measurement invariance, and criterion-related validity using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multigroup CFA, and structural equation modeling (SEM), respectively. We also evaluated the accuracy of the PHQ-4 cut-off scores by comparing the them with the screeners' full scales (i.e., PHQ-9 and GAD-7). Using the cutoff scores of the screeners, we also estimated the prevalence ratesÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â depression and anxiety. The PHQ-4 has good internal reliability (Cronbach's ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.82). The CFA results show that the two-factor model has an excellent model fit that is superior to the one-factor model. The two-factor model held through increasingly constrained multigroupÃ‚Â CFA models across gender, age, and geographical location groups, demonstrating measurement invariance. The SEM model supported the PHQ-4's theoretical association to stress, negative affect, and positive affect, supporting the screener'sÃ‚Â criterion-related validity. In estimating prevalence rates, among those screened by the PHQ-4 cut-off scores for depression (<i>n</i> = 1,905, 42.11%) and anxiety (<i>n</i> = 1,853, 40.96%), 81.78% and 94.06% were consequently screened by the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively. This study supports the reliability, validity, and measurement invariance of the PHQ-4 as an ultra-brief screener of depression and anxietyÃ‚Â in a large community sample in Southeast Asia. The inclusion of ultra-brief screeners in COVID-19-related studiesÃ‚Â and other human disasters, especially among non-clinical samples in low- and middle-income countries, is relevant for the sustainableÃ‚Â evaluation and monitoringÃ‚Â of the severityÃ‚Â mental health symptomsÃ‚Â leading to timely and effective mental health serviceÃ‚Â provision.","Mendoza, Frondozo, Dizon, Buenconsejo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-02833-5","20220307","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Measurement invariance; PHQ-4; Philippines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28029,""
"Mental health among theÃ‚Â general population and healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis of well-being and psychological distress prevalence","The COVID-19 pandemic has constituted a global health crisis that has threatened the mental health of individuals worldwide. The present paper sought to systematically review and meta-analyze studies reporting the prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic of well-being and psychological distress as defined by the dual-continua model, which includes (absence of) psychological distress and (presence of) well-being among the general population and healthcare workers. Systematic searches were conducted in various databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception until 6 December 2020. From a total of 158 studies (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°880,352) included in the meta-analysis, only seven reported the prevalence of well-being. A random-effect model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence among the general population and healthcare workers on depression (25%; 31%), anxiety (27%; 31%), stress (35%; 32%), and well-being (52%; 45%), respectively. Sub-group analyses based on region, income, percentage of women, preparedness of country to respond to COVID-19, and economic vulnerabilities were conducted in order to examine sources of heterogeneity in psychological distress. Results revealed differences among the two groups and indicated that disparities in terms of preparedness to fight the pandemic can distinctly affect mental health in the general population and healthcare workers. Addressing mental health during and after a health crisis should be in the spotlight of the international and national public health agenda. Considering the protective role of well-being to minimize psychological symptoms, mental health policies during the COVID-19 should include strategies to combat the psychological consequences of the pandemic by promoting well-being practices.

"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in individuals with pre-existing mental illness","There is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected mental health, but most studies have been conducted in the general population. To identify factors associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals with pre-existing mental illness. Participants (N = 2869, 78% women, ages 18-94 years) from a UK cohort (the National Centre for Mental Health) with a history of mental illness completed a cross-sectional online survey in June to August 2020. Mental health assessments were the GAD-7 (anxiety), PHQ-9 (depression) and WHO-5 (well-being) questionnaires, and a self-report question on whether their mental health had changed during the pandemic. Regressions examined associations between mental health outcomes and hypothesised risk factors. Secondary analyses examined associations between specific mental health diagnoses and mental health. A total of 60% of participants reported that mental health had worsened during the pandemic. Younger age, difficulty accessing mental health services, low income, income affected by COVID-19, worry about COVID-19, reduced sleep and increased alcohol/drug use were associated with increased depression and anxiety symptoms and reduced well-being. Feeling socially supported by friends/family/services was associated with better mental health and well-being. Participants with a history of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or eating disorder were more likely to report that mental health had worsened during the pandemic than individuals without a history of these diagnoses. We identified factors associated with worse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals with pre-existing mental illness, in addition to specific groups potentially at elevated risk of poor mental health during the pandemic.","Lewis, Lewis, Roberts, Richards, Evison, Pearce, Lloyd, Meudell, Edwards, Robinson, Poole, John, Bisson, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.25","20220307","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; pre-existing mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28031,""
"Variations in COVID-19 vaccination uptake among people in receipt of psychotropic drugs: cross-sectional analysis of a national population-based prospective cohort","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected people with mental health conditions. We investigated the association between receiving psychotropic drugs, as an indicator of mental health conditions, and COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort of the Northern Ireland adult population using national linked primary care registration, vaccination, secondary care and pharmacy dispensing data. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses investigated the association between anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and hypnotic use and COVID-19 vaccination status, accounting for age, gender, deprivation and comorbidities. Receiving any COVID-19 vaccine was the primary outcome. There were 1 433 814 individuals, of whom 1 166 917 received a COVID-19 vaccination. Psychotropic medications were dispensed to 267 049 people. In univariable analysis, people who received any psychotropic medication had greater odds of receiving COVID-19 vaccination: odds ratio (OR) = 1.42 (95% CI 1.41-1.44). However, after adjustment, psychotropic medication use was associated with reduced odds of vaccination (ORadj = 0.90, 95% CI 0.89-0.91). People who received anxiolytics (ORadj = 0.63, 95% CI 0.61-0.65), antipsychotics (ORadj = 0.75, 95% CI 0.73-0.78) and hypnotics (ORadj = 0.90, 95% CI 0.87-0.93) had reduced odds of being vaccinated. Antidepressant use was not associated with vaccination (ORadj = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.03). We found significantly lower odds of vaccination in people who were receiving treatment with anxiolytic and antipsychotic medications.

"Effects of COVID-19-related stress and fear on depression in schizophrenia patients and the general population","This study compared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related stress, fear of infection, loneliness, and depression between patients with schizophrenia and the general population. A face-to-face survey was administered to 1340 patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and online survey of the general population (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2000) was conducted. The information gathered included the level of COVID-19-related stress, fear of infection, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score, and the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale score. Structural equation modeling revealed a significant effect of fear of COVID-19 infection on depression among the general population and on loneliness among patients with schizophrenia. Loneliness experienced during COVID-19 exacerbated depression in both groups. In the COVID-19-related stress-loneliness-depression pathway, the partial mediating effect of loneliness was significant in both groups. Conversely, in the COVID-19-related fear-loneliness-depression pathway, the full mediating effect of loneliness was only significant in patients with schizophrenia. In conclusion, the loneliness associated with COVID-19-related stress and fear of infection was an important factor influencing depression, and the impact was greater in patients with schizophrenia compared with the general population. Thus, different mental health intervention plans are needed for patients with schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the long-lasting COVID-19 pandemic, social support and provision of mental health services to prevent loneliness and consequent depression are required in patients with schizophrenia.","Lee, Chung, Kim, Kang, Lee, Lee, Lee, Jung, Hyun, Jhon, Kim, Ryu, Lee, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41537-022-00213-3","20220306","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28033,""
"Manifesto of the pediatricians of Emilia-Romagna region, Italy, in favor of vaccination against COVID in children 5-11Ã‚Â years old","Following the authorization by the regulatory authorities of vaccination against COVID for children aged between 5 and 11, in Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy, the pediatricians of the Italian Society of Pediatrics (SIP), the Italian Society of Neonatology (SIN), the Cultural Association of Pediatrics, the Italian Federation of Pediatricians (FIMP) and the Italian Union of Family Pediatricians (SIMPeF), who work in the hospital and in the territorial setting, have made a univocal and convinced appeal in favor of vaccination also in this age group. In order to contribute to a conscious choice, on the part of parents, based on exhaustive and correct information, a 24-point manifesto was developed. The manifesto showed that vaccines against COVID are the most effective and safest tool we have to counter the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination against COVID is a right of children just as it is for adults. Children between 5 and 11Ã‚Â years are not protected from the virus and a large part of the newly infected is this age. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection is certainly more benign in children, in some cases it can cause a serious pathology and long COVID. The stress caused by the pandemic, the prolonged closure of schools and the interruption of sports and recreational activities have had a devastating effect on the mental health of children and on the development of their personality. Vaccinating children against COVID serves to protect them from severe forms of disease and long COVID, allowing them to attend school face-to-face and lead a normal social life. The safety of vaccinatin is very high and vaccines against COVID have no influence on fertility nor can they cause developmental or growth side effects. The manifesto highlighted that the vaccine against COVID for children aged between 5 and 11 is effective and safe and represents an extraordinary gift for safeguarding health of the younger ones. The invitation, therefore, to parents is to have their children vaccinated against COVID as early as possible.","Esposito","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-022-01229-2","20220306","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccines; Caccine hesitancy; Children; Paediatric infectious diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28034,""

Out study aimed to characterize how medical students were affected by the pandemic, specifically how limitations introduced by the pandemic may have affected the quality, delivery, and experience of medical education. Three hundred students from 5 U.S. allopathic medical schools were surveyed to determine students' perceptions about their quality of medical education, professional development, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2020-December 2020). A large majority of students report that while lecture-based learning has not been significantly affected by the pandemic, small-group and clinical learning have greatly declined in quality. Students also reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and uncertainty with regards to their futures as physicians. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the medical student education and wellbeing. Although medical schools have implemented measures to continue to train medical students as effectively as they can, further strategies must be devised to ensure the well-being of students in the present and for future national emergencies.","Chakladar, Diomino, Li, Tsai, Krishnan, Zou, Kharidia, Baig, Householder, Kuo, Chandrasekar, Chang, Ongkeko","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03197-x","20220306","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Medical education; Pandemic; Student wellbeing; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28035,""
"Ecological momentary intervention to enhance emotion regulation in healthcare workers via smartphone: a randomized controlled trial protocol","CUIDA-TE is an APP that offers transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy focused on enhancing emotion regulation. As a novelty, it incorporates ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which can provide psychological support in real time, when suffering arises. The main goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CUIDA-TE to improve emotion regulation in healthcare workers, a population that has been particularly emotionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) the study sample will be composed of a minimum of 174 healthcare workers. They will be randomly assigned to a 2-month EMI group (CUIDA-TE APP, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°58), a 2-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA) only group (MONITOR EMOCIONAL APP, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°58), or a wait-list control group (no daily monitoring nor intervention, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°58). CUIDA-TE will provide EMI if EMA reveals emotional problems, poor sleep quality/quantity, burnout, stress, or low perceived self-efficacy when regulating emotions. Depression will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include emotion regulation, quality of life, and resilience. Treatment acceptance and usability will also be measured. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at the 3-month follow-up for all groups. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that evaluates the efficacy of an APP-based EMI to improve emotion regulation skills in healthcare workers.

"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Children in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","With its global spread and protracted threat, mounting morbidity and mortality, pervasive social and economic ramifications, vital public health measures, and often compromised risk communication, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk to children's emotional health relative to more common biological, natural, and man-made events. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTSD symptoms have been the primary focus of child disaster mental health research. The adult literature has questioned the appropriateness of focusing on PTSD in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, because most of the extensive adult research on PTSD has not appropriately assessed all diagnostic criteria for the disorder.<sup>1</sup> The pandemic experiences of participants in most studies examined in a recent review did not meet the PTSD exposure criterion,<sup>1</sup> which requires that exposure be ""directly"" experienced, witnessed in person, secondary to the involvement of a close family member or friend, or ""repeated or extreme"" contact with ""aversive details"" of the event.<sup>2 (page 271)</sup> Instead, participants' experiences were primarily indirect (eg, media contact) and constituted fear related to contracting the disease.<sup>1</sup> This concern extends to the relatively few empirical COVID-19 studies of PTSD in children and exemplifies a problem in many child disaster mental health studies, especially those assessing general population samples that primarily comprise children who do not meet the PTSD exposure criterion.","Pfefferbaum","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2022.02.007","20220306","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","",28037,""
