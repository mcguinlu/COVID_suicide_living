"The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms of pregnant and non-pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading worldwide, with a staggering number of cases and deaths. However, available data on the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on pregnant women are limited. The purposes of this study were to assess the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms among pregnant women, and to compare them with non-pregnant women. From February 28 to March 12, 2020, a cross-sectional study of pregnant and non-pregnant women was performed in China. The online questionnaire was used to collect information of participants. The mental health status was assessed by patient health questionnaire, generalized anxiety disorder scale, insomnia severity index, somatization subscale of the symptom checklist 90, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist-5. Totally, 859 respondents were enrolled, including 544 pregnant women and 315 non-pregnant women. In this study, 5.3%, 6.8%, 2.4%, 2.6%, and 0.9% of pregnant women were identified to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, physical discomfort, insomnia, and PTSD, respectively. However, the corresponding prevalence rates among non-pregnant women were 17.5%, 17.5%, 2.5%, 5.4%, 5.7%, respectively. After adjusting for other covariates, we observed that pregnancy was associated a reduced risk of symptoms of depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23; 95% CI: 0.12-0.45), anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26; 95% CI: 0.16-0.42), insomnia (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.58), and PTSD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15; 95% CI: 0.04-0.53) during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our results indicate that during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, pregnant women have an advantage of facing mental problems caused by COVID-19, showing fewer depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms than non-pregnant women.","Zhou, Shi, Liu, Peng, Wang, Qi, Li, Yang, Ren, Song, Zeng, Qian, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01006-x","20200920","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-21","",4974,""
"Improved night shift schedule related to the mortality of critically ill patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019","To determine the relationship between the improved night shift schedule and the mortality of critically ill patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). According to the time of the implementation of the new night shift schedule, we divided all patients into two groups: initial period group and recent period group. The clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were reviewed. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to determine the risk factors associated with in hospital death. A total of 75 patients were included in this study. Initial period group includes 45 patients and recent period group includes 30 patients. The difference in mortality between the two groups was significant, 77.8% and 36.7%, respectively. Leukocytosis at admission and admitted to hospital before the new night shift schedule were associated with increased odds of death. Shift arrangement of medical staff are associated with the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19. The new night shift schedule might improve the continuity of treatment, thereby improving the overall quality of medical work and reducing the mortality of critically ill patients.","Zhang, Xu, Wu, Wang, Su, Han, Xi, Zhu, Gao, Wang, Hu, Liu, Zhong, Ran, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.010","20200920","COVID-19; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2; Shift work; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-21","",4975,""

"Risk factors associated with loneliness, social isolation, and neuroticism in the UK Biobank cohort","Amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for establishing knowledge about risk factors for adverse health outcomes associated with loneliness and social isolation. In this study, we show that self-perceived loneliness coincides with objective measures of social isolation as well as the personality trait neuroticism, and that these comorbidities contribute to differential associations with risk factors including depression, social deprivation, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular risk, and aging of the brain. The findings contribute to identifying groups of individuals who may be vulnerable to loneliness and associated health problems, and emphasize the need for public-health initiatives addressing socioeconomic conditions as well as social, mental, and physical health to reduce the risk of loneliness and adverse health outcomes in the population.","Ann-Marie G De Lange et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-183-FF0","20200921","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; lifestyle behavior; depression; mental health; cardiovascular risk; risk factors; neuroticism; brain aging; loneliness; social isolation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-21","",4979,""
"The predictive effect of quarantine regulations and anxiety on curiosity during the emerging infectious disease outbreak","With the world-wide implementation of quarantine to suppress the spread of the COVID-19, people, having weathering a hard time, are confronted with an alarming state of mental health. For people who have taken self-quarantine at home for a long time, the anxiety and the new â€œstaying home normalityâ€ may undermine their desire to seek information and thus might have negative effects on their curiosity. Here, we explored and examined how anxiety and the effect of quarantine regulations during the public health emergency predict different kinds of curiosity. With 1071 participants, we conducted an exploratory study (N = 570) and a confirmatory study (N = 501), with measures of anxiety, curiosity, interpersonal distancing and autistic tendency etc. There are three main findings in our results: (1) trait anxiety had negatively indirect impact on trait curiosity and the time spent on update of the COVID-19 information, however, no such correlation was found between state anxiety and epistemic curiosity; (2) state anxiety has negatively indirect impact on perceptual curiosity through increasing interpersonal distancing during quarantine; (3) interpersonal distancing and autistic tendency have negatively indirect impact on interpersonal curiosity. These effects suppressed the positive prediction of anxiety to interpersonal curiosity. Our research provides insights for the relationship between quarantine, anxiety and curiosity during the COVID-19.","Qi Huang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46111-9BD-9D8","20200920","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; quarantine; curiosity; interpersonal distancing; anxiety; covid-19; autism","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-21","",4980,""
