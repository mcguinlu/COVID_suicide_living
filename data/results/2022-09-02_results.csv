"Racism and Racial Injustice During COVID-19: Impact on University Student Mental Health","The purpose of the study is to understand how undergraduate, graduate, and professional students were affected by the events of racial injustice and the COVID-19 pandemic. Data gathered from an online campus-wide survey administered during July and August 2020 indicated high levels of stress and rates of depression across all stages of training. A majority of these students also indicated that, while events around racism negatively impacted their mental health, such events did not affect student academic success as COVID-19 did. Although previous studies have demonstrated that student mental health has been negatively affected during COVID-19, this study shows that student mental health is also impacted by events driven by racism and racial injustice concurrent to the pandemic. In light of these findings, it is recommended that institutions adopt an intersectional approach toward addressing such contemporaneous stressors with initiatives that can adapt to multiple events simultaneously.","Laurence M.

"Awareness, Social Media, Ethnicity and Religion: are they Responsible for Vaccination Hesitancy? A Systematic Review with Annotated Bibliography","Vaccination is not only a medical term rather it is framed under socio-cultural perspectives and debates as well. Human history is full of illnesses caused bacteria and viruses killing millions of people including children and adults. Technological development in the health sector enabled to combat pathogenic illnesses through different methods whereby vaccination is one of them. However, it is a dilemma that vaccination has faced many barriers including logistical but most importantly sociocultural and religious. In 2019, WHO revealed vaccine hesitancy as a leading threat to health throughout the globe even in the top 10. This study looks to analyze peer reviewed literature to explore barriers to vaccination. Methodologically, this is desk research and systematic review. Numerous databases were searched with key words and purposively studies were selected for this study. A total of 17 most relevant studies were sampled. Findings show that there are four major factors hindering vaccination. 1st cultural and ethnic background matters whereby religion and the belief system are predominant factors. 2nd awareness and educational variables are also there, for instance, it is noted that many people are not aware of vaccination process specifically in case of HPV vaccination. 3rd social media plays a pivotal role whereby misinformation internalizes negative attitudes and misperceptions about vaccines. 4th social media is a key dimension whereby disinformation and misinformation are communicated through platforms whereby some are intentionally circulated. It is suggested that culturally relativism perspective can be helpful in increasing vaccination percentages. It pertains to intervention through culturally approved methods, for example, sensitizing the ethnic backgrounds through their leadership. In addition, vaccination tracking, media campaigns, focus on school level education to include health related course can be helpful.","Khan, Nasar, Hussain, Naila, Naz, Arab","https://doi.org/10.22359/cswhi_13_4_04","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Social Work and Health Intervention; 13(4):18-23, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36935,""
"Public Perceptions of Local Parks and Recreation as an Essential Community Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant economic challenges to state and local governments, resulting in funding cuts for many government services, including parks and recreation (Young, 2020). As park and recreation agencies work to sustain and increase funding during and beyond the pandemic, it is important to understand the perceptions of key decision-making stakeholders and document the contributions of parks and recreation during the pandemic. Local residents are a primary stakeholder for municipal parks and recreation who have the potential to influence funding and policy through their participation, voting, and advocacy. Research has suggested that individuals are more likely to support parks and recreation and view them as essential when they perceive they provide benefits that address their own as well as broader community needs. Parks and recreation have previously been identified as valuable contributors to health, and as such, these services may have provided essential benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. This panel study investigated Pennsylvania residents and the extent they considered parks and recreation an essential community service during the COVID-19 pandemic. It further assessed the rationale for why parks and recreation were considered either essential or non-essential during this time period. A majority of respondents (54%) felt local parks and recreation were an essential service in their community during the pandemic. People who recently used parks and people with higher incomes and levels of education perceived parks and recreation to be more essential during COVID-19. When asked why they considered parks and recreation to be essential, respondents discussed contributions to physical health, mental health and well-being, the safe provision of recreation opportunities, and social and community connectedness. Conversely, parks and recreation were considered non-essential when they had been closed, when individuals were unsure of what services were actually provided during the pandemic, or they were perceived as unsafe or unsanitary given the presence of COVID-19. Findings provide evidence of the contributions provided by local parks and recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest influenceable factors associated with perceptions of whether parks and recreation are an essential community service.

"Reflections On COVID-19: FCS and Social Entrepreneurship: Partners in Crisis","Loss of life, unemployment, reduced global trade, and changing consumer behavior could contribute to an economic recession on a scale not observed since the Great Depression of the 1930s, particularly if infection rates spike further (Congressional Research Service, 2020). Micro-level decisions to alter individual and family purchase behavior through reacting, coping, and adaptation mechanisms will continue to influence macro-level financial uncertainty (Kirk & Rifkin, 2020).

"Analysis of correlation between occupational stress and influencing factors of employees of a power supply company in Guangdong: based on effort-reward imbalance model","[Background] With the rapid development of China's economy, the working pressure of occupational population has increased rapidly, and the impacts of occupational stress on the physical and mental health of occupational population are becoming an important public health issue. Power supply companies are high risk industries of occupational stress covering many stressors. At present, no systematic research on occupational stress among workers in power supply companies has been reported, especially the impacts of occupational hazardous factors on occupational stress of workers. [Objective] The study aims to obtain the current status of occupational stress, explore the correlation between occupational stress and influencing factors, and provide a basis for formulating occupational stress intervention measures through a questionnaire survey of employees of a power supply company in Guangdong. [Methods] A cross-sectional study design was adopted and 1 091 employees of a power supply company in Guangdong were selected in May 2019. A general information questionnaire tailored to power supply companies was designed and distributed to collect basic information of the subjects. Occupational stress was assessed by effort-reward imbalance (ERI) index[ERI=effort score/(reward scorex0.545 4)] of ERI scale, and ERI index &gt; 1 was defined as having high occupational stress. Chi-square test was used to compare the differences of occupational stress rate among groups with different individual characteristics, occupational characteristics, lifestyles, and exposures to occupational hazardous factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of high occupational stress. [Results] A total of 1 091 questionnaires were distributed in this survey, and 972 (89.1%) valid questionnaires were returned. The respondents included 859 men (88.4%) and 113 women (11.6%). There were 514 (52.9%) subjects with high occupational stress. The prevalence rate of high occupational stress were higher in men than in women, higher among married employees than among single employees, higher in employees at and over 30 years of age than in those below 30 years, higher in dispatching and maintenance workers than in other types of workers, higher in high-income-level employees than in low-income-level employees, higher in employees with &lt; 6h sleeping time than in those with &gt;7 h, higher in employees with alcohol consumption than in those without, and higher in those exposed to noise, electromagnetic radiation, high temperature and high altitude, and visual display terminal than in those not;these differences were all statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). The logistic regression analysis results showed that compared with the workers at the age of &lt; 30 years, those at the age of 30-years and 40-years had a higher risk for high occupational stress (OR=2.438, 95% CI:1.507-3.943;OR=2.407, 95% CI:1.472-3.934, respectively);compared with customer service and other types of workers, the maintenance and dispatching workers had a higher risk for high occupational stress (OR=1.841, 95% CI:1.140-2.973;OR=2.417, 95% CI:1.149-5.083, respectively);compared with the employees who slept &gt;7h every day, those who slept &lt; 6h and 6-7h every day had a higher risk for high occupational stress (OR=1.735, 95% CI:1.182-2.547;OR=1.518, 95% CI:1.069-2.115, respectively);compared with those without visual display terminal exposure, the employees with such exposure had a higher risk for high occupational stress (OR=1.419, 95% CI:1.043-1.932). [Conclusion] The employees of the selected power supply company generally have a high rate of high occupational stress. Aged above 30 years, at maintenance and dispatch positions, with short sleeping duration, and with exposure to visual display terminal are risk factors of high occupational stress.","Liu, Bin, Chen, HuiFeng, Yan, XueHua, Huang, ZiPei, Yu, RiAn","https://doi.org/10.13213/j.cnki.jeom.2020.19582","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Environmental & Occupational Medicine; 37(3):225-230, 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36939,""
"Confinement et risque de burnout des dirigeants propriÃ©taires de PME : le syndrome dâ€™Ã©puisement dâ€™empÃªchement","En utilisant lâ€™Ã©chelle BMS-10 (burnout measure short, version composÃ©e de dix Ã©lÃ©ments) mesurant le burnout, il est montrÃ© que son niveau a augmentÃ© et sa composition a changÃ© chez les dirigeants propriÃ©taires de PME franÃ§aises pendant la pandÃ©mie de Covid-19. Sept Ã©chantillons indÃ©pendants de propriÃ©taires de petites entreprises collectÃ©s sur une pÃ©riode allant de 2012 Ã  fin avril 2020 (un mois aprÃ¨s le dÃ©but du premier confinement en France) sont Ã©tudiÃ©s. Avant la pandÃ©mie, la hiÃ©rarchie des Ã©lÃ©ments est en grande partie la mÃªme avec les sentiments dâ€™Ãªtre fatiguÃ©, dâ€™Ãªtre dÃ©Ã§u et dâ€™en avoir marre qui se positionnent comme les trois plus importants. Pendant la pandÃ©mie, une nouvelle hiÃ©rarchie Ã©merge, dont les deux Ã©lÃ©ments les plus importants sont les sentiments dâ€™impuissance et dâ€™Ãªtre coincÃ©. Cela indique une nouvelle forme dâ€™Ã©puisement dâ€™empÃªchement. Deux leÃ§ons peuvent Ãªtre tirÃ©es. Tout dâ€™abord, les autoritÃ©s gouvernementales et sanitaires doivent Ãªtre conscientes du risque dâ€™Ã©puisement professionnel croissant des dirigeants propriÃ©taires de PME pendant la crise de la Covid-19 et, en particulier, lors des Ã©pisodes de confinement. DeuxiÃ¨mement, en supposant quâ€™un propriÃ©taire de PME peut Ãªtre confrontÃ© Ã  une situation dâ€™incapacitÃ©, due Ã  un accident ou Ã  une maladie, les institutions dâ€™assurance maladie devraient Ãªtre alertÃ©es sur la possibilitÃ© de mettre en place de nouveaux services dâ€™Ã©coute et dâ€™accompagnement afin dâ€™Ã©viter la dÃ©tÃ©rioration de la santÃ© mentale liÃ©e Ã  lâ€™Ã©puisement dâ€™empÃªchement. Cette Ã©volution semble si grave et spÃ©cifique que le terme Â« syndrome dâ€™Ã©puisement dâ€™empÃªchement Â» est proposÃ©.Alternate :Using the BMS-10 scale (Burnout Measure Short version composed of ten Ã©lÃ©ments) it is shown that its level increased and its composition changed in French SME owners-managers from before to during the Covid-19 pandemic. Seven independent samples of SME owners-managers collected over a period from 2012 to the end of April 2020 (one month after the start of the first lockdown in France) are investigated. Before the pandemic the hierarchy of Ã©lÃ©ments is largely the same with feelings of being tired, of disappointment with people and of exhaustion (â€œIâ€™ve had itâ€) as the three most important ones. During the pandemic a new hierarchy appears with feelings of helplessness and being trapped as the two most important Ã©lÃ©ments. This points at an unprecedented form of impediment exhaustion. Two lessons can be drawn. First of all, the governmental and health authorities should be aware of the risk of an increasing burnout for SME owners-managers during the Covid-19 crisis and in particular during lockdown episodes. Secondly, by assuming that a SME owner-manager can be confronted with a situation of incapacity, due to an accident or an illness, pension and health insurance institutions should be alerted about the option to set up novel consultation and support services in order to prevent the deterioration of mental health related to impediment exhaustion. This development seems so severe and so specific that the term impediment exhaustion syndrome is proposed.Alternate :Utilizando la escala BMS-10 (Burnout Measure Short version compuesta por diez Ã­tems), se muestra que el nivel ha aumentado y su composiciÃ³n ha cambiado en los dirigentes-propietarios de PyME francesas durante la pandemia del Covid-19.

Antes de la pandemia, la jerarquÃ­a de los elementos era en gran medida la misma, con sentimientos de fatiga (me siento fatigado), decepciÃ³n (me siento decepcionado) y cansancio (Â«estoy hartoÂ») clasificados como los tres mÃ¡s importantes. Durante la pandemia, una nueva jerarquÃ­a emerge cuyos dos elementos mÃ¡s importantes son la sensaciÃ³n de impotencia y de estancamiento. Esto apunta a una forma sin precedentes de agotamiento de impedimento. De este episodio, pueden sacarse dos enseÃ±anzas.

En segundo lugar, asumiendo que el dirigente-propietario de PyME pueda estar confrontado a una situaciÃ³n de incapacidad, debido a un accidente o una enfermedad, se debe alertar a las instituciones de seguridad social sobre la posibilidad de establecer nuevos servicios de consulta y apoyo para prevenir el deterioro de la salud mental relacionado con el agotamiento por impedimento.

"Sustainable Statehood: Reflections on Critical (Pre-)Conditions, Requirements and Design Options","Thirty years after the seminal UN conference on environment and development, where the global agenda for sustainable development was agreed upon by the international community, uncountable initiatives in public policy, business and civil society have been activated. Despite all efforts, pressure on life-supporting Earth systems remain on an ecologically, socially and economically unsustainable pathway. Global collective action for sustainable development has so far been insufficient regarding the scientifically well-diagnosed need for substantial transformation. Given that the world remains a world of nation states, notwithstanding processes of globalization and transnationalization, internationalization and subnationalization, the quest for sustainable statehood is of utmost importance. Based on the expectations of nation states expressed in the UN Transformation Agenda 2030, it is argued that underlying and cross-cutting structures, procedures and instruments of statehood, which precede decision-making processes and policy-making in specific fields of sustainable development, such as climate change or biodiversity, are of key relevance. In this regard critical requirements and (pre-)conditions for sustainable statehood are discussed and design options for sustainable statehood in the Anthropocene are proposed.","Heinrichs, Harald","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14159461","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(15):9461, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36944,""
"Knowledge Management-Based Mental Health Service Model: Sustainable Application during College Studentsâ€™ Education","In order to meet the dynamic mental health needs of college students, it is important to promote quality mental health services and to improve the development view of college studentsâ€™ mental health. This paper uses a knowledge management method to construct college studentsâ€™ developmental mental health service model. The model is informed by knowledge management, which comprehensively considers service-related components, namely, resources, content, approach, process, personnel, and objects. Furthermore, knowledge management constructs the system structure of the model and expands the research ideas and contents of the service resource pool. Moreover, knowledge management supports the platform, core technology system, and service process in the model. Finally, using Suzhou University as an example, this study examines the implementation and application of the service model to test the effectiveness of the knowledge management method. Thus, this study provides theoretical and methodological support for the construction, implementation, and application of a sustainable mental health service model for college students.","Zhang, Cuixia, Yang, Yaliu, Liu, Conghu","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14159008","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(15):9008, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36945,""
"Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis with Articulatory-Level Feedback Generation for Non-Native Arabic Speech","A high-performance versatile computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) system that provides the learner immediate feedback as to whether their pronunciation is correct is very helpful in learning correct pronunciation and allows learners to practice this at any time and with unlimited repetitions, without the presence of an instructor. In this paper, we propose deep learning-based techniques to build a high-performance versatile CAPT system for mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) and articulatory feedback generation for non-native Arabic learners. The proposed system can locate the error in pronunciation, recognize the mispronounced phonemes, and detect the corresponding articulatory features (AFs), not only in words but even in sentences. We formulate the recognition of phonemes and corresponding AFs as a multi-label object recognition problem, where the objects are the phonemes and their AFs in a spectral image. Moreover, we investigate the use of cutting-edge neural text-to-speech (TTS) technology to generate a new corpus of high-quality speech from predefined text that has the most common substitution errors among Arabic learners. The proposed model and its various enhanced versions achieved excellent results. We compared the performance of the different proposed models with the state-of-the-art end-to-end technique of MDD, and our system had a better performance. In addition, we proposed using fusion between the proposed model and the end-to-end model and obtained a better performance. Our best model achieved a 3.83% phoneme error rate (PER) in the phoneme recognition task, a 70.53% F1-score in the MDD task, and a detection error rate (DER) of 2.6% for the AF detection task.","Algabri, Mohammed, Mathkour, Hassan, Mansour, Alsulaiman, Bencherif, Mohamed A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/math10152727","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mathematics; 10(15):2727, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36946,""
"Afferent and efferent projections of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in young and middle-aged mice","Research shows that across life, the incidence of mental illness is highest in the young. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues of the young in particular have received global attention. The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) plays an important role in psychiatric disorders and chronic pain-psychiatric comorbidities. However, it remains unknown whether or how the afferent and efferent circuits of the rACC change with aging. In this study, we microinjected a retrograde tracer virus and an anterograde trans-monosynaptic virus into the rACC of young and middle-aged mice (both male and female), and systematically and quantitatively analyzed the whole-brain afferent and efferent connections of rACC at different ages and sexes. Notably, in young and middle-aged mice, afferents of the rACC belong to four groups of brain structures arising mainly from the amygdala (mainly basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (BLA)) and cerebral cortex (mainly orbital cortex), with a small part originating from the basal forebrain and thalamus. In contrast, efferents of the rACC belong to four groups of brain structures mainly projecting to the thalamus (mainly ventral anterior-lateral/ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VAL/VM)), with a very small part projecting to the amygdala, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex. Compared with young mice, the BLA-rACC circuit in middle-aged mice (male and female) did not change significantly, while the rACC-VAL/VM circuit in middle-aged mice (male and female) decreased significantly. In conclusion, this study comprehensively analyzed the input-output neural projections of rACC in mice of different ages and sexes and provided preliminary evidence for further targeted research.","Ma, Xinyi, Yu, Wei, Yao, Pingâ€™an, Zhu, Yichen, Dai, Jiale, He, Xiaofen, Liu, Boyu, Xu, Chi, Shao, Xiaomei, Fang, Jianqiao, Shen, Zui","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2022.960868","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36947,""
"The capacity to adapt: Documenting the relationship between stressors and probable depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress at two time points during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychological adaptability, or the reduction of psychiatric symptoms in the context of ongoing stressors, is well-documented. The present study assessed relationships between COVID-19 related stressors and depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress (PTS) during April and July 2020. Prevalence of, and changes in, symptom severity levels in April vs. July were measured with ANOVA F-tests and logistic regressions were used to assess the odds of probable diagnosis. Symptom distributions skewed lower in July, as compared to April for all three diagnostic categories. From April to July, prevalence of probable anxiety and depression decreased across all levels of stress, prevalence of PTS increased for high stress, and decreased for medium and low stress levels. In July, only high stress related to higher odds of probable diagnoses, as compared to April when both medium and high stress did. Due to use of cross-sectional self-report data, the present findings could not establish causality between variables, and could provide probable, rather than clinical, diagnoses. Findings emphasize adaptability phenomena during COVID-19 and highlight the nuanced impact of ongoing stress.","Rudenstine, Schulder, Bhatt, McNeal, Ettman, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.120","20220901","Anxiety; Assets; COVID-19; Depression; Post-traumatic stress; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36948,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Recent Earthquake in Zagreb Together Significantly Increased the Disease Severity of Patients with Atopic Dermatitis","Stress may affect patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the earthquake in Zagreb, Croatia (March 2020), on AD patients and their disease severity, symptoms/itch, and perceived stress. Our observational cross-sectional study included three groups of AD patients diagnosed by a physician: group 1 (n = 50), who experienced both the pandemic (quarantine) and the earthquake; group 2 (n = 50), who experienced only the pandemic; and group 3 (n = 50), the comparison group, who experienced neither disaster (patients examined 2018-2019). Groups 1 and 2 were examined May-June 2020, immediately after the national lockdown/quarantine. Disease severity (SCORAD), data from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and information on patients' confirmed allergies were recorded for all groups, while groups 1 and 2 additionally completed a questionnaire concerning their disease, hand hygiene, and experience during the pandemic and/or earthquake. The patients exposed to both disasters reported more pronounced AD worsening (p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.388) and more frequent itching (p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.350) than those exposed to the pandemic only. Notably, we found certain differences by gender: during the pandemic, women significantly more frequently washed their hands (81% of women washed ""very frequently,"" while 52% of men washed ""quite often"") and had significantly higher PSS levels than men (p &lt; 0.05). Concerning allergies, present or absent, during the pandemic, there was no significant difference in SCORAD between groups 1 and 2, neither when analyzed separately for indoor nor for outdoor allergens. The most commonly reported psychological disturbances during the pandemic were concern (46%), anger (18%), anxiety (16%), depression (9%), and increased alcohol, cigarette, and opioid agent use (6%). The COVID-19 pandemic together with the earthquake significantly increased disease severity and influenced AD worsening, itching, and psychological disturbances. This indicates that stressful events meaningfully affect the course of AD.","LugoviÃ„â€¡-MihiÃ„â€¡, MeÃ…Â¡troviÃ„â€¡-Ã…Â tefekov, CvitanoviÃ„â€¡, Bulat, DuvanÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡, Pondeljak, ToluÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡-Levak, LaziÃ„â€¡-Mosler, Novak-BiliÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1159/000525901","20220901","Atopic dermatitis; COVID-19; Disease severity; Earthquake; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36949,""
"DECREASED GUT MICROBIOME TRYPTOPHAN METABOLISM AND SEROTONERGIC SIGNALING IN PATIENTS WITH PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS AFTER COVID-19","An estimated 15%-29% of patients report new gastrointestinal symptoms after COVID-19 while 4% -31% report new depressive symptoms. These symptoms may be secondary to gut microbiome tryptophan metabolism and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-based signaling. This study utilized specimens from 2 patient cohorts: (1) fecal samples from patients with acute COVID-19 who participated in a randomized controlled trial testing prebiotic fiber; and (2) blood samples from patients with acute COVID-19. Six months after recovering from COVID-19, both cohorts answered questions related to gastrointestinal symptoms and anxiety or depression. Microbiome composition and function, focusing on tryptophan metabolism-associated pathways, and plasma 5-HT were assessed. In the first cohort (n=13), gut microbiome L-tryptophan biosynthesis during acute COVID-19 was decreased among those who developed more severe gastrointestinal symptoms (2.0-fold lower log activity comparing those with the most severe gastrointestinal symptoms versus those with no symptoms, P=0.06). All tryptophan pathways showed decreased activity among those with more GI symptoms. The same pathways were also decreased in those with the most severe mental health symptoms after COVID-19. In an untargeted analysis, 5 additional metabolic pathways significantly differed based on subsequent development of gastrointestinal symptoms. In the second cohort (n=39,), plasma 5-HT concentration at the time of COVID-19 was increased 5.1-fold in those with gastrointestinal symptoms alone compared to those with mental health symptoms alone (P=0.02). Acute gut microbiome-mediated reduction in 5-HT signaling may contribute to long-term gastrointestinal and mental health symptoms after COVID-19. Future studies should explore modification of 5-HT signaling to reduce post-COVID symptoms.","Blackett, Sun, Purpura, Margolis, Elkind, O'Byrne, Wainberg, Abrams, Wang, Chang, Freedberg","https://doi.org/10.14309/ctg.0000000000000524","20220901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36950,""

"It's made a really hard situation even more difficult: The impact of COVID-19 on families of children with chronic illness","For over two years, the global COVID-19 pandemic has forced major transformations on health, social, and educational systems, with concomitant impacts on mental health. This study aimed to understand the unique and additional challenges faced by children with chronic illness and their families during the COVID-19 era. Parents of children receiving treatment for a chronic illness within the neurology, cancer, renal and respiratory clinics of Sydney Children's Hospital were invited to participate. We used qualitative methodology, including a semi-structured interview guide, verbatim transcription, and thematic analysis supported by QSR NVivo. Thirteen parents of children receiving tertiary-level care, for nine chronic illnesses, participated. Parents reported intense fears relating to their ill child's additional vulnerabilities, which included their risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease and the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to accessing clinical care, medications, allied health support and daily care protocols should their parent contract COVID-19. Parents perceived telehealth as a highly convenient and preferred method for ongoing management of less complex healthcare needs. Parents reported that the accrual of additional stressors and responsibilities during the pandemic, experienced in combination with restricted social interaction and reduced access to usual support networks was detrimental to their own mental health. Hospital-based visitation restrictions reduced emotional support, coping, and resilience for both parents and children and in some cases led to marital discord, sibling distress, and financial loss. Supportive factors included increased time spent together at home during the pandemic and improved hygiene practices at school, which dramatically reduced the incidence of non-COVID-19-related communicable illnesses in chronically ill children. For families caring for a chronically ill child, COVID-19 made a difficult situation harder. The pandemic has highlighted the need for targeted psychosocial intervention for vulnerable families, to mitigate current mental health burden and prevent chronic psychological distress.","McLoone, Wakefield, Marshall, Pierce, Jaffe, Bye, Kennedy, Drew, Lingam","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273622","20220901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36952,""
"Increases in Circulating Cortisol during the COVID-19 Pandemic are Associated with Changes in Perceived Positive and Negative Affect among Adolescents","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread across the world and resulted in over 5 million deaths to date, as well as countless lockdowns, disruptions to daily life, and extended period of social distancing and isolation. The impacts on youth in particular are astounding, with shifts in learning platforms, limited social outlets, and prolonged uncertainty about the future. Surveys have shown that mental health among youth has severely suffered during the pandemic. However, limited research to date has reported on physiological indices of stress surrounding the pandemic, such as cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone that typically increases during stressful situations and can have deleterious effects on mental and physical health when chronically heightened. The present study leveraged hair cortisol concentration measurements, which allowed the retrospectiveinvestigation of circulating cortisol prior to- versus after pandemic-related local lockdowns during the first wave of the pandemic. A final sample of 44 youth ages 10- to 18-years-old provided hair samples and reported on their perceived affective well-being and level of concern regarding pandemic-related stressors between May and June of 2020. We found significant levels of concern and decreases in affective well-being following local lockdowns. Moreover, we saw that cortisol robustly increased following local lockdowns, and those increases were predictive of changes in affect. These findings provide critical insights into the underlying neuroendocrinology of stress during the pandemic and support the need for resources to support youths' mental health and well-being during this globally significant event.","Taylor, Fung, Frenzel, Johnson, Willett, Badura-Brack, White, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-022-00967-5","20220901","Coronavirus; Hair cortisol concentration (HCC); Longitudinal; Mental health; Stress; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36953,""
"Child Anxiety and Depression Symptom Trajectories and Predictors over 15 Months of the Coronavirus Pandemic","Repeated measures are required to monitor and map trajectories of mental health symptoms that are sensitive to the changing distal and proximal stressors throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding symptoms in young children is particularly important given the short- and long-term implications of early-onset internalizing symptoms. This study utilized an intensive longitudinal approach to assess the course and environmental correlates of anxiety and depression symptoms in 133 children, ages 4-11 (M<sub>age</sub> = 7.35, SD = 1.03), in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers completed 48 repeated assessments from April 7, 2020, to June 15, 2021, on child and caregiver mental health symptoms, family functioning, and COVID-19-related environmental changes. Results from a series of multilevel growth models demonstrate that child depression symptoms were highest following initial stay-at-home orders (April 2020) and linearly decreased over time, while child anxiety symptoms were variable over the 15-month period. Caregiver depression symptoms and family conflict significantly predicted levels of child depression symptoms. In contrast, caregiver depression symptoms, caregiver anxiety symptoms, and time spent home quarantining significantly predicted levels of child anxiety symptoms. Results suggest that depression and anxiety symptoms in young children may have unique trajectories over the course of the coronavirus pandemic and highlight symptom-specific risk factors for each symptom.","Gruhn, Miller, Machlin, Motton, Thinzar, Sheridan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-022-00963-9","20220901","Anxiety; COVID-19; Child; Depression; Pandemic; Trajectories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36954,""

Generally, the research has found decreased physical activity and increased sedentary behavior, both of which are associated with various psychological outcomes. The research on sedentary behavior has focused on screen time with minimal consideration of other sedentary behaviors or of specific physical activities or the context in which these behaviors occurred. Changes in children's daily routines and activities have received little attention in the mass trauma research despite the fact that disasters disrupt individual, family, and community life.

"Role of anti-Asian racism for subjective well-being among people of Asian origin in Germany","People of Asian origin in Germany are affected by racial-ethnic discrimination, which became even more evident in the context of surging anti-Asian racism (AAR) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of discrimination can pose a threat to mental health. This study tested the role of discrimination experiences for subjective well-being in a sample of Asian origin people in Germany. A total of 671 participants (76.5% women) who self-identified as being of Asian origin participated in an online survey in December 2020. Participants completed several measures of racial-ethnic discrimination experiences, some of which were related to the pandemic (e.g., experienced microaggressions and perceived change in discrimination experiences during the pandemic), as well as indicators of subjective well-being (positive and negative affect, life satisfaction, and subjective health status). In structural equation models, discrimination experiences were associated with lower subjective well-being (<i>b</i> = -.36, <i>SE</i> = .16, <i>p</i> &lt; .05). A follow-up analysis suggested that this relationship was evident for discrimination measures that had a reference to the pandemic as well as measures without this reference. The range of different discrimination experiences among people of Asian origin in Germany is characterized by discrimination in the context of the pandemic and also beyond, and these may have a significant negative impact on the mental health of those affected. The findings of this study have practical implications both for reducing anti-Asian stigmas in society and in the context of psychological counseling of affected individuals, which should target the maintenance or improvement of subjective well-being.

"Use of telemental health for VA family services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Military veterans experiencing relationship or family difficulties are able to access family services (i.e., couple and family therapy) through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System. Although family services have historically been provided face-to-face (F2F), the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a sudden shift to the provision of care via telemental health, which includes videoconferencing (TMH-V) or audio-only phone appointments. This study demonstrated an unprecedented 16-fold increase in the number of TMH-V appointments for family services in VA during the first 9 months of the pandemic. The present study also examined demographic, mental health, and military variables associated with TMH-V utilization before and during the pandemic using a large national VA data set of 13,344 veterans who were referred to couple or family therapy from October 2017 through December 2020. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of having any appointments via TMH-V before and during COVID-19, respectively, as well as predictors of having 50% or more of family service appointments via TMH-V versus phone versus face-to-face appointments during the COVID-19 era. Pre-COVID predictors of TMH-V utilization were limited to obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosis and history of psychiatric hospitalization, suggesting that TMH-V usage was largely related to clinical indications. In the COVID-19 era, older and rural veterans were less likely to attend appointments via TMH-V than younger and suburban/urban veterans, while Hispanic veterans were more likely to do so than non-Hispanic veterans. The findings from the present study may aid efforts to ensure equity in access to care among veterans in the VA Health Care System.

"Changes in the food and drink consumption patterns of Australian women during the COVID-19 pandemic","This paper uses data from the seventh fortnightly Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey sent to women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health to investigate the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the food and drink consumption of women born in 1946-51, 1973-78 and 1989-95. A survey about changes in fruit, vegetable, discretionary food, takeaway and sugary drink consumption during the pandemic was emailed on 22 July 2020 to 28,709 women in three cohorts of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Thematic qualitative analysis was conducted on comments about changes in consumption, and basic quantitative analysis was included for context. There were significant associations between age and all categories of food and drink consumption. Women wrote of lifestyle changes and choices during lockdowns, comfort and emotional eating, and access to food and drink changing their consumption behaviours. The COVID-19 pandemic and interventions had both positive and negative impacts on the food and drink consumption behaviours of Australian women. These findings can be used to directly influence practice around healthy food and drink consumption, highlighting enablers, including being at home, and barriers, including mental health, that should be considered.","Tolhurst, Princehorn, Loxton, Mishra, Mate, Byles","https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13295","20220901","Australia; COVID-19; drink consumption; food consumption; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36959,""
"'My biggest fear is that people will forget about him': Mothers' emotional transitions after terminating their pregnancy for medical reasons","To explore women's emotional responses throughout the process of terminating a pregnancy for medical reasons. Making the choice to terminate a desired pregnancy for medical reasons has a negative impact on women's health, as it is a distressing process that involves making hard decisions and readjusting one's expectations of an idealised pregnancy. A qualitative phenomenological study was conducted following the COREQ checklist. Fifteen semi-structured interviews and two focus groups were conducted with women who had terminated their pregnancies for medical reasons, previous to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Subsequently, we analysed the content. One main category, emotional journey during the process of terminating the pregnancy, and six subcategories were identified: (I) representation and desire to become a mother, (II) main concerns, (III) impact of the news, (IV) decision-making, (V) emotional responses before termination for medical reasons and (VI) emotional responses after termination for medical reasons. All contributed to understanding the specificities of the different phases that make up the emotional journey of terminating a pregnancy for medical reasons. The findings of this study suggest that there are a number of predominant emotions that professionals need to be aware of in order to help women work through them and lessen the impact of pregnancy termination on their mental health. COVID-19 had different connotations depending on the women's experiences. Our results highlight how important the role of healthcare staff is in caring for these women and their partners, which involves recognising their emotions throughout the process. Our results also underline how useful it is to conduct qualitative studies in this context, since they constitute a set of activities and interventions that result in the administration of nursing care in itself. The ultimate goal of the action research study is to design a positive mental health intervention. Participants will contribute to the design and final approval of the intervention.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Ramos, Zuriguel-PÃƒÂ©rez, Collado-Palomares, CasadÃƒÂ³-MarÃƒÂ­n","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16504","20220901","COVID-19; Prenatal diagnosis; congenital abnormalities; decision-making; eugenic abortion; pregnancy; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36960,""
"mRNA and Viral Vector COVID-19 Vaccines Do Not Affect Male Fertility: A Prospective Study","To assess whether mRNA and viral vector coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines detrimentally affected semen parameters. In this prospective study, we enrolled 101 men vaccinated for COVID-19 (76% received mRNA vaccines, 20% viral vector vaccines, 2% a mixed formulation, and for 2 men no information about vaccine type was available) in 2021 and with a previous semen analysis. For each man we compared semen parameters before and after vaccination. Post-vaccine samples were obtained at a median of 2.3Ã‚Â±1.5 months after the second dose. After vaccination, the median sample volume significantly decreased (from 3.0 to 2.6 mL, p=0.036), whereas the median sperm concentration, the progressive motility, and total motile sperm count increased (from 25.0 to 43.0 million/mL, p&lt;0.0001; from 50% to 56%, p=0.022; from 34.8 to 54.6 million, p&lt;0.0001, respectively). Thirty-four patients were oligospermic before the vaccine, and also in these patients we observed a significant increase of sperm parameters after vaccine. Finally, we confirmed the aforementioned results in men who received a mRNA or a viral vector vaccine. The semen parameters following COVID-19 vaccination did not reflect any causative detrimental effect from vaccination, and for the first time we demonstrated that this applies to both mRNA and viral-vector vaccines. The known individual variation in semen and the reduced abstinence time before the post-vaccine sample collection may explain the increases in sperm parameters.","Massarotti, Stigliani, Maccarini, Bovis, Ferraro, Gazzo, Anserini, Scaruffi","https://doi.org/10.5534/wjmh.220055","20220901","COVID-19; Infertility, male; Semen analysis; Vaccines, synthetic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36961,""

"The COVID-19 lockdown promotes changes in sleep habits in the Croatian general population","To investigate the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on sleep habits in the Croatian general population. In this cross-sectional study, 1173 respondents from the general population (809 women) completed a self-report online questionnaire that gathered demographic data and data on sleep habits and mood changes before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. During the lockdown, bedtime (from 23:11Ã‚Â±1:07 to 23:49Ã‚Â±1:32 h, P&lt;0.001) and waketime were delayed (from 6:51Ã‚Â±1:09 to 7:49Ã‚Â±1:40 h, P&lt;0.001).

"Pre-COVID brain functional connectome features prospectively predict emergence of distress symptoms after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic","Persistent psychological distress associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been well documented. This study aimed to identify pre-COVID brain functional connectome that predicts pandemic-related distress symptoms among young adults. Baseline neuroimaging studies and assessment of general distress using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale were performed with 100 healthy individuals prior to wide recognition of the health risks associated with the emergence of COVID-19. They were recontacted for the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist in the period of community-level outbreaks, and for follow-up distress evaluation again 1 year later. We employed the network-based statistic approach to identify connectome that predicted the increase of distress based on 136-region-parcellation with assigned network membership. Predictive performance of connectome features and causal relations were examined by cross-validation and mediation analyses. The connectome features that predicted emergence of distress after COVID contained 70 neural connections. Most within-network connections were located in the default mode network (DMN), and affective network-DMN and dorsal attention network-DMN links largely constituted between-network pairs. The hippocampus emerged as the most critical hub region. Predictive models of the connectome remained robust in cross-validation. Mediation analyses demonstrated that COVID-related posttraumatic stress partially explained the correlation of connectome to the development of general distress. Brain functional connectome may fingerprint individuals with vulnerability to psychological distress associated with the COVID pandemic. Individuals with brain neuromarkers may benefit from the corresponding interventions to reduce the risk or severity of distress related to fear of COVID-related challenges.","Pan, Qin, Yu, Long, Zhang, He, Suo, Zhang, Sweeney, Wang, Gong","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002173","20220901","Brain connectome; COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; fMRI; posttraumatic stress; psychoradiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36966,""
"Positive and negative mood states mediated the effects of psychological resilience on emotional stability among high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study investigated the parallel mediating effects of positive and negative mood states on the relationship between psychological resilience and emotional stability among first- through third-year senior high school students in China during the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 408 questionnaires distributed from April 11 to April 22, 2022, to students at a high school located in Changzhou, Jiangsu, China, 360 were completed correctly and analyzed using a cross-sectional study design. The questionnaire included items from the modified Chinese version of the Psychological Resilience Scale, the Profile of Mood States scale, and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale in Chinese, the latter to assess emotional stability. The mediating effects of mood states on the relationship between psychological resilience and emotional stability were explored by using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping methods. The results indicated that psychological resilience directly affected emotional stability but also indirectly affected emotional stability through the mediating effects of positive and negative mood states. The mediating effect of negative mood states was greater than that of positive mood states. This result differs from that of research conducted prior to the pandemic, which found that compared with the damage caused by negative moods to emotional stability, positive moods more strongly promoted emotional stability. Our findings indicate that high school officials in China should consider strengthening mental health support for students who are taking courses online during home quarantine.","Han, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.967669","20220901","COVID-19 pandemic; emotional stability; high school student; mood state; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36967,""
"Behavior without beliefs: Profiles of heteronormativity and well-being among heterosexual and non-heterosexual university students in Chile","Heteronormativity comprises essentialist, binary beliefs about sex and gender, and normative behaviors derived from those beliefs. There is scarce literature on how heteronormative attitudes and well-being variables are concurrent among individuals who are heterosexual or gay, lesbian, bisexual, and of other queer sexual identities (LGBQ). The objective of this study was to distinguish profiles of university students based on essentialism and normative behavior, two dimensions of heteronormativity, and to characterize these groups by sexual orientation and gender, perceived social support, physical and mental health, and life satisfaction. A sample of 552 university students in Temuco, Chile, responded to an online questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic questions, the Scale of Heteronormative Attitudes and Beliefs, the Life Satisfaction Scale, the Health-Related Quality of Life Index, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. We used Latent profile analysis to distinguish profiles based on significant score differences in Essentialism and Normative behavior. We identified four heteronormativity profiles: <i>High heteronormativity</i> (34.85%), with a significant proportion of heterosexuals and men; <i>Low heteronormativity</i> (25.59%), comprising a significant proportion of students who were non-binary, and LGBQ; <i>Heteronormativity focused on normative behavior</i> (20.42%), with a significant proportion students who were men or non-binary, and who were lesbian, gay or bisexual or preferred not to disclose their sexual orientation; and <i>Heteronormativity focused on essentialism</i> (19.14%), with a significant proportion of heterosexuals and women, and individuals who preferred not to disclose their sexual orientation. The four profiles differed in the proportions of students by faculty and area of residence (urban/rural), and by life satisfaction, self-perceived mental health, and perceived social support. These results show that patterns of association between heteronormativity and subjective well-being are heterogeneous among heterosexual and non-heterosexual individuals. Some of these patterns may respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted daily life and social dynamics. These findings expand our understanding of advantageous and disadvantageous conditions associated with maintaining heteronormativity attitudes, particularly among non-heterosexual individuals.","Orellana, AlarcÃƒÂ³n, Schnettler","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.988054","20220901","Heteronormativity; LGBTQI+; latent profile analysis; subjective well-being; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36968,""
"Acute Adverse Effects of Vaccines Against SARS-COV-2","Introduction The global struggle against the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) on physical and mental health and on economic and social aspects of human life continues even after two and a half years have passed since the emergence of this virus. The development of vaccines was a milestone. By June 2022, billions of people have been vaccinated against the deadly virus. However, like any other vaccine, the various vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also cause a variety of adverse effects. Therefore this study aimed to determine the different acute side effects experienced after receiving the vaccines and correlating them with some socio-demographic and biomedical factors.Ã‚ Methodology This cross-sectional study has a sample size of 467. Study participants were recruited after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria. After gaining approval from the Ethical Review Board (ERB) of CMH Lahore Medical College and Institute of Dentistry, Lahore, Pakistan,Ã‚Â an onlineÃ‚Â questionnaire was distributed via social media. The survey questionnaire had a series of questions regarding the socio-demographic and biomedical characteristics of the participants, as well as the type of vaccine they got, followed by questions about the development of adverse effects after each dose (first and second). Data were statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). The analysis was carried out in a confidence range of 95%, and a p-value&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.Ã‚ Results Sinopharm (76.0%) was the most frequently received vaccine. Adverse events were reported more after the first dose (79.7%) than in the second (67.2%) (p value 0.001). The reported adverse events after either dose were of mild intensity (p&lt;0.05). None of the individuals reported serious adverse events or hospitalization after getting the shots. Females, younger age groups, and individuals with BMI in the underweight category were more prone to developing symptoms and experiencing difficulty doing routine work after getting the doses. The associations were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Blood group (A,B,0,AB), past COVID-19 history, and smoking status were not positively associated with the appearance of symptoms after either dose or with inconvenience doing daily work post-vaccination. Conclusion The vaccines developed against COVID-19 offer benefits that outweigh the few mild adverse effects experienced. None of these symptoms is severe enough to stop an individual from doing routine work or result in morbidity or mortality. Therefore, people should avoid any hesitancy towards getting vaccinated to get past this pandemic.","Mahmood, Shujaat, Hayat, Ijaz, Habib, Sadaqat, Aftab, Inam","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.27379","20220901","adverse side effect; covid-19; sars-cov-2; sinopharm; vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36969,""
"Long-covid cognitive impairment: Cognitive assessment and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping correlation in a Brazilian cohort","Few studies have objectively evaluated cognitive deficits after the acute phase of COVID-19 disease. Moreover, the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes in cognitive decline in patients with COVID-19 has not been evaluated yet. This cross-sectional study was conducted in confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms that persisted for more than 3 months from the onset. We determined APOE genotypes. The final sample consisted of 141 patients. The most frequent APOE genotype was E3/E3 (<i>N</i> = 95; 67.3%). In total, 93 patients (65.9%) had memory impairment symptoms as the main complaint, objectively confirmed through screening tests in 25 patients (17.7%). Patients with cognitive impairment had a lower frequency of anosmia than the normal and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) groups (<i>p</i> = 0.005). In addition, depression was recurrent in the cognitive impairment group and the SCD group (<i>p</i> = 0.046). Cognitive impairment was significantly more frequent in hospitalized patients and those with a lower education level. Cognitive status was not associated with APOE genotypes. Hospitalized patients had more severe infection with a greater possibility of systemic complications, greater inflammatory response, and prolonged hospitalization, which could impact cognitive performance. Cognitive impairment in patients with COVID-19 does not necessarily involve specific APOE polymorphisms. However, psychiatric disorders may also be responsible for cognitive complaints. Cognitive complaints are frequent in patients with COVID-19, even after the acute phase of the disease and in mild cases. Hospitalized participants and depressed patients may have a higher risk of cognitive impairment. APOE genotypes or haplotypes may not significantly play a role in COVID-19 cognitive impairment.","Tavares-JÃƒÂºnior, Oliveira, da Silva, Feitosa, Sousa, Cunha, Gaspar, Gomes, de Oliveira, Moreira-Nunes, Montenegro, Sobreira-Neto, Braga-Neto","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.947583","20220901","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 infection; cognitive impairment; dementia; risk factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36970,""
"Association of social support with negative emotions among Chinese adolescents during Omicron-related lockdown of Shenzhen City: The roles of rumination and sleep quality","Adolescents are likely to suffer from negative emotions such as depression and anxiety due to the rapid development of biological, cognitive and social changes. Previous studies have indicated possible risk (rumination) and protective (good social support and high sleep quality) factors for depression and anxiety among this age group. The present study is the first to investigate the association between social support and negative emotions during the Outbreak of Omicron variant, on this basis, to further determine the mediating role of rumination and sleep quality on this link. A total of 1,065 Chinese middle- and high-school students (51.5% female, <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 13.80, <i>SD</i> = 1.20) completed a psychosocial battery, including the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Serial multiple mediation analysis was conducted using PROCESS macro based on SPSS. Social support, rumination, and sleep quality were significantly negatively correlated with negative emotional states (Ps &lt; 0.05). Further, rumination and sleep quality were found to partially mediate the relationship between social support and negative emotional states. For early detection and prevention of depression and anxiety, providing sufficient social support is necessary for adolescents, because rumination and sleep problems are reported during stressful periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Zhang, Taylor, Hall, Yeung, Kramer, Zou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.957382","20220901","anxiety; depression; rumination; sleep quality; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36971,""
"How mindful self-care practices changed during the winter 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Western Sydney","Self-care strategies are important to maintain psychological wellbeing. The aim of this study was toÃ‚Â explore how self-care changed during the first COVID-19 lockdown in winter 2020 and identify targetsÃ‚Â for interventions. This was a cross-sectional study. Participants attendingÃ‚Â a COVID-19 testing clinic completed theÃ‚Â Mindful Self-Care Scale (MSCS) and Hospital AnxietyÃ‚Â and Depression Scale (HADS). A total of 332 participants completed questionnaires (mean age 38 years, 55% female). Self-care strategies used less frequently during lockdown when compared with pre-lockdown were in MSCS domains of Physical Care (PÃ‚Â &lt;0.001), Supportive Relationships (PÃ‚Â &lt;0.001), Supportive Structures (PÃ‚Â &lt;0.001) and Mindful Awareness (PÃ‚Â &lt;0.001). Mean anxiety and depression scores were 5.97 (standard deviation [SD]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.36) and 4.12 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.594). Several pre-pandemic strategies were used less frequently, including individual activities not restricted during lockdown ('listening'; 'using images' to relax). This study provides insight into activities that are practised and reduced during a lockdown, which can guide wellbeing interventions to assist people in isolation.","Bakhshi, Brennan, Verdonk, Vukasovic, Coggins","https://doi.org/10.31128/AJGP-10-21-6223","20220901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36972,""

"The public health impact of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic","Social distancing measures have been effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19; however, they have imposed a significant burden on population mental health and well-being. This study aimed to identify factors associated with loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to describe the relationship between loneliness and the risk of worsening health outcomes and behaviours. Data for 8,960 adults were drawn from a national cross-sectional survey undertaken in Wales between January and June 2021. Participants self-reported changes to health and behaviour since the start of the pandemic. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with loneliness, and the impact of loneliness on self-reported changes in physical health, physical fitness, mental health, weight, alcohol consumption and social relations in comparison with pre-pandemic experiences. Groups most at risk of loneliness were those agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°35Ã‚Â years, women (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.86 [1.70-2.05]), those with chronic health conditions (1.43 [1.29-1.58]) and the unemployed (2.18 [1.76-2.70]). Loneliness was a strong predictor of worsening health outcomes and behaviours, with those reporting often feeling lonely being at increased odds of worsening physical health (3.29 [2.80-3.86]), physical fitness (2.22 [1.90-2.60]), mental health (8.33 [6.95-9.99]), weight (1.39 [1.19-1.62]), alcohol consumption (1.37 [1.12,-1.66]) and social relations (2.45 [2.07-2.89]) during the pandemic. This study established an association between loneliness and self-reported worsening health during the pandemic, and identified factors increasing the risk of loneliness. The effect that social control measures have on loneliness should influence the design of future public health policy.","Allen, Darlington, Hughes, Bellis","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14055-2","20220831","COVID-19; Loneliness; Mental health; Physical health; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36974,""
"A 6-month longitudinal study on worsening of Parkinson's disease during the COVID-19 pandemic","Further studies are required to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Parkinson's disease (PD) progression. This study investigated the motor and non-motor progression of people with PD (PWP) at 6 months during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with that during the pre-pandemic period. Patients were recruited from Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo, in the period between April 2019 and December 2020. Fifty patients were included, of whom 17 and 33 patients were followed for 6 months before and during the pandemic, respectively. All patients were assessed at baseline and at 6 months using the MDS-UPDRS, Schwab and England scale (S&amp;E), Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&amp;Y), Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test (TUG), International Physical Activity Questionnaire, New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Both groups were matched in age, gender, and disease characteristics. Patients followed during the pandemic showed more significant worsening of the total, part I and motor part of MDS-UPDRS, and balance scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) than those followed during the pre-COVID-19 period. Gait (TUG), balance, and physical activity worsening were significantly correlated with baseline BDI, gait and balance scores, total and part I MDS-UPDRS scores, H&amp;Y, and S&amp;E OFF scores. Gait deterioration (TUG) was correlated with baseline physical activity (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.510, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). PWP showed worsening of motor and non-motor symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic at the 6-month follow-up. Worsening of gait, balance, and physical activity was correlated with baseline motor and physical activity OFF scores.","Shalash, Helmy, Salama, Gaber, El-Belkimy, Hamid","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-022-00376-x","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36975,""
"Mapping the Timescale of Suicidal Thinking","Suicide is one of the most devastating aspects of human nature and has puzzled scholars for thousands of years. Most suicide research to date has focused on establishing the prevalence and predictors of the presence or severity of suicidal thoughts/behaviors. Surprisingly little research has documented the fundamental properties of suicidal thoughts/behaviors, such as: when someone has a suicidal thought, how long do such thoughts last? Documenting the basic properties of a phenomenon is necessary to understand, study, and treat it. This study aims to identify the timescale of suicidal thinking, leveraging novel real-time monitoring data and a number of different novel analytic approaches. Participants were 105 adults with past week suicidal thoughts who completed a 42-day real-time monitoring study (total number of observations=20,255). Participants completed two forms of real time assessments: traditional real-time assessments (spaced hours apart each day) and high-frequency assessments (spaced 10 minutes apart over one hour). We found that suicidal thinking changes rapidly. Both descriptive statistics and Markov-Switching models indicated that that elevated states of suicidal thinking lasted on average 1 to 3 hours. Individuals exhibited considerable heterogeneity in how often and for how long they reported elevated suicidal thinking, and our analyses suggest that different aspects of suicidal thinking operated on different timescales. Continuous-time autoregressive models suggest that current suicidal intent is predictive of future intent levels for 2 to 3 hours, while current suicidal desire predictive of future suicidal desire levels for 20 hours. Multiple models found that elevated suicidal intent has on average shorter duration than elevated suicidal desire. Finally, our ability to capture within-person dynamics of suicidal thinking was improved using high-frequency sampling. For example, traditional real-time assessments alone estimated the duration of severe suicidal states of suicidal desire as 9.5 hours, whereas, the high-frequency assessments shifted the estimated duration to 1.4 hours. The high-frequency assessments identified 19% more participants with a high-risk response than the traditional real-time assessment, and high frequency measurements were shown to capture considerable levels of variation across consecutive measurement occasions. These results provide the most detailed characterization to date of the temporal dynamics of suicidal thinking. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of sampling frequency in capturing the dynamics of a phenomenon.","Daniel D.L.

"Using Managers' Expectations for Ex-ante Policy Evaluation: Evidence from the COVID-19 Crisis","Evaluation of the impacts of government policies during an economic crisis is often delayed until the outcomes are realized. Policies can be better guided if they can be evaluated amid a crisis, before the realization of outcomes. This study examines whether survey data on the expectations of small business managers can help evaluate two high-stake subsidies for <U+FB01>rms amid the COVID-19 crisis in Japan, namely, Subsidy Program for Sustaining Businesses (SPSB) and Employment Adjustment Subsidy (EAS). We evaluate the accuracy of managersâ€™ expectations, estimate the impact of subsidies on the expected <U+FB01>rm survival, and compare it with the estimated impact on realized survival. We <U+FB01>nd that the managersâ€™ expectations on their future sales, survival rate, and the possibility of receiving these subsidies predict the realized outcomes, although they were highly pessimistic about their survival rates. We <U+FB01>nd that the estimated impacts of the SPSB on the expected survival rates have the same sign as the estimated impact on the realized survival rates, but the size is more than twice because of the pessimism on survival. The estimated impacts of the EAS are both insigni<U+FB01>cant. Therefore, although its impact may be overestimated, managersâ€™ expectations are useful for selecting an e<U+FB00>ective policy.","Kohei Kawaguchi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00F7-4B3-576","20220902","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; subsidies; firm forecast; covid-19; small business; policy evaluation","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","",36977,""
