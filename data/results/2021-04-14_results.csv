"Impact of COVID -19 on Depression and Anxiety among Healthcare Professionals in Abu Dhabi","The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of healthcare Professionals (HCP), who have served at an increased risk of psychological distress, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted between April 11th, and July 23rd, 2020, to assess depression and anxiety of healthcare workers, during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online, self-administered, anonymous questionnaire evaluated 1,268 HCP. More than half of the participants reported symptoms of anxiety (51.5%), while almost half (48.48 %) presented with minimal anxiety. Mild anxiety was reported in 28.8% of participating HCWs, and 12.68 % of the participants registered moderate anxiety scores, while 9.95 % reported severe anxiety. Depression symptoms were revealed in 37.79 % of participating providers, though most participants (60.3%), scored in the minimal depression category. Among all participates, 4.3 % and 2.7 % reported moderately severe and severe depression, accordingly, while 22.5%, and 8.8 % of the participating health care providers documented mild and moderate depression. The high prevalence of anxiety and depression recorded among HCP during the pandemic suggests that mental health intervention and support are necessary to ensure the psychological well-being of HCP","Amal Alzarooni; Aljazia Alghfeli; Hamda Alremeithi; Roqayah Al Madhaani,; Latifa Al Ketbi,","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.11.21253563","20210413","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12874,""
"Long COVID In Adults at 12 Months After Mild-to-Moderate SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Background. In a proportion of patients recovered from the acute COVID-19 phase, a variable range of symptoms has been observed to persist for at least 6-months. Objectives. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-related symptoms 12-months after the onset of mild-to-moderate disease. Methods Prospective study based on structured questionnaires and additional outcomes. Results 304/354 patients completing the survey at baseline also completed the follow-up interview (85.9%; median [range] age, 47 [18-76] years; 185 [60.9%] women). Persistence of at least one symptom at 12-months follow-up was reported by 161 patients (53.0%). The most commonly reported symptom of long COVID was felt tired (n=83, 27.3%), followed by smell or taste impairment (n=67, 22.0%), shortness of breath (n=39, 12.8%) and muscle pain (n=28, 9.2%). Being females (OR=1.64; 95% CI: 1.00-2.70), aged between 40-54 (OR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.07-3.44), having a BMI[ge]25 (OR=1.67; 95% CI: 1.00-2.78), and experiencing more symptoms during the acute phase of the disease (OR=8.71 for [ge]8 symptoms; 95% CI: 2.73-27.76) were associated with long COVID. Persistence of symptoms showed a significant impact on quality of life (p[lt];0.0001) and depression scale scores (p=0.0102). Conclusion More than half of patients with previous mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 complained the persistence of at least one symptom 12-months after the onset of the illness.","Paolo Boscolo Rizzo; Francesco Guida; Jerry Polesel; Alberto Vito Marcuzzo; Vincenzo Capriotti; Andrea D'Alessandro; Enrico Zanelli; Riccardo Marzolino; Chiara Lazzarin; Paolo Antonucci; Erica Sacchet; Margherita Tofanelli; Daniele Borsetto; Nicoletta Gardenal; Martino Pengo; Giancarlo Tirelli","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.12.21255343","20210413","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12875,""
"Depression and anxiety among the University community during the Covid-19 pandemic: a study in Southern Brazil","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted people routine in several ways, including the temporary cessation of face-to-face teaching activities, which may affect the mental health of the population. This study aimed to assess the mental health of the academic community of a University in South Brazil during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional web-based survey conducted between July-August 2020 through a self-administered online questionnaire. All University staff and students were eligible. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and anxiety by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. All analyses were stratified by academic or administrative staff, undergraduate and graduate students. Results: 2,785 individuals participated in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety were 39.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 37.3-41.1) and 52.5% (95% CI 50.6-54.4), respectively. On stratified analyses, undergraduate students showed a higher prevalence of the outcomes compared to other groups. In relation to social distancing, higher prevalence of mental illness was associated to strictly following the guidelines of authority and with not leaving the house routinely, but these associations were restricted to some subgroups. Mental health care and previous diagnosis of mental illness were associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression. Limitations: The main concerns were the representativeness of the sample and the response rate. Conclusions: An alarming prevalence of mental illness was observed in this academic community. Despite the well-known benefits of social distancing and quarantine to public health, it requires a special surveillance on the mental health of the population, especially students and those with previous mental illness diagnosis.","Helena Silveira Schuch; Mariana Gonzalez Cademartori; Valesca Doro Dias; Mateus Luz Levandowski; Tiago Neunenfeld Munhoz; Pedro Curi Hallal; Flavio Fernando Demarco","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.12.21255340","20210413","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12876,""
"COVID-19 and mortality risk in patients with psychiatric disorders","COVID-19 has already caused the deaths of over 2.5 million people worldwide. Patients with certain medical conditions and severe psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of dying from it. However, such people have a reduced life expectancy anyway, raising the question whether COVID-19 incurs a specific risk for such patients for dying, over and above the risk of dying from other causes. We analysed the UK Biobank data of half a million middle-aged participants from the UK. From the start of 2020 up to 24th January 2021, 894 participants had died from COVID-19 and another 4,562 had died from other causes. We demonstrate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 among patients with mental health problems, especially those with dementia, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, is increased compared to the risk of dying from other causes. This increase among patients with severe psychiatric disorders cannot be explained solely by the higher rate of diabetes or cardiovascular disorders.","George Kirov; Emily Baker","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.08.21255046","20210413","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12877,""
"Innovative Virtual Role-Play Simulations for Managing Substance Use Conversations: Pilot Study Results and Relevance During and After COVID-19","Substance use places a significant burden on our communities, both economically and socially. In light of COVID-19, it is predicted that as many as 75,000 more people will die from alcohol and other substance use, and suicide as a result of isolation, new mental health concerns, and various other stressors related to the pandemic. Public awareness campaigns that aim to destigmatize substance use and help individuals have meaningful conversations with friends, coworkers, or family members to address substance use concerns are a timely and cost-effective means of augmenting existing behavioral health efforts related to substance use. These types of interventions can supplement the work being done by existing public health initiatives. This pilot study examines the impact of the One Degree: Shift the Influence role-play simulation, designed to teach family, friends, and coworkers to effectively manage problem-solving conversations with individuals that they are concerned about regarding substance use. Participants recruited for this mixed methods study completed a pre-survey, the simulation, a post survey, and were sent a six-week follow-up survey. The simulation involves practicing a role-play conversation with a virtual human coded with emotions, memory and personality. A virtual coach provides feedback in using evidence-based communication strategies such as motivational interviewing. Matched sample ANOVA revealed significant increases at follow-up in composite attitudinal constructs of preparedness (P&lt;.001) and self-efficacy (P=.012), including: 1) starting a conversation with someone regarding substance use, 2) avoiding upsetting someone while bringing up concerns, 3) focusing on observable facts, and 4) problem-solving. Qualitative data provided further evidence of the simulation's positive impact on ability to have meaningful conversations about substance use. This study provides preliminary evidence that conversation-based simulations like One Degree: Shift the Influence, that utilize role-play practice, can teach individuals to use evidence-based communication strategies and can cost-effectively reach geographically dispersed populations to support public health initiatives for primary prevention.","Albright, Khalid, Shockley, Robinson, Hughes, Pace-Danley","https://doi.org/10.2196/27164","20210413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12878,""
"Protocol for The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study: A longitudinal cohort study of mental health among pregnant Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and developmental outcomes in their children","The COVID-19 pandemic and countermeasures implemented by governments around the world have led to dramatically increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures, because they represent a demographic that is most affected by disasters and because pregnancy itself entails significant life changes that require major psychosocial and emotional adjustments. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, and developmental outcomes in their offspring. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals and developmental outcomes in their offspring. Findings of the study are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and their offspring and point toward prevention and intervention targets. The PdP study comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Participants were eligible if they were: pregnant, Ã¢â€°Â¥17 years, Ã¢â€°Â¤35 weeks gestation at study enrollment, living in Canada, and able to read and write in English or French. At enrollment, participants completed an initial survey that assessed demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, previous pregnancies and births, pre-pregnancy health, health conditions during pregnancy, medications, psychological distress, social support, and hardships experienced because of COVID-19 (e.g., lost employment, loved one dying). For the first three months following the initial survey, participants received a monthly email link to complete a follow-up survey that asked about experiences since the previous survey. After three months, follow-up surveys were sent every other month to reduce participant burden. For each of these surveys, participants were first asked if they were still pregnant and then routed either to the next prenatal survey or to the delivery survey. In the postpartum, surveys were sent at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of infant age to assess maternal stress, psychological distress and infant development. Participant recruitment via social media (Facebook, Instagram) began on April 5, 2020 and is ongoing. As of October 2019, more than 8200 individuals completed the initial survey. Follow-up data collection is ongoing. This longitudinal investigation seeks to elucidate the associations between hardships, maternal psychological distress, child development during COVID-19, and risk and resilience factors that amplify or ameliorate these associations. Findings are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and point toward prevention and intervention targets.

"A survey of the contribution made by UK orchestras to the health and well-being sectors","To provide a comprehensive picture of the contribution that orchestras currently make in the public health sector. An online survey of member orchestras of the Association of British Orchestras. Data gathered covered geographical, financial and musical aspects, the type of healthcare settings in which the work takes place, orchestras' motivation for their involvement in the healthcare sector, the role health and well-being delivery plays in their business models, and finally, the impact of COVID-19 on orchestras' current and future plans. Approximately half of UK orchestras are engaged significantly in the area of health and well-being in all four UK nations and a wide range of healthcare settings. There is a strong appetite to develop this work among those orchestras not yet involved. At the same time, the extent of this work is not formally recognised or paid for by the healthcare sector. While there is considerable unevenness in the provision, it is clear that UK professional orchestras made a significant contribution to the health and well-being sectors in hospitals and other healthcare settings. There is scope for a greater contribution by orchestras to the healthcare sector, which will require more formal recognition of the value of this work.","Derbyshire, Harvey, Swann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.01.030","20210413","COVID-19; Care settings; Hospitals; Mental health; Social care settings; Social prescribing; UK orchestras","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12880,""
"Cross-sectional analysis of vaccine intention, perceptions and hesitancy across Latin America and the Caribbean","Determinants of vaccine acceptance are multifactorial, complex, and in most cases, context-dependent. We determined the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination intention (VI) and fear of its adverse effects (FAE) as well as their associated factors in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We conducted a secondary cross-sectional analysis of a database collected by the University of Maryland and Facebook. We included participants aged 18 and over from LAC surveyed, January 15 to February 1, 2021. We evaluated VI, FAE, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptomatology, compliance with community mitigation strategies, food and economic insecurity, mental health evaluation and the influence in VI when recommended by different stakeholders. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95%CIs. We analyzed 472,521 responses by Latin American adults, finding a VI and FAE prevalence of 80.0% and 81.2%, respectively. We found that female and non-binary genders were associated with a lower probability of VI and a higher probability of FAE. Besides, living in a town, village or rural area and economic insecurity was associated with a higher FAE probability. The fears of becoming seriously ill, a family member becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and having depressive symptoms were associated with a higher probability of VI and FAE. Eight out of 10 adults in LAC have VI and FEA. The factors identified are useful for the development of communication strategies to reduce FAE frequency. It is necessary to guarantee mass vaccination and support the return of economic activities.","Urrunaga-Pastor, Bendezu-Quispe, Herrera-AÃƒÂ±azco, Uyen-Cateriano, Toro-Huamanchumo, Rodriguez-Morales, Hernandez, Benites-Zapata","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.102059","20210413","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Latin America; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccination Refusal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12881,""
"Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Anxiety Depression And Intention To Go To Hospital in Chronic Patients","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety depression and intention to go to hospital in chronic patients. The Bostan Intention to Go to Hospital Scale developed by one researcher (SB) as the data collection tool and the Beck Anxiety-Depression Inventories were used. 56.8% of the patients stated that they would go to the hospital in case of emergency and 28.3% expressed that they did not want to go to the hospital even in this case. 50% of the patients said that they did not want to go to the hospital under any circumstances during the pandemic process. As a result of the correlation analysis, there were inverse correlation between the anxiety-depression levels and encountering COVID patient and having a relative with COVID(p=0.001). Inverse correlation was found between intention to go to hospital and encountering COVID patient(p=0.001). It was revealed that chronic patients did not have any intentions to go to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemia and only half of people were willing to go to hospital in case of emergency.

"#winemom and #momjuice posts on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional, descriptive study","The tendency of parents to consume alcohol during the COVID-19. pandemic is likely to be moderated by pandemic related stress combined with the ongoing demands of childcare and home-based education, which are reported to be more burdensome for females than males. The purpose of this study was to describe alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using two popular hashtags, #momjuice and #winemom on Instagram, 50 posts on each were garnered from the &quot;top posts&quot; tab. The coding categories were created inductively and were as follows: displays alcohol (drinking/holding alcohol or alcohol itself); person is making alcoholic beverages; type of alcohol featured or discussed; highlights anxiety and/or depression/mental state; highlights struggling (in general); highlights parenting challenges; encourages alcohol consumption; discourages alcohol consumption; features a person wearing clothing or show products promoting alcohol; promotes alcohol rehabilitation; highlights caffeine to alcohol daily transition throughout the day; and highlights other drugs aside of caffeine and alcohol. Overall, the 100 videos had a total of 5,108 comments and 94,671 likes. The respective averages (standard deviations) were 51.08 (77.94) and 946.71 (1731.72). A majority of the videos (58%) featured a woman, while only 5% featured a male. The remaining videos featured a non-binary individual (10%), both a male and female (6%), or this was not applicable (21%). A majority (&gt;50%) of videos reviewed encouraged alcohol consumption (66%) and/or displayed alcohol (56%). Of the 66 that encouraged and/or displayed alcohol, the overwhelming type of alcohol discussed or featured was wine (55%). Only 6% of the videos reviewed discouraged alcohol use and only 4% provided the audience with a disclaimer. None of the videos observed promoted/endorsed alcohol rehabilitation in any way. Only 37% of the videos reviewed highlighted struggle. However, these videos garnered more than a majority of the likes (52.3%). Videos that showed struggle received an average of 1,359.57 (SD=2,108.02) likes. Those that did not show struggle had an average of 704.24 (SD=1,447.46) likes. An independent one-tailed t-test demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant, as well, with p=.04991. The findings of this investigation suggest that though these hashtags ostensibly exist to valorize excess alcohol consumption, they may be serving as a support system for mothers who are experiencing increased burdens and role stress during the pandemic. Given the strains placed on mothers overall and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts must be taken to increase access to and affordability of telehealth-based mental health care.","Basch, Meleo-Erwin, Mohlman, Fera, Quinones","https://doi.org/10.2196/28991","20210413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12883,""

"Impact of Big Data Analytics on People's Health: Overview of Systematic Reviews and Recommendations for Future Studies","Although the potential of big data analytics for health care is well recognized, evidence is lacking on its effects on public health. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the use of big data analytics on people's health based on the health indicators and core priorities in the World Health Organization (WHO) General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), approved and adopted by its Member States, in addition to SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Furthermore, we sought to identify the most relevant challenges and opportunities of these tools with respect to people's health. Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Epistemonikos) were searched from the inception date to September 21, 2020. Systematic reviews assessing the effects of big data analytics on health indicators were included. Two authors independently performed screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) checklist. The literature search initially yielded 185 records, 35 of which met the inclusion criteria, involving more than 5,000,000 patients. Most of the included studies used patient data collected from electronic health records, hospital information systems, private patient databases, and imaging datasets, and involved the use of big data analytics for noncommunicable diseases. &quot;Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease&quot; and &quot;suicide mortality rate&quot; were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025.

"Are individuals with orofacial pain more prone to psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic?","It is of utmost importance to identify and treat groups susceptible to psychological problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to compare the psychological status between the general population and subjects with orofacial pain (OFP) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 509 young adults were recruited based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, using the convenient sampling approach. They were assigned to 2 study groups: group 1 - individuals with OFP; and group 2 - the general population. Their background variables, knowledge, perception, attitude, concerns, and Kessler scale scores were recorded through an online questionnaire. Student's t test, the Ãâ€¡2 test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for the statistical analysis. Some of the background variables were significantly different between the study groups (p &lt; 0.05). The knowledge, perception and attitude scores of the respondents were not significantly different between the study groups (p &gt; 0.05). Females exhibited significantly higher adjusted Kessler scores as compared to males (p &lt; 0.05). Group 1 exhibited the highest adjusted Kessler scores (p &lt; 0.05). Individuals with OFP exhibited higher psychological distress, depressive symptoms and anxiety during the rapid rise of the COVID-19 outbreak, representing a moderate psychological disorder. Females suffered more from psychological distress as compared to males. Therefore, psychological interventions should be focused on this group.","Saki, Shadmanpour, Najafi","https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/131683","20210413","COVID-19; Kessler scale (K10); orofacial pain; psychological status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12887,""
"Family Caregiving During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted persons with existing chronic health conditions. The pandemic also has the potential to exacerbate stresses of family caregiving. We compare family caregivers with non-caregivers on physical, psychosocial, and financial well-being outcomes during the pandemic and determine family caregivers most at risk for adverse outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 576 family caregivers and 2,933 non-caregivers from April-May 2020 in Pittsburgh, PA region with a national supplement. Outcome measures included concurrent anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social participation; and financial well-being); and perceived changes due to COVID-19 (loneliness, financial well-being, food security). We also measured socio-demographic; caregiving contextual variables; and COVID-related caregiver stressors (COVID Caregiver Risk Index). Controlling for socio-demographics, family caregivers reported higher anxiety; depression; fatigue; sleep disturbance; lower social participation; lower financial well-being; increased food insecurity (all p &lt; .01) and increased financial worries (p=.01). Caregivers who reported more COVID-related caregiver stressors and disruptions reported more adverse outcomes (all p &lt; .01). In addition, caregivers who were female, younger, lower income, providing both personal / medical care, and providing care for cognitive / behavioral / emotional problems reported more adverse outcomes. Challenges of caregiving are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Family caregivers reported increased duties, burdens, and resulting adverse health, psychosocial, and financial outcomes. Results were generally consistent with caregiver stress-health process models. Family caregivers should receive increased support during this serious public health crisis.","Beach, Schulz, Donovan, Rosland","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab049","20210413","Caregiver stress; Informal caregiving; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12888,""
"School Nursing in a Pandemic: Striving for Excellence in Santa Fe Public Schools","When the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic led to school closures around the nation in March 2020, the role of the school nurse changed significantly, and it has continued to evolve as districts grapple with how to safely meet students' academic needs while also protecting the health of their communities. Nurses working for Santa Fe Public Schools in New Mexico have taken their new roles seriously and have been working closely with their district leaders, the New Mexico Department of Health, School Health Advocates, and the Public Education Department to facilitate evidence-based policies and procedures. Activities have included cohorting, contact tracing, resource development, education (of staff and families), planning and implementation of safety procedures, coordination of surveillance testing, and staff screening, along with finding new, COVID safe ways to provide standard school nursing services, including immunization administration, hearing and vision screening, teaching, and promoting wellness and mental health.","Barbee-Lee, Seymour, Hett, Norris, Stack, Cartier, Haycox, Armstrong, Herbert","https://doi.org/10.1177/1942602X211005166","20210413","COVID-19; hybrid education; public health; school nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12889,""
"Keeping COVID out: a collaborative approach to COVID-19 is associated with a significant reduction in self-harm in young people in custody","To describe the collaboration between Youth Justice New South Wales (YJNSW) and Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (JHFMHN) during the early COVID-19 Response (CR) across the six Youth Justice centres in NSW, and the reduced incidence of self-harm noted over this period. Narrative article with analysis of self-harm incident data during the initial CR period of March to May 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. During the initial CR period (March to May 2020), there was a highly significant, four-fold reduction in self-harming incidents recorded by both YJNSW and JHFMHN compared with the equivalent time period in 2019 (<i>p</i> &lt; .00001). The greater than four-fold reduction in self-harm by young people during the early CR may relate to the 'interagency response', with an increase in positive interactions between staff, and between staff and young people. The reduction in self-harm and improvements in mental health will be further explored through standardised interviews with the young people and staff.","Kasinathan, Haysom, Andriotis, Wheaton, Lloyd, Langstaff, McClelland, Whiting, Southgate, Vita, McGrath, Palmai, Armstrong, O'Donovan, Oyan, Woodward, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211006125","20210413","COVID-19; adolescent; custody; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12890,""
"School teachers: the forgotten frontline workers of Covid-19","Australian school teachers have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Teachers have had to face relentless and challenging working conditions, take on new roles and responsibilities, and embrace new ways of working. We searched reports and the available research literature on teacher mental health between September 2020 and October 2020. In our perspective piece, we summarise this literature and draw attention to the struggles of Australian school teachers and how Covid-19 has impacted their mental health. To date, there has been a lack of research focusing on teacher mental health both internationally and in Australia. That which is available indicates that teacher mental health is likely to have deteriorated substantially during the pandemic.

"Implementing Skills for Psychological Recovery at a Psychology Training Clinic During COVID-19","The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted the routine provision of community mental health services, which is especially concerning given that emerging data suggest a rise in mental health concerns related to the COVID-19 crisis (Xiong et al., 2020). Thus, it seems imperative to provide trauma-informed services that are tailored to clients' coping with the pandemic and can be effectively delivered via telehealth. The goals of these important services would be to mitigate current distress, help prevent the onset of long-term mental health problems, and facilitate client safety during a public health crisis. The present article provides an overview of adoption and telehealth implementation of the Skills for Psychological Recovery (SPR) secondary prevention program within a psychology training clinic. Initial clinical outcome data supported the program's success in reducing mental health symptoms among individuals in psychological distress due to the COVID-19 crisis; however, the results were more striking for adults than for youths. The article concludes with recommendations for broader implementation and future directions for clinicians, supervisors, organizations, and researchers.","Sheerin, Tugendrajch, Presser, Bell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.03.001","20210413","COVID-19; disaster mental health; skills for psychological recovery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12892,""
"Human ACE2 receptor polymorphisms and altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The viral spike (S) protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade host cells with ~10-15-fold higher affinity compared to SARS-CoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. Here, we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms can alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting this interaction. We analyzed over 290,000 samples representing &gt;400 population groups from public genomic datasets and identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants. Using reported structural data, we identified natural ACE2 variants that could potentially affect virus-host interaction and thereby alter host susceptibility. These include variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R that were predicted to increase susceptibility, while variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y were predicted to be protective variants that show decreased binding to S-protein. Using biochemical assays, we confirmed that K31R and E37K had decreased affinity, and K26R and T92I variants showed increased affinity for S-protein when compared to wildtype ACE2. Consistent with this, soluble ACE2 K26R and T92I were more effective in blocking entry of S-protein pseudotyped virus suggesting that ACE2 variants can modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","Suryamohan, Diwanji, Stawiski, Gupta, Miersch, Liu, Chen, Jiang, Fellouse, Sathirapongsasuti, Albers, Deepak, Saberianfar, Ratan, Washburn, Mis, Santhosh, Somasekar, Hiranjith, Vargas, Mohan, Phalke, Kuriakose, Antony, Ustav, Schuster, Sidhu, Junutula, Jura, Seshagiri","https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02030-3","20210413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12893,""
"Prevalence of mental health problems and associated factors among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: an effort-reward imbalance model-informed study","Poor mental health status and associated risk factors of public health workers have been overlooked during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used the effort-reward imbalance model to investigate the association between work-stress characteristics (effort, over-commitment, reward) and mental health problems (anxiety and depression) among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A total of 4850 valid online questionnaires were collected through a self- constructed sociodemographic questionnaire, the adapted ERI questionnaire, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between ERI factors and mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety), with reward treated as a potential moderator in such associations. The data showed that effort and over-commitment were positively associated with depression and anxiety, while reward was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Development and job acceptance were the two dimensions of reward buffered the harmful effect of effort/over-commitment on depression and anxiety, whereas esteem was non-significant. This study confirmed the harmful effects of effort and over-commitment on mental health among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Such effects could be alleviated through an appropriate reward system, especially the development and job acceptance dimensions of such a system. These findings highlight the importance of establishing an emergency reward system, comprising reasonable work-allocation mechanism, bonuses and honorary titles, a continuous education system and better career-development opportunities.","Zhang, Wang, Xu, You, Li, Liang, Li, Ma, Lau, Hao, Chen, Zeng, Li, Gu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00563-0","20210413","Anxiety; Depression; EffortÃ¢â‚¬â€œreward imbalance; Public health worker; Reward","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12894,""
"Black American Fathers Employed in Higher-Risk Contexts for Contracting COVID-19: Implications for Individual Wellbeing and Work-Family Spillover","Black Americans remain disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging data suggests that employment in certain occupations (e.g., essential; frontline) may place individuals at higher-risk for contracting COVID-19. The current investigation examined how Black American fathers' COVID-19 perceived work risk was associated with their individual well-being (COVID-19 diagnosis; depressive and anxiety symptoms; sleep disturbance; sleep quality) as well as spillover into family contexts. Participants were 466 Black American fathers (<i>M</i> = 36.63; <i>SD</i> = 11.00) who completed online surveys in June-July 2020. Adjusted binomial logistic and multiple regressions were estimated to examine how fathers' work context was associated with COVID-19 health outcomes, psychological functioning, sleep health, and family stress. Descriptive analyses revealed that 32% of fathers reported a personal diagnosis of COVID-19 and 21% indicated that an immediate family member had been diagnosed. Adjusted binomial logistic regression analyses revealed that fathers working in higher-risk contexts for contracting COVID-19 had a greater odds ratio for both a personal (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.68) and an immediate family member diagnosis (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.52, 4.36). Working in a higher-risk context for contracting COVID-19 was associated with poorer psychological functioning, greater sleep disturbance, and higher levels of family discord. Findings suggest that Black fathers working in higher risk contexts may be at risk for COVID-19 exposure and infection. Further, this study indicates that these effects extend to their own well-being, including mental and sleep health as well as increased family stress.","Cooper, Thomas, Bamishigbin","https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883211005617","20210413","behavioral research; family functioning; fathering; menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health; parenting; psychosocial and cultural issues; research; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12895,""

Frontline healthcare workers with increased exposure to COVID diagnosis, treatment and care were especially likely to report psychological burden, fear, anxiety and depression. To elicit how working as a health professional during the pandemic is impacting on the psychological wellbeing of frontline staff. United Kingdom population of healthcare workers were approached by advertising the survey via social media, NHS trusts and other organisations. Open-ended survey answers were qualitatively explored using content analysis. Survey collected data from 395 NHS staff was developed into three themes; (1) Despair and uncertainty: feeling overwhelmed trying to protect everyone, (2) Behavioural and psychological impact: affecting wellbeing and functioning and (3) Coping and employer support: getting the right help. NHS staff felt enormous burden to adequately complete their professional, personal and civil responsibility to keep everyone safe leading to negative psychological and behavioural consequences and desire for NHS employers to offer better support. As the pandemic progresses, the results of this study may inform NHS employers on how optimum support can be offered to help them cope with negative psychological consequences of the pandemic.","Newman, Jeve, Majumder","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211006153","20210413","COVID19; Frontline workers; coronavirus; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12896,""

"Economic stressors and mental health symptoms among Bangladeshi rehabilitation professionals: A cross-sectional study amid COVID-19 pandemic","Background Mental health symptoms are considered a public health concern by many professionals and are frequently impacted by factors related to occupation, employment opportunities, and economic stressors. This study investigated the relationship between economic stressors and mental health symptoms among Bangladeshi rehabilitation professionals. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 420 rehabilitation professionals between July 2020 and October 2020. Economic stressors were measured using Economic Hardship Questionnaire, Financial Threat Scale, and Financial Well-Being Scale. Mental health symptoms were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to find associated factors on mental health problems after adjusting confounders. Results Among 420 rehabilitation professionals 62.1% were male, 38.6% were post-graduated and 75% were in practice. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 51.0%, 58.6%, and 33.6%, respectively. The multivariable regression analysis indicated that without a high professional degree, lack of opportunity to practice, and loss of income were the associated factors for mental health symptoms. The modelling of the structural equation showed that financial threat is significantly associated with mental health symptoms. Conclusion During the era of COVID-19, a high prevalence of mental health symptoms was observed among rehabilitation professionals. To minimize the burden of mental health, we recommend that all rehabilitation organizations and the government come together to create equal opportunities to practice and enable individuals to obtain high professional degrees.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06715","20210401","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12898,""
"Sensory-Processing Sensitivity and COVID-19 Stress in Adolescents: The Mediating Role of Resilience","Psychologists worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the negative impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on adolescentsâ€™ mental health. However, compared to studies involving adults, research on adolescents is limited. To further understand adolescentsâ€™ mental health during the pandemic, the present study examined whether resilience, as a protective factor, buffers the relationship between the personality trait of environmental sensitivity and COVID-19-related distress. A total of 141 adolescents (53.7% women, Mage = 18.91 years, SDage = 0.82 years) living in urban Japan completed an online cross-sectional survey in October 2020. The results showed that sensitivity was positively, though weakly, correlated with COVID-19 stress and negatively correlated with resilience. Resilience was negatively correlated with COVID-19 stress. Mediation analysis showed that resilience buffered the negative relationship between sensitivity and COVID-19 stress, and its indirect effect was statistically significant, albeit close to zero. These results suggest that higher sensitivity is not necessarily a vulnerability factor, if resilience can be enhanced.","Shuhei Iimura","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46025-CD7-57C","20210414","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; covid-19; sensory-processing sensitivity; stress; resilience; environmental sensitivity","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-14","",12899,""
