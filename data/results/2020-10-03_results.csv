"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on ICU Caregivers","Just as every pandemic, COVID-19 could lead to emotional and psychological disturbances among caregivers, especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where significant stress related to the influx of patients, exposure to the virus and the lack of documentation on this new SARS occurred. The present study aimed at assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the caregivers at the peak of the &quot;crisis period&quot;. A survey using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) was proposed to the persons working in 5 ICUs of a French teaching hospital (April 8 to April 21, 2020). Logistic regression was performed to find independent risk factors for anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTDS). A value of pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€° 0.05 was considered significant. The incidence of anxiety and depression were 48% and 16%, respectively. PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms were present in 27% of respondents. The independent risk factors for developing anxiety syndrome were being assigned in COVID-19 + ICU (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.081 [95% confident interval (CI), 1.035-4.184)], and not be trained in intensive care medicine, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.570 [95% CI, 1.344-4.901]. The independent risk factors for PTSD are having a history of burn-out (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.591 [95% CI, 1.464-14.397] and not being trained in ICU, (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.155 [95% CI, 1.047-4.440]). COVID-19 could lead to strong impact on ICU workers. These findings should lead to prevention procedures (ICU training sessions) in persons at risk.","Caillet, Coste, Sanchez, Allaouchiche","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.08.006","20201002","COVID-19; anxiety; caregivers; depression; intensive care unit; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5453,""
"Severe SARS-CoV-2 Disease In The Context Of A NFÃŽÂºB2 Loss-Of-Function Pathogenic Variant","SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged recently and has created a global pandemic. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with a host of symptoms affecting numerous organ systems, including lungs, cardiovascular system, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and skin among others. While several risk factors have been identified related to complications from and severity of COVID-19, much about the virus remains unknown. The host immune response appears to affect the outcome of disease. It is not surprising that patients with intrinsic or secondary immune compromise might be particularly susceptible to complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic loss-of-function (LOF) or gain-of-function (GOF) heterozygous variants in NFÃŽÂºB2 have been reported to be associated with either a combined immunodeficiency (CID) or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) phenotype. We evaluated the functional consequence and immunological phenotype of a novel NFKB2 LOF variant in a 17y old male patient and describe the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this context. This patient required a 2-week hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including seven days of mechanical ventilation. We used biological therapies to avert potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and treat hyperinflammatory responses. The patient had an immunological phenotype of B cell dysregulation with decreased switched memory B cells. Despite the underlying immune dysfunction, he recovered from the infection with intense management. This clinical case exemplifies some of the practical challenges in management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the context of underlying immune dysregulation.","Abraham, Marshall, Kuehn, Rueda, Gibbs, Guider, Stewart, Rosenzweig, Wang, Jean, Peeples, King, Hunt, Honegger, Ramilo, Mustillo, Mejias, Ardura, Shimamura","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.020","20201002","COVID-19; NFkappaB; NFÃŽÂºB pathway; NFÃŽÂºB2; SARS-CoV-2; immunodeficiency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5454,""
"Training During a Pandemic: Successes, Challenges, and Practical Guidance From a Virtual Facilitated Learning Collaborative Training Program for Written Exposure Therapy","In response to COVID-19, continued workforce training is essential to ensure that evidence-based treatments are available on the frontline to meet communities' ongoing and emerging mental health needs. However, training during a pandemic imposes many new challenges. This paper describes a multisite training and implementation pilot program, facets of which allowed for continued training despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social distancing guidelines. This virtual facilitated learning collaborative in Written Exposure Therapy, an evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder, included virtual workshop training, phone-based clinical consultation, implementation-focused video calls for program leadership, and program evaluation. Data are presented about program enrollees and patient impact following the onset of COVID-19-related social distancing restrictions. Challenges, successes, and practical guidance are discussed to inform the field regarding training strategies likely to be durable in an uncertain, dynamic healthcare landscape.","Worley, LoSavio, Aajmain, Rosen, Stirman, Sloan","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22589","20201002","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5455,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on patterns of pregnant women's perception of threat and its relationship to mental state: A latent class analysis","The objective of this study was to define the threatened perception types of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine the correlations between the perception types and their demographic factors, their preventive knowledge of COVID-19 and their mental status in order to provide suggestions for pregnant women during pandemic. Latent class analysis were used to explore the optimal numbers of clusters. Multinomial logistic regression and multiple correspondence analysis were used to analyze the demographic variables of the latent categories. MANOVA was used to analyze the difference of knowledge of COVID-19 obtained among clusters and their psychological status, and chi-square test was used determine the relationship between the latent clusters and the participant's COVID-19 worry level. Five clusters were found: the first cluster (n = 120, 39%) was unthreatened and confident. Cluster 2(n = 84, 28%) was unthreatened but not confident. Cluster 3 (n = 49, 17%) was threatened but confident. Cluster 4 (n = 25, 9%) was threaten, not confident and knowledgeable, and Cluster 5 (n = 20, 7%) was threatened, not confident and lacking knowledge. Three demographic variables were shown an effect on the classification, they were support from work, family support and intrapartum and postpartum complications. This study can help assess the mental health risks of pregnant women during an epidemic. The results could be helpful for families, work units, communities and medical institutions to make targeted intervention decisions for pregnant women.","Qi, Li, Liu, Li, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239697","20201002","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5456,""
"Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Online Survey with a US Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic presented numerous worldwide effects. In the U.S., there have been 2.1 million cases and nearly 116,000 deaths as of June 17, 2020. Based on previous studies of mental health during outbreaks, the mental health of the population will be negatively affected in the aftermath. The long-term nature of this pandemic may lead to unforeseen mental health outcomes and/or unexpected relationships between demographic factors and mental health outcomes. This research focused on assessing the mental health status of adults in the U.S. during the early weeks of an unfolding pandemic. Data was collected from English-speaking adults using an online survey from early April to early June 2020. The final convenience sample included 1,083 U.S. residents. The 71-item survey consisted of demographic questions, mental health and wellbeing measures, a coping mechanisms checklist, and questions about COVID-19-specific concerns. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was utilized to explore associations among demographic variables and mental health outcomes. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine associations among demographic variables, COVID-19-specific concerns, and mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Approximately 50% of the U.S. sample was aged 45 and older. Most of the sample was White (96%), Non-Hispanic (93%), and female (82%). Participants reported high rates of depression (29%), anxiety (34%), and stress (73%). Older individuals were less likely to report depressive symptomology (OR=0.78, P&lt;0.001) and anxiety symptomology (OR=0.72, P&lt;0.001); and they had lower stress scores (-.15 points, SE=.01, P&lt;.001), and increased wellbeing scores (+1.86 points, SE=22, P&lt;.001). Individuals who were no longer working due to COVID-19 were 2.25 times more likely to report symptoms of depression (P=.02), had a .51-point increase in stress (SE=.17, P=.015), and a 3.9-point decrease in wellbeing scores (SE=1.49, P=.009) compared to individuals who were working remotely before and after COVID. Individuals who have partial or no insurance coverage were 2-3 times more likely to report depressive symptomology compared to individuals with full coverage (P=.02; P=.01). Individuals who were on Medicare/Medicaid were 1.97 times more likely, and individuals with no coverage were 4.48 times more likely, to report moderate or severe anxiety (P=.03; P=.01). Financial and food access concerns were significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress (all P&lt;.05), and significantly negatively related to wellbeing (both P&lt;.001). Economy, illness, and death concerns were significantly positively related to overall stress scores (all P&lt;.05). Our findings suggest that many US residents are experiencing high stress, depressive, and anxiety symptomatology, especially among those under/uninsured or unemployed. Longitudinal investigation of these variables is recommended. Health practitioners may provide opportunities to allay concerns or offer coping techniques to individuals in need of mental health care. These messages should be shared in person and through practice websites and social media.","Jewell, Farewell, Welton-Mitchell, Lee-Winn, Walls, Leiferman","https://doi.org/10.2196/22043","20201002","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5457,""

"Shifts in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic: early indications from Australia","The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption is currently unclear. This study aimed to provide early estimates of how stress and demographics will interact with shifts in harmful alcohol consumption from before the COVID-19 outbreak to two months into social distancing. Cross-sectional convenience sample. Australia. 1684 Australians aged 18-65 who drink at least monthly. Items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). Overall, harmful drinking decreased during social distancing measures in our sample (2019 score = 8.2 (7.9-8.4 95% confidence interval), during the pandemic = 7.3 (7.1-7.6)). Younger drinkers, particularly young women, decreased their consumption the most, but there was a small increase in consumption in middle-aged women. Drinkers experiencing high levels of stress also reported a relatively higher shift in harmful consumption compared with those with low levels of stress (ÃŽÂ²=0.65, p=.003), despite reporting a small decrease overall. The closure of licensed premises and social distancing measures in Australia in response to the COVID-19 outbreak appear to have reduced harmful alcohol consumption in younger drinkers, particularly young women.","Callinan, Smit, Mojica-Perez, D'Aquino, Moore, Kuntsche","https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15275","20201002","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5459,""
"Coping with Racism: a Perspective of COVID-19 Church Closures on the Mental Health of African Americans","Academic medical literature and news outlets extensively document how older individuals in communities of color, especially African American communities, are dying disproportionately of COVID-19 due to ongoing societal, racial, and healthcare disparities. Fear of death and suffering are acutely elevated in Black communities; yet, African Americans have been facing, coping with, and overcoming American societal racism and subsequent detriments to our mental health for centuries. Predominately African American churches (hereafter referred to as the &quot;Black Church&quot;) have always served a historical, cultural, contextual, and scientifically validated role in the mental health well-being of African American communities coping with American racism. Nonetheless, buildings of worship closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March 2020. This article is a first-hand perspective of five Black internists/psychiatrists who are deeply involved in both academic medicine and leadership positions within the Black Church. It will explore how the physical closure of Black Churches during this period of increased mental stress, as caused by healthcare inequities revealed by the COVID-19 epidemic, is likely to be uniquely taxing to the mental health of African Americans, particularly older African Americans, who must cope with American racism without physical access to the Black Church for the first time in history.","DeSouza, Parker, Spearman-McCarthy, Duncan, Black","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00887-4","20201002","African American; Black; COVID-19; Church; Racism; Religion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5460,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Drug Overdoses in Indianapolis","We described the change in drug overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in one urban emergency medical services (EMS) system. Data was collected from Marion County, Indiana (Indianapolis), including EMS calls for service (CFS) for suspected overdose, CFS in which naloxone was administered, and fatal overdose data from the County Coroner's Office. With two sample t tests and ARIMA time series forecasting, we showed changes in the daily rates of calls (all EMS CFS, overdose CFS, and CFS in which naloxone was administered) before and after the stay-at-home order in Indianapolis. We further showed differences in the weekly rate of overdose deaths. Overdose CFS and EMS naloxone administration showed an increase with the social isolation of the Indiana stay-at-home order, but a continued increase after the stay-at-home order was terminated. Despite a mild 4% increase in all EMS CFS, overdose CFS increased 43% and CFS with naloxone administration increased 61% after the stay-at-home order. Deaths from drug overdoses increased by 47%. There was no change in distribution of age, race/ethnicity, or zip code of those who overdosed after the stay-at-home order was issued. We hope this data informs policy-makers preparing for future COVID-19 responses and other disaster responses.","Glober, Mohler, Huynh, Arkins, O'Donnell, Carter, Ray","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-020-00484-0","20201002","COVID-19; EMS; Opioid; Overdose; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-03","",5461,""

"The impact of eHealth group interventions on the mental, behavioral, and physical health of adults: a systematic review protocol","COVID-19 has resulted in an increased demand for eHealth services globally. There is emerging evidence for the efficacy for group eHealth interventions that support population-based mental health and wellbeing, but a systematic review is lacking. The primary objective of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence for eHealth group counseling and coaching programs for adults. A second objective is to assess, within studies selected for our primary objective, the impact of programs that encourage PA on outcomes compared to those that do not. Randomized controlled trials that assess the impact of eHealth group counseling or coaching programs on mental health, health behavior, or physical health activity among community-dwelling adults will be included. We will search the following electronic databases (from January 2005 onwards): MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINHAL, and the Central Register of Controlled Trials. The primary outcomes will be changes in mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life), behavioral health conditions (e.g., substance use, smoking, sexual behavior, eating behavior, medication adherence), and physical health conditions (e.g., coping with cancer, menopausal symptoms, arthritis pain). Secondary outcomes will be changes in physical activity. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. A narrative synthesis without meta-analysis will be conducted. The strength of the body of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. The risk of bias in individual studies will be appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Potential sources of gender bias in included studies will be considered at all stages of the planned review. This review will contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the effectiveness of eHealth counseling and coaching programs delivered to adults in a group format.

"Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic","Albeit primarily a disease of respiratory tract, the 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been found to have causal association with a plethora of neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychological effects. This review aims to analyze them with a discussion of evolving therapeutic recommendations. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2020 to 30 May 2020 with the following key terms: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;pandemic&quot;, &quot;neuro-COVID&quot;, &quot;stroke-COVID&quot;, &quot;epilepsy-COVID&quot;, &quot;COVID-encephalopathy&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2-encephalitis&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2-rhabdomyolysis&quot;, &quot;COVID-demyelinating disease&quot;, &quot;neurological manifestations&quot;, &quot;psychosocial manifestations&quot;, &quot;treatment recommendations&quot;, &quot;COVID-19 and therapeutic changes&quot;, &quot;psychiatry&quot;, &quot;marginalised&quot;, &quot;telemedicine&quot;, &quot;mental health&quot;, &quot;quarantine&quot;, &quot;infodemic&quot; and &quot;social media&quot;. A few newspaper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Clinical features of both central and peripheral nervous system involvement are evident. These have been categorically analyzed briefly with literature support. Most of the psychological effects are secondary to pandemic-associated regulatory, socioeconomic and psychosocial changes. Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of this disease are only beginning to unravel.
