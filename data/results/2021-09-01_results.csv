"Increasing incidence of parosmia and phantosmia in patients recovering from COVID-19 smell loss","Importance: Sudden smell loss is a specific early symptom of COVID-19, with an estimated prevalence of ~40% to 75%. Smell impairment affects physical and mental health, and dietary behavior. Thus, it is critical to understand the rate and time course of smell recovery. Objective: To characterize smell function and recovery up to 11 months post COVID-19 infection. Settings, Participants: This longitudinal survey of individuals suffering COVID-19-related smell loss assessed disease symptoms and gustatory and olfactory function. Participants (n=12,313) who completed an initial respiratory symptoms, chemosensory function, and COVID-19 diagnosis survey (S1) between April and September 2020 and completed a follow-up survey (S2) between September 2020 and February 2021; 27.5% participants responded (n=3,386), with 1,468 being diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering co-occurring smell and taste loss at the beginning of their illness. Main Outcomes & Measures: Primary outcomes are ratings of smell and taste function on a visual analog scale, and self-report of parosmia (smell distortions) and phantosmia (unexplained smells). Secondary outcomes include a checklist of other COVID-19 symptoms. Results: On follow-up (median time since COVID-19 onset ~200 days), ~60% of women and ~48% of men reported less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability. Taste typically recovered faster than smell, and taste loss rarely persisted if smell recovered. Prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia was ~10% of participants in S1 and increased substantially in S2: ~47% for parosmia and ~25% for phantosmia. Persistent smell impairment was associated with more symptoms overall, suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID. During COVID-19 illness, the ability to smell was slightly lower among those who did not recover their pre-illness ability to smell at S2. Conclusions and Relevance: While smell loss improves for many individuals who lost it due to COVID-19, the prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia increases substantially over time. Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with wider COVID-19 symptoms and may persist for many months after COVID-19 onset. Taste loss in the absence of smell loss is rare. Persistent qualitative smell symptoms are emerging as common long-term sequelae; more research into treatment options is strongly warranted given that conservative estimates suggest millions of individuals may experience parosmia following COVID-19. Healthcare providers worldwide need to be prepared to treat post COVID-19 secondary effects on physical and mental health.","Kathrin Ohla; Maria G Veldhuizen; Tomer Green; Mackenzie E Hannum; Alyssa J Bakke; Shima Moein; Arnaud Tognetti; Elbrich M Postma; Robert Pellegrino; Liang-Dar Hwang; Javier Albayay; Sachiko Koyama; Alissa Nolden; Thierry Thomas-Danguin; Carla Mucignat-Caretta; Nick S Menger; Iljia Croijmans; Lina Ozturk; Huseyin Yanik; Denis Pierron; Veronica Pereda-Loth; Alexia Nunez-Parra; Aldair M Martinez Pineda; David Gillespie; Michael C Farruggia; Cinzia Cecchetto; Carl Philpott; Vera Voznessenskaya; Keiland Cooper; Paloma Rohlfs Dominguez; Orietta Calcinoni; Jasper de Groot; Sanne Boesveldt; Surabhi Bhutani; Elisabeth M Weir; Cara Exten; Paule V Joseph; Valentina Parma; John E Hayes; Masha Y Niv","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.28.21262763","20210831","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17577,""
"Knowledge assessment and outcomes of otolaryngology practice amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in a busy ENT department","Otolaryngology health personnel are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 disease and, hence, are likely to have high stress levels. This study was designed to evaluate the feedback of otolaryngology healthcare workers in ENT departments who are managing patients in the coronavirus pandemic. A questionnaire focused on all aspects of healthcare delivery was completed by otolaryngology healthcare workers. The findings, based on statistical analyses, included high stress levels and inadequate disease-related information in these workers. Healthcare authorities need to take care of issues related to mental health in healthcare professionals in addition to spreading awareness about safe practices. Further studies are needed to continuously monitor feedback from personnel as the coronavirus pandemic unravels in the future.","Agarwal, Agarwal, Chandra, Mishra, Agarwal","https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2021.0004","20210831","COVID-19; Healthcare worker; Otolaryngology; Pandemic; Personal protective equipment; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17578,""
"Depression in the pediatric otolaryngology clinic setting","For most pediatric specialty clinics, mental health is not the primary presenting complaint yet can portend unrecognized morbidity. We describe rates and risk factors of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents seen at a pediatric specialty clinic and examine changes during COVID-19. Outpatient pediatric otolaryngology clinic encounters of patients ages 12-19 at a tertiary academic medical center were identified from October 2018 to July 2020. Demographic characteristics, ICD-10 primary diagnosis, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 score, and PHQ-9 score (if administered) were obtained. Multivariable regression examined risk factors for PHQ-9 administration, PHQ-9 scores Ã¢â€°Â¥10, and suicidal ideation. Patient characteristics and PHQ scores were compared before and after March 23, 2020 (California COVID-19 Stay-at-Home order). 3,609 encounters with PHQ-2 data were identified. Of these, 223 (6.2%) scored Ã¢â€°Â¥3 and underwent PHQ-9 assessment. 121 (3.4% of 3,609) scored Ã¢â€°Â¥10 on the PHQ-9 and 53 (1.5%) endorsed suicidal ideation. Factors associated with PHQ-9 administration were female gender (OR 1.58, p=0.001), obesity (OR 1.48, p=0.043), and Neck Mass/Neoplasm/Cancer diagnosis (OR 1.99, p=0.013). Female gender was also associated with suicidality (OR 2.47, p=0.008). Comparison pre-COVID-19 vs. during COVID-19 showed no differences in depression or suicidality. However subgroup analysis revealed some significant findings. We demonstrate substantial prevalence of positive depression screening and suicidal ideation among adolescent pediatric otolaryngology clinic encounters. Depression rates were similar pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19, yet barriers to screening during this time were substantial. Pediatric specialty providers must remain vigilant for mental health issues in their patients. This article is protected by copyright.

"Depressive symptoms among frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kelantan, Malaysia: A cross sectional study","Healthcare providers are vulnerable in the fight against COVID-19 and may experience significant psychological and mental health consequences. This study aimed to compare the levels of depressive symptoms among frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in two government hospitals managing COVID-19-related cases in Kelantan, Malaysia from May to July 2020 to identify and compared depressive symptoms levels of frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers. Convenient sampling was applied in the selection of eligible participants and those diagnosed as having any psychiatric illnesses were excluded. The self-administered questionnaires for the Malay versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure depressive symptoms score and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey to measure social support score as an important confounder. A descriptive analysis, independent t-test and ANCOVA were performed using SPSS version 26. A total of 306 respondents from healthcare providers were recruited which 160 were frontline healthcare providers and 146 were non-frontline healthcare providers. The level of depressive symptoms (HADS score &gt;8) was 27.5% for the frontline healthcare providers and 37.7% for the non-frontline healthcare providers. The mean depressive symptoms score for the non-frontline healthcare providers was 0.75 points higher than that of the frontline healthcare providers after adjusting for gender, duration of employment and social support. Non-frontline healthcare providers are also experiencing psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic even though they do not have direct contact with COVID-19 patients.","Norhayati, Che Yusof, Azman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256932","20210831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17580,""
"Marked self-limiting sinus bradycardia in COVID-19 patients not requiring therapy in the intensive care unit - case series report","Cardiovascular complications of the COVID-19 comprise cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia (SB). The authors present clinical data of 19 hospitalized patients (12 males), aged 20-73 years, with marked (less than 45/min during daily hours) self-limiting SB. None of them had SB at admission or earlier, none had used cardiovascular medications potentially decreasing the heart rate. Pulmonary involvement was severe in 4, moderate in 13 and mild in 2 patients; 14 needed oxygen therapy (4 using high flow oxygen equipment), none required treatment in the intensive care unit. All patients were given low molecular weight heparin in a prophylactic dose, 13 intravenous ceftriaxone, 12 dexamethasone, 8 convalescent plasma. Before SB appearance, 12 patients were treated with remdesivir (3 patients did not receive a full planned dose) and 2 with tocilizumab. SB appeared suddenly on day 5-14 from the onset of the disease, with a minimal heart rate of 32-44/min and in 3 cases it was mildly symptomatic; 2 of those received ad-hoc atropine, one orciprenaline. Interleukin-6 (Il-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at SB onset were significantly lower than at admission (9.3 vs 70.0 pg/ml and 16.8 vs 98.5 mg/l, respectively). Cardiac troponin I was slightly elevated in 2 patients. ECG morphology abnormalities (transient negative T waves or ST depression) were found in 4 males. All subjects had normal left ventricular ejection fraction; in 5 echocardiography revealed small pericardial effusion; in 10 patients, longitudinal strain was also studied: reginal abnormalities were found in all of them, particularly in basal segments. SB lasted 3-11 days and was reversible in all patients; none required temporary stimulation. The COVID-19 course was favorable in all patients; they were stable at discharge. During 4-12 months of posthospital observation, including clinical features, control ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring, none of the patients was qualified for pacemaker implantation.","Elikowski, Fertala, Zawodna-Marszalek, Rajewska-Tabor, Swidurski, Wajdlich, Marszalek, Skrzywanek, Pyda, Zytkiewicz","https://www.google.com/search?q=Marked+self-limiting+sinus+bradycardia+in+COVID-19+patients+not+requiring+therapy+in+the+intensive+care+unit+-+case+series+report.","20210831","24-hour Holter monitoring; COVID-19; CRP; ECG; echocardiography; interleukin-6; longitudinal strain; remdesivir; sinus bradycardia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17581,""
"Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and Health related Quality of life (HRQoL)- A systematic review and Meta-analysis","There is established literature on symptoms and complications of COVID-19 but after effects of COVID-19 are not well understood with few studies reporting persistent symptoms and quality of life. We aim to evaluate pooled prevalence of poor quality of life in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and conducted meta-regression to evaluate effects of persistent symptoms and ICU admission on poor quality of life. We extracted data from observational studies describing persistent symptoms and quality of life in post COVID-19 patients from March 10, 2020 to March 10, 2021 following PRISMA guidelines with a consensus of two independent reviewers. We calculated the pooled prevalence with 95% CI and created forest plots using random-effects models. A total of 12 studies with 4828 PCS patients were included. We found that amongst PCS patients, pooled prevalence of poor quality of life (EQ-VAS) was (59%; 95%CI:42-75%). Based on individual factors in EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, prevalence of mobility was (36,10-67), personal care (8,1-21), usual quality (28,2-65), pain/discomfort (42,28-55), and anxiety/depression (38,19-58). The prevalence of persistent symptoms was fatigue (64,54-73), dyspnea (39.5,20-60), anosmia (20,15-24), arthralgia (24.3,14-36), headache (21,3-47), sleep disturbances (47,7-89) and mental health (14.5,4-29). Meta-regression analysis showed poor quality of life was significantly higher among post COVID-19 patients with ICU admission (p=0.004) and fatigue (p=0.0015). Our study concludes that PCS is associated with poor quality of life, persistent symptoms including fatigue, dyspnea, anosmia, sleep disturbances and worse mental health. This suggests that we need more research on PCS patients to understand the risk factors causing it and eventually leading to poor quality of life. This article is protected by copyright.

"Exercise Management Using a Mobile App in Patients With Parkinsonism: Prospective, Open-Label, Single-Arm Pilot Study","Patients with parkinsonism have higher inactivity levels than the general population, and this results in increased comorbidities. Although exercise has benefits for motor function and quality of life (QOL) in patients with parkinsonism, these patients face many barriers to exercise participation, such as lack of motivation, fatigue, depression, and time constraints. Recently, the use of mobile apps has been highlighted as a remote exercise management strategy for patients with chronic diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of home-based exercise management with a customized mobile app on the exercise amount, physical activity, and QOL of patients with parkinsonism. This was a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study. The therapist installed the app in the smartphones of the participants and educated them on how to use the app. The therapist developed an individualized multimodal exercise program that consisted of stretching, strengthening, aerobic, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercises. Participants were encouraged to engage in an 8-week home-based exercise program delivered through a customized app. The alarm notifications of the app provided reminders to exercise regularly at home. The primary outcome was the exercise amount. The secondary outcomes were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The usability of the customized app was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. A total of 21 participants with parkinsonism completed the intervention and assessment between September and December 2020 (mean age: 72 years; women: 17/21, 81%; men: 4/21, 19%). The participants reported a significant increase in the total amount of exercise (baseline: mean 343.33, SD 206.70 min/week; 8-week follow-up: mean 693.10, SD 373.45 min/week; P&lt;.001) and in the amount of each exercise component, including stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercise after 8 weeks. Analysis of the secondary outcomes revealed significant improvements in the IPAQ (P=.006), PDQ-39 (P=.02), and GDS (P=.04) scores. The usability of the program with the mobile app was verified based on the positive responses such as ""intention to use"" and ""role expectation for rehabilitation."" Exercise management with a customized mobile app may be beneficial for improving exercise adherence, physical activity levels, depression management, and QOL in patients with parkinsonism. This remotely supervised technology-based, reinforcing, and multimodal exercise management strategy is recommended for use in patients with parkinsonism. In addition, this program proved useful as an alternative exercise management strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic when patients with Parkinson disease were less physically active than before and showed aggravation of symptoms. However, additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this exercise program in a large population and to confirm its disease-modifying effects.","Kim, Yun, Sung, Kim, Jo, Cho, Park, Oh, Seo","https://doi.org/10.2196/27662","20210831","Parkinson; Parkinsonian disorders; exercise; mhealth; mobile apps","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17584,""

"Impacts of the Coronavirus Pandemic on the Emotional and Physical Health of Older Adults Compared with Younger Cohorts","This study compared emotional and physical health and overall well-being related to social restrictions during the pandemic among older, middle-aged, and younger adults in the United States (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 276). Online surveys collected information on mental and physical health, as well as positive and negative impacts of the pandemic. One-way MANOVAs and hierarchical regressions were used to analyze data. Depressive symptoms and coronavirus anxiety differed significantly by age, with older adults reporting less depressive and anxious symptoms than younger cohorts. Negative COVID experiences significantly predicted higher levels of stress, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in younger adults as compared to older cohorts. Findings indicate that social restrictions had a more substantial negative impact amongst younger adults compared to older adults, particularly in terms of mental health and well-being. Older adults may be more resilient to the impacts of the pandemic than younger cohorts and thus may serve as a critical resource for how to navigate crisis situations of this nature.

"Association of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Low-rescue Suicide Attempts in Patients Visiting the Emergency Department after Attempting Suicide","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the total number of suicide attempts and the proportion of low-rescue attempts. We investigated the factors affecting low-rescue suicide attempts using the risk-rescue rating scale (RRRS) among patients who visited the emergency department (ED) after attempting suicide before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively investigated suicide attempts made by patients who visited our ED from March 2019 to September 2020. Patients were classified into two groups based on whether they attempted suicide before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on demographic variables, psychiatric factors, suicide risk factors and rescue factors were collected and compared. A total of 518 patients were included in the study, 275 (53.1%) of whom attempted suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of patients who made low-rescue suicide attempts differed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (37.1% vs. 28.8%) (<i>P</i> = 0.046).

"Predictors of critical care nurses' stress, anxiety, and depression in response to COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic directly affects the psychological well-being of critical care nurses. Several studies had investigated the psychological impact of the pandemic on nurses caring for patients with COVID-19, but few were conducted to identify the predictors of this impact. The objective of this study is to identify the predictors of critical care nurses' stress, anxiety, and depression in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five intensive care units in five hospitals in Alexandria, Egypt. An online questionnaire was distributed. It included socio-demographic and work-related data and the depression, anxiety, and stress scale scores of the nurses under study. A multiple linear regression model was developed to identify the predictors of critical care nurses' stress, anxiety, and depression in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two hundred (64%) of 308 nurses completed the electronic questionnaire. Significant predictors of stress included the number of infected colleagues (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and availability of hospital resources (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .01). Significant predictors of anxiety were age, gender, satisfactory income (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), years of experience, time spent caring for patients with COVID-19 (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .04), continuous training, number of infected colleagues (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .01), and availability of hospital resources (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .02). Finally, significant predictors of depression included gender, history of physical problems (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .04), educational attainment, availability of hospital resources, history of psychological problems (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and number of infected colleagues (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .001). The hospital's lack of human and physical resources and the number of colleagues infected with COVID-19 were the strongest predictors of stress, anxiety, and depression among nurses. Identifying the predictors of stress, anxiety, and depression among nurses who care for patients with COVID-19 is a vital step in developing mental health promotion strategies to support nurses during this pandemic.","Baraka, Ramadan, Hassan","https://doi.org/10.1111/nicc.12708","20210831","COVID-19; anxiety; critical care nurses; depression; predictors; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17588,""
"Effects of Spike Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern on Human or Animal ACE2-Mediated Virus Entry and Neutralization","SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic agent capable of infecting humans and a wide range of animal species. Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) have arisen in circulating viral populations, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOC) with varying degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we employed lentivirus-based pseudotyped viruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that stably express ACE2 from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the parental (prototype Wuhan-1) S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions (e.g., 452R, 478K, 501Y) did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency in viral entry. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with significantly increased entry capacity of pseudotyped viruses compared to that of the parental Wuhan-1 pseudotyped virus. Similarly, infection studies using live ancestral (USA-WA1/2020), Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 viruses in hamsters revealed a higher replication potential for the Beta variant compared to the ancestral prototype virus. Moreover, neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species, including humans, were significantly reduced by single substitutions of 484K or 452R, double substitutions of 501Y-484K, 452R-484K and 452R-478K and the triple substitution of 501Y-484K-417N, suggesting that 484K and 452R are particularly important for evading neutralizing antibodies in human, cat, and rabbit sera. Cumulatively, this study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication and antibody-mediated viral neutralization. Cells stably expressing ACE2 from various animals and a lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus assay were established to study SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The results demonstrated that ACE2 from a wide range of animal species facilitate S-mediated virus entry into cells, which is supported by <i>in silico</i> data as well as natural and experimental infection studies. Pseudotyped viruses containing mutations in the RBD of S representative of the Alpha, Gamma, and especially Beta, variants of concern demonstrated that certain mutations are associated with increased viral entry compared to the parental S. The Beta variant was also observed to have a replicative advantage <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> compared to the prototype virus. Pseudotyped viruses containing combinatorial substitutions of 501Y-484K-417K, 614G-501Y-484K and 614G-501Y-484K-417N increased viral entry via ACE2 across multiple species. The 501Y or 478K single substitution did not significantly affect neutralizing capacity of immune sera compared to the prototype strain, but the addition of 484K or 452R substitutions significantly reduced the neutralizing titers.","Kim, Gaudreault, Meekins, Perera, Bold, Trujillo, Morozov, McDowell, Chang, Richt","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.25.457627","20210831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17589,""
"The Role of Mindfulness and Life Satisfaction in Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Lockdown in New Zealand: a Quasi-experimental Study","Quantitative research on the psychological effects of lockdown conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to inform mental health interventions which aim to alleviate potential adverse effects. The goal of this study was to investigate psychological distress during the lockdown in New Zealand. We implemented a longitudinal quasi-experimental research design using a sample (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°81) who completed surveys on mindfulness, satisfaction with life, and mental health indicators at three time-points, separated by at least 2-week intervals. The sample was divided into two parts, the baseline group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44) and the lockdown group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37). The baseline group completed the surveys the first time prior to lockdown, and mostly completed the second and third surveys during lockdown. The lockdown group mostly completed the survey for the first time during lockdown and the second and third surveys during or after lockdown. Mindfulness and satisfaction with life at baseline significantly predicted lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during uncertain and emergency conditions before and during lockdown. The baseline group experienced significantly less anxiety and stress during lockdown compared to just prior to the lockdown (baseline condition). Individuals who have higher levels of mindfulness and those with greater life satisfaction experience significantly less depression, anxiety, and stress over time, during both uncertain and emergency conditions such as during the threat of COVID-19. The finding of anxiety and stress reduction during lockdown may be specific to New Zealand, as conditions differ in many ways from those in other countries. Preventative measures which increase mindfulness and satisfaction with life could help alleviate depression, anxiety, and stress during uncertain and emergency conditions.

"Mental Health-Related Emergency Department Visits in Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicentric Retrospective Study","The purpose of this study was to compare pre/post-COVID-19 changes in mental health-relatedÃ‚Â emergency department visits among adolescents. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all mental health-related emergency department visits in two large tertiary pediatric hospital centers between January 2018 and December 2020. We described monthly pre/post-COVID-19 changes in frequency and proportion of mental health visits as well as changes in hospitalization rates for eating disorders, suicidality, substance use, and other mental health conditions. We found an increase in the proportion of mental health-related emergency department visits during the months of July-December 2020 (p &lt; .01). There was a 62% increase in eating disorder visits between 2018-2019 and 2020 (p &lt; .01). No pre pandemic/postpandemic changes were found in the proportion of visits resulting in hospitalization for any of the four diagnostic categories. Our study suggests significant impacts of COVID-19 on adolescent mental health and a need for further longitudinal research work in this area.","Chadi, Spinoso-Di Piano, Osmanlliu, Gravel, Drouin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.036","20210831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17591,""
"Stress and work-related burnout in frontline health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting humankind in unprecedented and monumental ways. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations at work. However, the current understanding of the emotional effects on HCPs and their vulnerability during the pandemic is limited. We investigated the effects of HCPs' viral epidemic-related stress, professional quality of life (ProQOL), depression, and anxiety on their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We recruited a convenience sample of 60 HCPs at two tertiary hospitals in provinces P and Y, Republic of Korea. We analyzed their demographics, viral epidemic-related distress, ProQOL (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress), depression, anxiety, and HRQOL through self-reported questionnaires. Burnout had a significant direct effect on depression, anxiety, physical health, and psychological HRQOL and indirectly affected all subcategories of HRQOL. Viral epidemic-related stress had no significant direct effect on any variable, but indirectly affected all subcategories of HRQOL. Depression and anxiety were endogenous variables (mediators). Depression was a pathway that directly and significantly affected all subcategories of HRQOL. Burnout had the most significant effect on physical health and psychological HRQOL, whereas depression had the greatest effect on social relationships and environmental HRQOL. Low compassion satisfaction caused burnout in HCPs, and burnout was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and HRQOL. Furthermore, HRQOL showed a greater response when affected by indirect burnout through depression and anxiety than when directly affected by burnout.","Lee, Yun, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.279","20210831","COVID-19; SAVE-9 (stress and anxiety to viral epidemic scale); burnout; depression; healthcare professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","",17592,""
