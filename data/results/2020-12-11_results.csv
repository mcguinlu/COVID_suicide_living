"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students' health and financial stability in New York City: Findings from a population-based sample of City University of New York (CUNY) students","Understanding the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on students' health and financial stability is important to establish effective interventions to mitigate these effects, which may have long-term consequences on their health and well-being. Public universities in urban centers represent a substantial proportion of college students in the United States. We implemented a cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2,282 students in a large, public university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for non-response and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and half (49.8) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR=1.4, 9%% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR=1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the strongest predictors of anxiety/depression. Household and personal experiences with possible COVID-19 symptoms were also associated with anxiety/depression or the need for increased mental health services. Addressing student needs at public urban universities requires an integrated holistic approach that targets urgent mental health and economic needs related to the impact of COVID-19. Students who became infected need mental health services as well as health monitoring.","Heidi E Jones; Meredith Manze; Victoria Ngo; Patricia Lamberson; Nicholas Freudenberg","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246074","20201211","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8063,""
"Will the COVID-19 pandemic lead to a tsunami of suicides? A Swedish nationwide analysis of historical and 2020 data","Background: Various surveys have documented a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population's mental health. There is widespread concern about a surge of suicides, but evidence supporting a link between global pandemics and suicide is very limited. Using historical data from the three major influenza pandemics of the 20th century, and recently released data from the first half of 2020, we aimed to investigate whether an association exists between influenza deaths and suicide deaths. Methods: Annual data on influenza death rates and suicide rates were extracted from the Statistical Yearbook of Sweden from 1910-1978, covering the three 20th century pandemics, and from Statistics Sweden for the period from January to June of each year during 2000-2020. COVID-19 death data were available for the first half of 2020. We implemented non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) models to explore if there is a short-term and/or long-term effect of increases and decreases in influenza death rates on suicide rates during 1910-1978. Analyses were done separately for men and women. Descriptive analyses were used for the available 2020 data. Findings: Between 1910-1978, there was no evidence of either short-term or long-term significant associations between influenza death rates and changes in suicides. The same pattern emerged in separate analyses for men and women. Suicide rates in January-June 2020 revealed a slight decrease compared to the corresponding rates in January-June 2019 (relative decrease by -1.2% among men and -12.8% among women). Interpretation: We found no evidence of short or long-term association between influenza death rates and suicide death rates across three 20th century pandemics or during the first six months of 2020 (when the first wave of COVID-19 occurred). Concerns about a substantial increase of suicides may be exaggerated. The media should be cautious when reporting news about suicides during the current pandemic.","Christian Ruck; David Mataix-Cols; Kinda Malki; Mats Adler; Oskar Flygare; Bo Runeson; Anna Sidorchuk","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20244699","20201211","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8064,""
"Social Media Insights Into US Mental Health Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic A Longitudinal Twitter Analysis (JANUARY-APRIL 2020)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a significant challenge to the world's mental health and healthcare systems. Considering traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health. Significant pluralities of the US population now use social media platforms, such as Twitter, to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field from which to understand personal wellbeing. Purpose: Broadly, this study answers three research questions: RQ1: What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID19?; RQ2: To what extent does social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic?; and RQ3: Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Methods: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English-language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n = 354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment tool. Results: LDA topics generated in the early months of the dataset corresponded to major COVID-19 specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted towards US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis sentiment scores of user timelines were initially high and stable, but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March. Discussion & Conclusion: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased usage rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media usage on mental health, for many social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental healthcare structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.","Danny Valdez; Marijn ten Thij; Krishna C Bathina; Laruen A Rutter; Johan Bollen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20241943","20201210","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8065,""

"Social Media Use Provides Health Information Support and Contributes to Psychiatric Disorders during China's COVID-19 Outbreak","A great deal of work has been devoted to examining the mental health of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 or medical staff who cared and treated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. But few insights were produced concerning how the pandemic may take a toll on the public's mental health who were not contracted with the virus. This study aims to investigate the links between social media use and mental health conditions in the general population based on a national sample (N = 2,185) collected at the peak of China's COVID-19 outbreak. This study reveals the public's mental health conditions by analyzing social media use among those who experienced the first COVID-19 outbreak in the world. A nationally representative sample was collected for this study in China's 30 provinces concerning the participants' social media use, health information support, and psychiatric disorders, i.e., secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma (VT). COVID-19 had taken a severe toll on people's mental health who had no history of psychiatric disorders nor being contracted with coronavirus. Social media use did not cause mental health issues, but it mediated the levels of traumatic emotions. While people gained health information support in using social media, an excessive social media use led to elevated levels of stress (ÃŽÂ² = .175, P &lt; .001), anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = .224, P &lt; .001), depression (ÃŽÂ² = .201, P &lt; .001), STS (ÃŽÂ² = .307, P &lt; .001), and VT (ÃŽÂ² = .688, P &lt; .001). Geo-location and lockdown conditions also contributed to traumatic disorders. People from small cities or towns were more anxious (P = .01) and depressed (P = .008) than those in rural areas. Obtaining more informational support (ÃŽÂ² = .165, P &lt; .001) and emotional support (ÃŽÂ² = .144, P &lt; .001) on social media increased VT. Peer support on social media increased both VT (ÃŽÂ² = .332, P &lt; .001) and STS (ÃŽÂ² = .130, P &lt; .001). Moreover, geo-location moderated the relationships between emotional support on social media and VT (F(2) = 3.549, P = .029) and the association between peer support and STS (F(2) = 5.059, P = .006). Geo-location also interacted with information support in predicting STS (F(2) = 5.093, P = .006). This research contributes to the literature by establishing the association between social media use and psychiatric disorders in the general public when COVID-19 struck, whose causes were complex and multifactorial, including social media use. The findings based on what Chinese people went through can help global citizens and health policymakers to mitigate psychiatric disorders in this and other public health crises, which should be a key component of global pandemic response.","Zhong, Jiang, Xie, Qin","https://doi.org/10.2196/23696","20201210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8076,""
"Whether and how lockdown and mandatory quarantine regarding COVID-19 may affect mental health among pregnant women in China: Potential social, cognitive, and eHealth-related mechanisms","Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease in the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns are raised over their threat to mental health especially among vulnerable groups including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have tested whether and how these control measures may affect mental health. No study investigated prevalence and impacts of utilizing eHealth among pregnant women during the outbreak. This study investigated 1) the roles of lockdown and mandatory quarantine in affecting mental health problems (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms), 2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and 3) the moderation roles of eHealth-related factors (i.e., social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services during COVID-19) among pregnant women in China. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions (24 February-10 March, 2020). Of the participants, 62.6% reported lockdown in the areas of residence and 3.8% were subjected to mandatory quarantine; 44.6% reported probable depression, 29.2% had probable anxiety, and 7.4% reported suicidal ideation. Only 3.3% of the participants reported using online prenatal care service during the outbreak. Significant socio-demographic/maternal variables of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, area of residence, gestational duration, number of children born, complication during pregnancy, means of utilizing prenatal care services, and social media use for health information. Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) modeling [Ãâ€¡2(df)=495.21(14), p&lt;.05, CFI=.99, NNFI=.98, RMSEA=.04 (90%CI=.038, .045)] showed quarantine status was strongly associated with poor mental health status directly and indirectly through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04, ÃŽÂ² =.02, 95%CI=.01 to .02, p=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03, ÃŽÂ²=.03, 95%CI=.02 to .03, p=.001). Multi-group analyses revealed social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. The findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance to integrate mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policy. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators are modifiable, and can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.","Yang, Song, Wu, Mo, Di, Wang, Lau, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2196/24495","20201210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8077,""
"Pulmonary function and health-related quality of life after COVID-19 pneumonia","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many cases of pneumonia with extensive lung abnormalities on CT-scans. The consequences of COVID-19 pneumonia on survivors' pulmonary function and quality of life are unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on pulmonary function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived dyspnoea. A prospective longitudinal cohort study regarding patients discharged from our hospital after PCR-proven, non-critical COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. Cases were classified as moderate or severe pneumonia according to WHO definitions. Six weeks post-discharge subjects underwent interviews and pulmonary function tests, and completed questionnaires to assess their HRQoL, perceived dyspnoea (Borgscale and mMRC), and symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS). 101 patients were included. Twenty-eight (27.7%) pneumonias were classified as moderate cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and 73 (72.3%) were classified as severe cases. Diffusion limitation (DLCOcÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 80% of predicted value) was found in 66 (71.7%) of 92 cases, obstruction in 26 (25.7%) of 101, and restriction in 21 (21.2%) of 99. Diffusion capacity was significantly lower in cases after severe pneumonia. In the entire group, HADS scores Ã¢â€°Â¥8 for depression were found in 16.6% and in 12.5% for anxiety. Across all SF-36 domains, except for bodily pain, significant impairment was found. FEV1 and DLCOc showed significant positive correlations with mMRC scores and multiple SF-36 domains, especially physical functioning. COVID-19 non-critical pneumonia survivors have significant impairment in diffusion capacity and HRQOL six weeks after being discharged from hospital.","van der Sar-van der Brugge, Talman, Boonman-de Winter, de Mol, Hoefman, van Etten, De Backer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106272","20201210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8078,""
"Worry and insomnia as risk factors for depression during initial stages of COVID-19 pandemic in India","The biggest nationwide COVID-19 pandemic lockdown worldwide was enforced in India for an initial period of 21-days. Emerging evidence suggests that pandemic situations and associated lockdowns have an adverse impact on sleep and mental health. However, prediction of sleep health from sociodemographic characteristics and the public's worry during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been extensively explored so far. It's also unclear whether sleep outcomes mediate the association between worry and mental health during pandemic situations. A web-survey (N = 391) on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related worry, sleep health (insomnia and daytime sleepiness), and depression was conducted during the initial 21-days of the COVID-19 stringent lockdown in India. Multiple regression analyses showed that variables, including sex, age, income level, and worry score, contributed to the significant regression equation for insomnia but not for daytime sleepiness. Specifically, the female, younger, lower income, and highly worried populations contributed significantly more than the male, elderly, higher income, and less worried populations, respectively, to the prediction of insomnia. Mediation analyses showed that insomnia, but not daytime sleepiness, fully mediated the relationship between worry score and severity of depressive symptoms. We provide evidence that the female, younger, lower income, and worried populations may be at higher risk for insomnia during pandemic situations. Current evidence gives hope that improving sleep may reduce depressive symptoms during a pandemic situation. This underscores the importance of the implementation of effective public health policies in conjunction with strategical responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bajaj, Blair, Schwartz, Dobbertin, Blair","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243527","20201210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8079,""

Primary exposure was a history of chronic conditions which was defined using self-reported diagnoses of cardiometabolic, respiratory, immune-related, mental health conditions, and overweight/obesity. Primary outcomes were attitudes of COVID-19 mHealth including (1) likelihood of using a mobile-phone app to track COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations, (2) likelihood of using a website to track COVID-19 symptoms, location, and receive recommendations, and (3) likelihood of using an app using location to track potential COVID-19 exposure. COVID-19 mHealth use outcome response options were extremely/very likely, moderately likely, or not too likely/not likely at all. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare likelihood of COVID-19 mHealth use across chronic health conditions, with not too likely/not likely at all as the reference category for each outcome. We evaluated determinants of each form of COVID-19 mHealth intervention using Poisson regression. Among the 10,760 respondents, about half were aged 30-59 years, female, had a household income &lt;$50,000, and had employer-sponsored insurance. Overall, 22% were extremely/very likely to use a mobile-phone app or a website to track their COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations. Almost one-quarter were extremely/very likely to use a mobile-phone app to track their location and receive push notifications if they have been exposed to COVID-19. After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and residence, adults living with mental health conditions were most likely to report being either extremely/very or moderately likely to use each mHealth intervention when compared to those who were not likely. Adults with respiratory-related chronic diseases were extremely/very (cOR:1.16, 95% CI:1.00-1.35) and moderately likely (cOR:1.23, 95% CI:1.04-1.45) to use a mobile-phone app to track their location and send push notifications if they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Across each mHealth intervention, positive determinants of extremely/very likely use included being female, racial/ethnic minority, and having at least one recent COVID-19 related symptom. Our study demonstrates that attitudes towards COVID-19 mHealth use vary widely by modality (web-based vs. app) and across chronic health conditions. These findings may inform adoption of and long-term engagement with COVID-19 apps, a crucial factor for determining their potential to reduce disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among individuals with chronic health conditions.","Camacho-Rivera, Islam, Rivera, Vidot","https://doi.org/10.2196/24693","20201210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8080,""

"Experiences of Mental Health Clinicians and Staff in Rapidly Converting to Full-Time Telemental Health and Work from Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> The mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic pushed much of the mental health workforce to rapidly convert to full-time telemental health (TMH). For many people, this occurred in the context of working from makeshift home offices with novel distractions. We describe the results of an online survey of mental health clinicians and staff regarding their experiences in rapidly converting to full-time TMH and work from home (WFH) during COVID-19. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> Fourteen clinicians and 11 administrative staff from two outpatient mental health clinics in a large academic medical center completed the survey in May 2020. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> More than 85% of participants rated the experience of providing or supporting full-time TMH care as &quot;somewhat better&quot; or &quot;much better than expected.&quot; Clinicians and administrative staff reported perceptions that most clients were satisfied with TMH services. Identified TMH challenges included difficulty providing clinical forms and difficulties with technology. Identified benefits of WFH included lack of commute, time with loved ones, opportunities for self-care, and increased flexibility. Maintaining team cohesion and communication while working remotely, and setting boundaries between work and nonwork hours were identified as challenges. Nearly all respondents indicated a preference to continue some TMH from home in the future. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Findings suggest that rapidly adopting TMH and WFH during a pandemic were well accepted. Should the progression of the pandemic require agile movement in and out of TMH and WFH, overcommunication and extra attention to supporting employee connection and morale are especially important.","Steidtmann, McBride, Mishkind","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0305","20201210","behavioral health; pandemic; psychology; telehealth; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8082,""
"Adolescent Psychiatric Emergencies Precipitated by the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this retrospective case series was to describe adolescent psychiatric emergencies precipitated by the 2020 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) pandemic. This study used a sample of adolescents admitted to a safety net psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles, California between March and May 2020. Medical records and involuntary psychiatric holds were reviewed to determine if the events precipitating the psychiatric crisis were related to the pandemic (eligible N = 14). COVID-19-precipitated admissions were 24% of total admissions from March 15 to May 31, 2020; however, total admissions during this time period were reduced from the same time period in prior years. Most hospitalizations were precipitated by shelter-in-place stressors for adolescents with a psychiatric history, but for 28.6% of the sample, this was their first mental health encounter. The COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding shelter-in-place orders may precipitate psychiatric emergencies among adolescents with and without existing mental health disorders.

"<i>World of Change</i>: Reflections within an educational and health care perspective in a time with COVID-19","Besides handling the physical impacts of COVID-19 there is more than ever a need to understand what can help when mental health is challenged. Within this context our practical wisdom - our ability to understand and recognise when 'the other', for example the patient, is feeling lonely or anxious is particularly important. This article aims to contribute to the understanding of how the competence of health professionals may be advanced by helping them develop the self-understanding essential to being wise practitioners. The article is based on a discussion informed by reflections (written in Danish and translated into English) by Masters students (and registered nurses) participating in a university programme &quot;Patient and user focused nursing&quot;. The first part of the article considers a student nurse's reflection on understanding herself and one of her patients. The second part considers reflections on the contemporary world of change from a student nurse trying to engage with a world she experiences as falling apart. The third part addresses the impact of resonant places and encounters on developing self/other understandings; encounters that may also be produced through songs and lyrics. The final part draws conclusions on how it is possible to reach understandings of oneself and others as student health practitioners in time of a pandemic. In the process of developing understanding and recognition, competence built on self-understanding is central for helping form health professionals into 'wise practitioners'. It is concluded that the existential implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, paradoxically, may direct many people's awareness to a more sensitive, resonant, attitude towards the other. For some, this may produce a more humanized world and perception of others. Within this perspective the arts may help us develop self-understanding and recognition of 'the other'.","Damsgaard, Phoenix","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020979025","20201210","Education; change; practical wisdom; resonance; sensory approach; understanding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8085,""

"Academics in the Pandemic: Early Impact of COVID-19 on Plastic Surgery Training Programs","The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted plastic surgery training in the United States, requiring unprecedented measures to prepare for potential surges in critically ill patients. This study investigates how plastic surgery programs responded to this crisis, as well as how successful these changes were, through a survey of program directors and of residents at academic training programs in the United States. Two separate anonymous online surveys were conducted via REDCap between April 16 and June 4, 2020. The first survey was distributed to program directors, and the second was distributed to plastic surgery residents. Resident responses were then subdivided for an analysis between geographic regions. Of the 59 program director responses (43.7%), the majority of programs implemented a platoon approach for resident coverage. A minority did the same for attending coverage. In total, 92% transitioned to virtual didactics only. Plastic surgery residents covered alternative services at 25% of responding institutions, and an additional 68% had a plan in place for responding to personnel shortages. Overall, residents were satisfied with their program's response in a variety of categories. When subdivided based on geographic region, respondents in the Northeast and Northwest were less satisfied with resident wellness, personal and loved ones' safety, and program communication. With the possibility of a &quot;second wave,&quot; successful methods of academic programs adapting to the pandemic should be communicated to reduce the future impact. Increased frequency of communications between program directors and residents can improve mental health and wellness of the resident population.","Steele, Hemal, Browne, Balumuka, Hansen, David","https://doi.org/10.1097/GOX.0000000000003320","20201210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8087,""
"Mental Health Problems in Chinese Healthcare Workers Exposed to Workplace Violence During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study Using Propensity Score Matching Analysis","This study aimed at examining the effect of medical workplace violence (MWV) on the mental health of Chinese healthcare workers during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An anonymous online survey was issued to Chinese healthcare workers (N=1063) from 31 provinces and autonomous regions between February 13th and February 20th. Mental health was measured by the Chinese Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). Medical workplace violence was measured using a single item, whether any type of workplace violence was experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak. Propensity score matching was used to assess the impact of MWV on mental health. Out of 1063, 217 (20.4%) reported experiencing MWV during the COVID-19 outbreak. Before matching, MWV was correlated with elevated mental health problems (b=8.248, p&lt;0.001), after adjusting for other variables. After matching, Chinese healthcare workers who experienced MWV were more likely to suffer from mental health problems than those who did not. MWV exerts a detrimental effect on mental health among Chinese healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. It is necessary to create a more supportive and safer work environment for healthcare workers at this special context of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Wang, Lu, Kelifa, Yu, He, Cao, Zheng, Yan, Yang","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S279170","20201210","COVID-19; mental health; propensity score; workplace violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8088,""
"Depression is Associated with Moderate-Intensity Physical Activity Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Differs by Activity Level, Gender and Gender Role","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and associated restrictive measures have implications for depressive symptoms (henceforth depression) of young people and risk may be associated with their reduced physical activity (PA) level. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and PA among college students with different gender and gender role (masculinity traits and femininity traits) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study included 628 healthy college students from nineteen different locations. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scales (CES-D), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and the 50-item Chinese Sex-Role Inventory (CSRI-50) were used to measure depressive symptoms, PA continuous (weekly metabolic equivalent minutes, MET-minutes/week) and categorical indicators (activity level category) and gender role, respectively. The statistical analyses were used in partial correlation analysis, <i>t</i>-test, one-way ANOVA, moderation model tests, and linear regression model tests. Total of 34.72% participants had clinically relevant depression (16, CES-D scale). Total of 58.6% participants were classified as a &quot;low&quot; activity level for spending less time on PA. Depression significantly negatively correlated with MET-minutes/week in moderate-intensity PA but not vigorous and walking scores. Of note, the depression-PA association was only moderated by the &quot;low&quot; activity level group in terms of categorical scores across gender groups. Participants with higher masculinity traits were less likely to have depression among all participants. Moreover, more recovered cases and fewer deaths could also predict the lower depression risk in the &quot;high&quot; activity level group. Moderate-intensity PA is beneficial for reducing depression risk among college students at a low activity level. College students with fewer masculinity traits (regardless of gender) are highly vulnerable to depression during the outbreak of COVID-19. Effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic seems critical to alleviating the burden of mental disorders of the public including depression.","Lin, Guo, Becker, Yu, Chen, Brendon, Hossain, Cunha, Soares, Veronese, Yu, Grabovac, Smith, Yeung, Zou, Li","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S277435","20201210","COVID-19; depression; femininity; gender; masculinity; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8089,""
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Precautionary Measures Towards COVID-19 Among Medical Visitors at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital Northwest Ethiopia","Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was designated a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. COVID-19 has no effective treatment; nonetheless, early recognition of the disease and applying prevention strategies will help to mitigate the virus propagation. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and precautionary measures of medical center visitors at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 15 to August 15, 2020. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected by using a pre-tested structured, self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. To explain the study variables, frequency tables, figures, and percentages were used. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to see the association between independent and dependent variables. The prevalence of poor knowledge, attitude, and precautionary measures was 42.2%, 39%, and 41.6%, respectively. Being female (AOR=2.79, 95% CI=1.752-4.44), divorced (AOR=0.29, 95% CI=0.09-0.88), and residing in a rural location (AOR=1.93, 95% CI=1.07-3.26) were significantly associated with poor knowledge.

"Longitudinal increases in childhood depression symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown","There has been widespread concern that so-called lockdown measures, including social distancing and school closures, could negatively impact children's mental health. However, there has been little direct evidence of any association due to the paucity of longitudinal studies reporting mental health before and during the lockdown. This present study provides the first longitudinal examination of changes in childhood mental health, a key component of an urgently needed evidence base that can inform policy and practice surrounding the continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health assessments on 168 children (aged 7.6-11.6 years) were taken before and during the UK lockdown (April-June 2020). Assessments included self-reports, caregiver reports, and teacher reports. Mean mental health scores before and during the UK lockdown were compared using mixed linear models. A significant increase in depression symptoms during the UK lockdown was observed, as measured by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) short form. CIs suggest a medium-to-large effect size. There were no significant changes in the RCADS anxiety subscale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional problems subscale. During the UK lockdown, children's depression symptoms have increased substantially, relative to before lockdown. The scale of this effect has direct relevance for the continuation of different elements of lockdown policy, such as complete or partial school closures. This early evidence for the direct impact of lockdown must now be combined with larger scale epidemiological studies that establish which children are most at risk and tracks their future recovery.","Bignardi, Dalmaijer, Anwyl-Irvine, Smith, Siugzdaite, Uh, Astle","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-320372","20201210","adolescent health; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8091,""
"Mental health and well-being of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: contrasting guidelines with experiences in practice","Substantial evidence has highlighted the importance of considering the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several organisations have issued guidelines with recommendations. However, the definition of well-being and the evidence base behind such guidelines remain unclear. The aims of the study are to assess the applicability of well-being guidelines in practice, identify unaddressed healthcare workers' needs and provide recommendations for supporting front-line staff during the current and future pandemics. This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with front-line healthcare workers in the UK (n = 33), and examines them in relation to a rapid review of well-being guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 14). The guidelines placed greater emphasis on individual mental health and psychological support, whereas healthcare workers placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, responsibilities outside the hospital and the invaluable support of the community. The well-being support interventions proposed in the guidelines did not always respond to the lived experiences of staff, as some reported not being able to participate in these interventions because of understaffing, exhaustion or clashing schedules. Healthcare workers expressed well-being needs that aligned with socio-ecological conceptualisations of well-being related to quality of life. This approach to well-being has been highlighted in literature on support of healthcare workers in previous health emergencies, but it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Well-being guidelines should explore the needs of healthcare workers, and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Vera San Juan, Aceituno, Djellouli, Sumray, Regenold, Syversen, Mulcahy Symmons, Dowrick, Mitchinson, Singleton, Vindrola-Padros","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.148","20201210","COVID-19; healthcare workers; qualitative research; rapid review; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8092,""

General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used. There were 1775 participants (Ya'an in 2019 and 2020: 537 respectively; Jingzhou in 2020: 701). Participants in Ya'an had a significantly higher rate of general health problems (GHQ scores Ã¢Â©Â¾3) in 2020 (14.7%) than in 2019 (5.2%) (p &lt; 0.001). Compared with Ya'an (8.0%), participants in Jingzhou in 2020 had a significantly higher rate of anxiety (SAS scores Ã¢Â©Â¾50, 24.1%) (p &lt; 0.001). Participants in Ya'an in 2020 had a significantly higher rate of depression (SDS scores Ã¢Â©Â¾53, 55.3%) than in Jingzhou (16.3%) (p &lt; 0.001). The risk factors of anxiety symptoms included female, number of family members (Ã¢Â©Â¾6 persons), and frequent outdoor activities. The risk factors of depression symptoms included participants in Ya'an and uptake self-protective measures.

"Self-reported psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nepal: findings from an online survey","A lower respiratory tract infection caused by novel coronavirus termed as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) was first identified in China and subsequently took the form of pandemic. Studies on disease outbreak in the past and recent COVID-19 outbreak have demonstrated increased psychological distress and adverse impacts on mental health and psychological wellbeing of people. However, the impact of COVID-19 on psychological wellbeing of people in Nepal hasn't been studied adequately. So, this paper aims to report the findings from a social media survey on psychological impacts of COVID-19 in Nepal. Data were collected through social media from 2082 Nepalese respondents between 23rd April, 2020 and 3rd May, 2020. A total of 2014 respondents who were currently residing in Nepal were included in the analysis. The study suggested that half of the respondents suffered from at least one symptom of psychological distress whereas 32% suffered from two or more symptoms of psychological distress such as restlessness, fearfulness, anxiety and worry and sadness in the past 2Ã‚Â weeks preceding the survey date. The findings further suggested that respondents having lower family income, residing in rented room, and participants from province 2 were more likely to suffer from both single and multiple symptoms of psychological distress. The study has shown high prevalence of psychological distress amongst the Nepalese respondents following COVID-19 outbreak. Appropriate mental health and psychosocial support response needs to be instituted to adequately respond to psychological impacts of the epidemic.","Gautam, Adhikari, Gupta, Shrestha, Koirala, Koirala","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-020-00497-z","20201210","Coronavirus; Nepal; Perceived psychological distress; Social media; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8094,""
"Effectiveness of using a meditation app in reducing anxiety and improving well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","This interventional study will investigate the effect of daily use of a mindfulness app on measures of participant anxiety, well-being, and perceived outlook during the COVID-19 pandemic, by comparing pre-intervention survey responses to post-intervention survey responses. Randomized, controlled trial with parallel assignment. Adults will be assigned either to daily use of a meditation app for 30 days or to a control group (no usage of meditation app) with a 1:1 equivalence allocation ratio. Inclusion Criteria: Participants must be 18 or older, have a smartphone, able to download apps to their smartphone, must be fluent in the English language, able to complete surveys on their own, and must be in the United States for the duration of the study. Current regular use of a mindfulness or meditation app, regular practice of mindfulness or meditation, regular therapy sessions, inability to complete surveys independently, or any mental health restrictions that would prevent participation. All data will be collected through the Insight Timer Meditation App and Google Forms. This trial is being conducted through the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine in Erie, PA, with all data collected digitally. Intervention: Participants will be sent a link to a pre-intervention survey prior to first use of the mindfulness app. Participants will be instructed to use the Insight Timer app for 10 minutes daily for 30 days. At the end of the 30-day intervention period, participants will be sent a link for the post-intervention survey. Two months after the conclusion of the 30-day intervention period, participants will be sent a link for another post-intervention survey. Comparator: Participants will receive the same surveys, but will not use any mindfulness app for the 30-day intervention period. After this 30-day period, participants are invited to use the Insight Timer app if they so choose. The main outcomes are (1) anxiety as assessed by survey questions adapted from the GAD7, comparing pre-intervention to post-30-days of app usage and (2) well-being as assessed by survey questions adapted from the WHO-5, comparing pre-intervention and post-30-days of app usage. Participants will be allocated to interventions via a block random sequence generator with a 1:1 allocation ratio in blocks of 8. No masking is being used in this study (open label). Approximately 75 participants will be randomized to each group, with an estimated enrollment of 150 participants. This study is protocol version number 27-126 and was approved on May 10, 2020.

"Telemental Health Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Virtualization of Outpatient Care Now as a Pathway to the Future","The use of telemental health (TMH) has fostered the continued provision of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ultimately prevented the significant drop in clinical visits as experienced by other health care disciplines. Many health care providers and systems rapidly virtualized care to include visits occurring in what previously were defined as nontraditional locations such as provider and patient homes. Emerging data and reports suggest that this rapid virtualization of mental health services occurred safely and effectively. Although it is uncertain how long the full virtualization will remain, we envision a future wherein mental health services are delivered using a hybrid in-person/TMH approach. This opinion provides an overview of current lessons learned from rapid virtualization due to COVID-19 mitigation strategies and recommends that mental health providers and systems use these lessons to define and promote hybrid care delivery.","Mishkind, Shore, Schneck","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0303","20201210","behavioral health; psychology; telehealth; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8096,""
"COVID-19 as Cause versus Trigger for the Collapse of Capitalism","According to the official narrative of COVID-19, the pandemic has caused the global capitalist economy to collapse, or at least to enter a deep recession and possibly a great depression. Assigning blame to a virus takes attention away from the structural contradictions and instabilities of capitalism that would have led to a crash in any case. This narrative also helps justify non-evidence-based public health policies, including lockdowns, travel bans, closed schools and factories, and forced quarantines of large populations rather than individuals and clustered groups who harbor the infection. Advantages of such drastic measures happen primarily in countries that did not prepare adequately, that did not respond quickly enough with more focused measures to test and isolate people infected with the virus, and that have health care systems either organized by capitalist principles or suffering cutbacks and privatization as a result of capitalist economic ideologies, such as austerity. Authoritarian tactics purportedly intended to protect public health pave the way to antidemocratic rule, militarism, and fascism. These harsh policies also exert their most adverse effects on poor, minority, incarcerated, immigrant, and otherwise marginalized populations, who already suffer from the worsening economic inequality that global, financialized capitalism has fostered.","Waitzkin","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420977711","20201210","COVID-19; capitalism; economics; global economy; ideology; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8097,""
"Life in 90 words: opportunities for person-centred care amidst COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 and the consequent public health and social distancing measures significantly impacted on service continuity for mental health patients. This article reports on contingency planning initiative in the Australian public sector. Ninety-word care synopses were developed for each patient. These formed the basis for guided conversations between case managers and consultant psychiatrists to ensure safe service provision and retain a person-centred focus amidst the threat of major staffing shortfalls. This process identified vulnerable patient groups with specific communication needs and those most at risk through service contraction. The challenges and opportunities for promoting safety and self-management through proactive telehealth came up repeatedly. The guided conversations also raised awareness of the shared experience between patients and professionals of coronavirus disease 2019. There is a parallel pandemic of anxiety which creates a unique opportunity to connect at a human level.","Theodoros, Wyder, Lombardo, Dark, Joseph, Locke, Kinsella, Kar Ray","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220975280","20201210","COVID-19; care synopses; contingency planning; guided conversations; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8098,""

"Investigating changes in noise pollution due to the COVID-19 lockdown: The case of Dublin, Ireland","Noise pollution is considered to be the third most hazardous pollution after air and water pollution by the World Health Organization (WHO). Short as well as long-term exposure to noise pollution has several adverse effects on humans, ranging from psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, hypertension, hormonal dysfunction, and blood pressure rise leading to cardiovascular disease. One of the major sources of noise pollution is road traffic and the WHO reports that around 40 % of Europeâ€™s population are currently exposed to high noise/sound levels. This study investigates sound levels in Dublin, Ireland before and after the lockdown imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis was performed using measured hourly data from 12 noise monitoring stations between January and May, 2020. More than 80 % of the stations recorded high sound levels for more that 60 % of the time before the lockdown in Dublin. However, a significant reduction in hourly average equivalent sound and hourly minimum sound levels was observed at all stations during the lockdown period and this can be attributed to reductions in both road and air traffic movements.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102597","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8101,""
"Optimism, Mindfulness, and Resilience as Potential Protective Factors for the Mental Health Consequences of Fear of the Coronavirus","The COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on mental health. Prior reports have shown that depression, anxiety, and stress have increased throughout the pandemic. Nonetheless, not everyone is affected by these negative consequences and some people may be relatively unaffected. In this online study in a predominantly Dutch and Belgian sample (N = 546), we investigated whether positive personality traits such as optimism, mindfulness, and resilience may protect against the negative mental health consequences (i.e., fear of the coronavirus, depression, stress, and anxiety) of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that fear of COVID-19 was related to higher depression, stress, and anxiety. However, for participants scoring high on mindfulness, optimism, and resilience, this relationship was weakened. In addition to these findings, we present the results of network analyses to explore the network structure between these constructs. These results help to identify individuals whose mental health is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lisa M. W.

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis is higher among young Swiss men with a lower socioeconomic status: evidence from a cohort study","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic affected daily life worldwide. In addition to its tangible physical impacts, it may also have affected those who had been especially vulnerable already before the crisis and those who experienced substantial changes to their work situation during it. The present study aimed to investigate whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis varied with regards to young Swiss menâ€™s pre-crisis level of education and socioeconomic status and to changes in their work situation due to it. Methods A cohort of 2345 young Swiss men (mean age = 29) completed survey-based assessments shortly before (April 2019 to February 2020) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (May to June 2020). Outcomes measured were psychological outcomes before and during the COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and the fear, isolation and psychological trauma induced by it. We investigated associations between these outcomes and their predictors: pre-crisis socioeconomic status (relative financial status and difficulty paying bills) and level of education, changes in work situation during the crisis (job loss, partial unemployment, working from home, change in workload) and working in contact with potentially infected people, both inside and outside the healthcare sector. Results COVID-19 changed the employment status of about 21% of participants (job loss, partial unemployment or lost money if self-employed). More than 40% worked predominantly from home during the crisis. Participants with a lower socioeconomic status experienced higher psychological impact (depression, perceived stress, sleep quality, psychological trauma, fear and isolation) due to the COVID-19 crisis. A higher impact was also felt by participants who lost their job due to the COVID-19 crisis, the partially unemployed, those with an increased workload or those who worked mainly from home. Overall, working in contact with potentially infected people was not associated with psychological impact. Conclusions Even in a country like Switzerland, with relatively high social security benefits and universal healthcare, the COVID-19 crisis had a considerable psychological impact, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status and those who experienced deteriorations in their work situation due to the COVID-19 crisis. Supporting these populations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of inequalities in mental health and social status. Such support could help to lower the overall impact of the crisis on the mental well-being of Switzerlandâ€™s population.","Simon Marmet et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46031-05A-333","20201211","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; education; mental health; switzerland; essential workers; socioeconomic status; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8103,""
"Emotions, reasoning, and mental health as predictors of behavior during three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has required people worldwide to adjust their behavior for several months in response to a crisis of rare proportions. Little is known about the specific factors that affected the progression of the publicâ€™s reactions during the pandemic. Individual factors associated with pandemic-related behavior in general, and compliance with public health measures in particular, are not firmly established. We undertook a survey of behavior, emotions, reasoning style, and mental health in the province of Quebec at the beginning, the peak, and the aftermath of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 530 responders from a convenience sample; 154 responders participated in all three surveys. Emotions were most intense at the beginning of the first wave of the pandemic, not at its peak. Respondersâ€™ compliance with three public health measures decreased between the peak and the aftermath of the first wave of the pandemic; however, mask wearing also became more common. Pandemic-related behavior in general, and compliance with public health measures specifically, were predicted by avoidance-related emotions evoked by the pandemic. Approach-related emotions linked to the societal response contributed specifically to the prediction of compliance with public health measures. In contrast, reasoning style and mental health did not as consistently predict behavior during the pandemic. Our research may help inform public health policy during other waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and future global health crises.","Yanick Leblanc-Sirois et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46154-9DD-87D","20201210","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; mental health; covid-19; reasoning; emotions","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8104,""
"Predictors and patterns of gambling behaviour across the COVID-19 lockdown: findings from a UK cohort study","The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy is well documented, with widespread furloughs, job loss, and financial insecurity. Concerns have been raised about increases in maladaptive coping behaviours such as gambling, to offset financial losses. Similarly, as individuals spend increased time at home, new populations may initiate or increase the frequency of gambling behaviours. The current study used a large longitudinal study of UK adults (N = 32,559) to examine a range of sociodemographic, stress, and health predictors of (i) gambling during strict lockdown (March to the first week of June 2020), (ii) gambling more frequently during strict lockdown compared to before lockdown, and (iii) continued increased rates of gambling during the relaxing of lockdown restrictions (end of July/early August 2020) compared to earlier in the lockdown (late May/early June 2020). Results from a logistic regression indicated that males, older ages, the employed, those with progressively lower levels of education, who lived in overcrowded accommodation, were highly bored, frequently drank alcohol, smoked or were ex-smokers, and had high risk-taking tendencies were more likely to gamble during strict lockdown. Individuals who were more likely to have increased their frequency of gambling during strict lockdown compared to before the lockdown were highly bored, employed, frequently drank alcohol, and had depression and anxiety, whilst men and current smokers were less likely. As lockdown restrictions eased, individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds, who were current smokers, and with lower education attainment were more likely to continue gambling at heightened rates. This suggests which risk groups should be targeted and provided with more effective coping strategies.","Meg Fluharty et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EC-E56-213","20201210","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; covid-19; lockdown; gambling; coping; risk behaviours","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-11","",8105,""
