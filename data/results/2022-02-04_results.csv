"Secondary Qualitative Analysis of Moral Injury in Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses","To investigate the presence of symptoms of moral injury in obstetric and neonatal nurses. A secondary qualitative analysis using an analytic expansion of three primary studies. Postal mail and electronic surveys. I used three primary studies: participants in the first consisted of 78 labor and delivery nurses, participants in the second consisted of 75 nurse-midwives, and participants in the third consisted of 22 NICU nurses. I used Krippendorff's content analysis method for qualitative data to reanalyze the three primary data sets. The categories I used in this analysis were the 10 symptoms of moral injury that are assessed by the Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professionals Version. When combining the three types of obstetric and neonatal participants, the top three most frequently cited symptoms of moral injury were moral concern, guilt, and self-condemnation. For participants in labor and delivery units and NICUs, moral concern was the most often described symptom, whereas for participants in midwifery it was guilt. None of the participants reported loss of meaning in their lives, loss of faith, or religious struggle. Participants who worked in NICUs did not describe any symptoms of shame or difficulty forgiving. In addition to the primary symptoms of moral injury, reported secondary consequences of moral injury can include depression, anxiety, anger, self-harm, and social problems. Interventions such as acceptance and commitment therapy are needed to help nurses address the potential for moral injury and repair its effects. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever, moral injury needs to be recognized in obstetric and neonatal nurses and not just in the military population.","Beck","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogn.2021.12.003","20220203","moral injury; nurses; qualitative; secondary analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26452,""
"Impact of face masks and sunglasses on emotion recognition in South Koreans","Due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, wearing masks has become essential for social interaction, disturbing emotion recognition in daily life. In the present study, a total of 39 Korean participants (female = 20, mean age = 24.2 years) inferred seven emotions (happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, surprise, and neutral) from uncovered, mask-covered, sunglasses-covered faces. The recognition rates were the lowest under mask conditions, followed by the sunglasses and uncovered conditions. In identifying emotions, different emotion types were associated with different areas of the face. Specifically, the mouth was the most critical area for happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, and anger recognition, but fear was most recognized from the eyes. By simultaneously comparing faces with different parts covered, we were able to more accurately examine the impact of different facial areas on emotion recognition. We discuss the potential cultural differences and the ways in which individuals can cope with communication in which facial expressions are paramount.","Kim, Seong, Hong, Choi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263466","20220203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26453,""
"Nursing care recommendation for pediatric COVID-19 patients in the hospital setting: A brief scoping review","The hospitalization of children during the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their physical and mental health. Pediatric nurses have faced challenges in providing high-quality nursing care for children and their families. However, the pediatric nursing care recommendations for COVID-19 patients in the hospital setting remain unclear. The current scoping review provides recommendations for nursing interventions for pediatric COVID-19 patients in the hospital setting. The selected articles containing management and nursing recommendations for COVID-19 that have occurred in pediatric patients ages 0-19 years old. A search strategy was developed and implemented in seven databases. We included peer-reviewed articles that reported observational or interventional studies, as well as policy papers, guides or guidelines, letters and editorials, and web articles. A total of 134 articles and other documents relevant to this review were included. We categorized the results based on The Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC) taxonomy which consists of six domains (e.g., Physiological: Basic); eleven classes (e.g., Nutrition Support); and eighteen intervention themes (e.g., Positioning, Family Presence Facilitation, Family Support, and Discharge Planning). Apart from the intervention of physical problems, there is a need to promote patient- and family-centered care, play therapy, and discharge planning to help children and families cope with their new situation.","Efendi, Hasan, Natalia, Utami, Sonko, Asmarini, Yuningsih, Wanda, Sari","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263267","20220203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26454,""
"Psychosis risk among pregnant women in Ghana","Psychotic illness, although is rare, has been reported in the perinatal period. Individuals diagnosed with psychotic illness tend to first exhibit psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), defined as subclinical psychotic symptoms that occur outside the context of sleep or drug use. However, there is a paucity of empirical data on PLEs in pregnancy to advance scholarly discourse and support professional practice. The current study investigated the prevalence and correlates of PLEs among pregnant women in Ghana, a West African state. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from 702 pregnant women who responded to measures of PLEs, COVID-19 concerns and behavioral maladies such as anxiety and depressive symptoms. Descriptive and inferential statistics, namely chi square, exploratory factor analysis, MANOVA and multinomial logistic regression were used to analyze the data. The results showed that 54.2%, 27.3% and 18.5% of participants were at no/low, moderate and high risk for psychosis, respectively. A total of 44.4% participants were not distressed by PLEs, whereas 32.2% and 23.4% were a bit/quite and very distressed, respectively. Psychosis risk was elevated among pregnant women who were more concerned about the COVID-19 effects, scored high in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and sleep difficulties. The study showed that psychosis risk is present in pregnancy. Screening for psychosis risk in pregnancy should be prioritized for pregnant women with behavioral maladies, including suicidal tendencies, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulties and heightened concerns about COVID-19.","Adjorlolo, Mensah, Badzi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263011","20220203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26455,""
"Negative COVID-19 impacts and depressive symptoms over time among first-year college students","<b>Objective:</b> This study examined the disruptions to social life, financial impact, and academic concerns caused by COVID-19 experienced by first-year college students, as well as their associations with depressive symptoms over time. <b>Participants and Methods:</b> Five hundred and thirty freshman college students completed an online survey at baseline and 14-week follow-up. <b>Results:</b> We found that female students reported greater COVID-19 academic concerns than males. Black students endorsed lower COVID-19 academic concerns and Latinx students reported greater negative COVID-19 financial impact compared to other ethnic groups. First-generation college students reported greater negative COVID-19 financial impact than domestic students. COVID-19 academic concerns and negative social and financial impacts were associated with greater depressive symptoms at baseline. However, only COVID-19 academic concerns were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms over time. <b>Conclusions:</b> Findings suggest that the academic, social, and financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have negative mental health consequences that should be addressed in research and university settings.","Monte, Ang, Tsai","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2032085","20220203","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; first-year college students; intersectionality; mental health; sociodemographic identities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26456,""
"Assessing clinical impacts and attitudes related to COVID-19 among residential substance use disorder patients","<i>Background</i>: Individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) may be particularly at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine attitudes to the pandemic among individuals with SUD. <i>Methods</i>: Survey responses from 266 patients entering a residential treatment program were analyzed. <i>Results</i>: Most participants were White or African American men. A third of participants reported that their substance use had increased during the pandemic (38%), and that they had stockpiled substances because of concerns about supply (30%). A majority of participants indicated more depression (60%), anxiety (61%), worry about finances (62%), and feeling worse about their substance use due to COVID-19 (67%). An exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors that measured interest in SUD treatment, psychological symptoms, adherence to health recommendations, perceptions of vulnerability to COVID-19, and substance use during COVID-19. African American participants indicated a greater interest in treatment than Whites, while White participants indicated increased symptoms and substance use during COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Further, African Americans were more likely to have known someone who had developed COVID-19 than whites (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Older participants indicated adhering to health recommendations more than younger participants, using substances less than younger participants, as well as feeling more vulnerable to COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). <i>Conclusions</i>: This is the first study to examine patient attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 at a residential SUD treatment program. Treatment providers should be aware of patient attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 paying special attention to barriers to treatment engagement.","Wildberger, Wenzel, Fishman","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2021.2010249","20220203","COVID-19; patient attitudes; substance use treatment; treatment engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26457,""
"Food Insecurity and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Cystic Fibrosis Households","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted many households due to shelter-in-place orders and economic hardship. People with cystic fibrosis (CF) experienced increased food insecurity compared to the general population before the pandemic, even though adequate food access is needed to maintain nutrition goals associated with improved health-related outcomes. Little is known about the impact the pandemic had on the food insecurity of people with CF and their families. To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted food insecurity, mental health, and self-care in people with CF. Adults with CF and parents/guardians of children with CF were recruited via social media to complete online questionnaires from May 2020 to February 2021. Questionnaires in English and Spanish included USDA 2-question food insecurity screening, PHQ-4 for mental health screening, and directed questions on the impact of the pandemic. Of 372 respondents, 21.8% of the households experienced food insecurity during the pandemic compared to 18.8% pre-pandemic (p&lt;0.001). More food insecure patients with CF reported weight loss (32.1% vs. 13.1%, p&lt;0.001), worse airway clearance adherence (13.6% vs 5.8%, p&lt;0.01), and worse medication adherence (12.4% vs 1.7%, p&lt;0.01) compared to food secure patients. Food insecure subjects were more likely to have an abnormal mental health screen compared to food secure subjects (53.1% vs. 16.2%, p&lt;0.001). Food insecurity increased in the CF population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Food insecure subjects reported worse mental health and self-care during the pandemic compared to food secure subjects.

"The first wave of COVID-19 and concurrent social restrictions were not associated with a negative impact on mental health and psychiatric well-being","The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to contain it have substantially affected the daily lives of most of the world's population. We describe the impact of the first COVID-19 wave and associated social restrictions on the mental health of a large adult population. We performed a cohort study nested in a prospective randomised clinical trial, comparing responses during the first COVID-19 wave to previous responses. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) of the population moving up one severity category on validated instruments used to measure stress (PSS-10), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and satisfaction with life (SWLS). Responses were linked to inpatient and outpatient ICD-10 codes from registries. Models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and pre-existing diagnoses of mental illness. Of 63,848 invited participants 42,253 (66%) responded. The median age was 60 (IQR 53-68) and 19,032 (45%) were male. Responses during the first wave of COVID-19 did not suggest increased stress (OR 0Ã‚Â·97, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·93 to 1Ã‚Â·01, p = 0Ã‚Â·28), or anxiety (OR 1Ã‚Â·01, 0Ã‚Â·96 to 1Ã‚Â·05, p = 0Ã‚Â·61), but were associated with decreased depression (OR 0Ã‚Â·89, 0Ã‚Â·85 to 0Ã‚Â·93, p &lt; 0Ã‚Â·0001) and increased satisfaction with life (OR 1Ã‚Â·12, 1Ã‚Â·08 to 1Ã‚Â·16, p &lt; 0Ã‚Â·0001). A secondary analysis of repeated measures data showed similar results. Social restrictions were sufficient to contain the pandemic but did not negatively impact validated measures of mental illness or psychiatric well-being. However, responses to individual questions showed signs of fear and stress. This may represent a normal, rather than pathological, population response to a stressful situation.

"Online learning and child abuse: the COVID-19 pandemic impact on work and school from home in Indonesia","The Indonesian government has made a policy requiring parents and children to work and study from home (WFH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this policy was meant to limit the spread of the virus and its effects, it has caused psychological trauma, increased stress on parents, and raised child abuse. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the issue of child abuse during online learning, its underlying factors, and its implications on children's mental health. A descriptive qualitative method was used along with a survey technique utilizing Google Forms, involving 317 parents as respondents. The results showed that there was physical, emotional, and verbal child abuse and negligence during online learning. This happened because children were often assumed of neglecting studies and misusing gadgets. Furthermore, the stress levels in parents increased due to the dual role, i.e, working and being teachers at home.","Suyadi, Selvi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08790","20220203","COVID-19; Child abuse; Early childhood; Online learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26460,""
"Pilot Study: Nutritional and Preclinical Safety Investigation of Fermented Hispidin-Enriched <i>Sanghuangporus sanghuang</i> Mycelia: A Promising Functional Food Material to Improve Sleep","Sleep disturbances have been the hallmark of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Studies have shown that once sleep is disrupted, it can lead to psychological and physical health issues which can, in turn, disrupt circadian rhythm and induce further sleep disruption. As consumers are trying to establish healthy routines, nutritional and preclinical safety investigation of fermented hispidin-enriched <i>Sanghuangporus sanghuang</i> mycelia (GKSS) as a novel food material for spontaneous sleep in Sprague-Dawley rats is conducted for the first time. Results showed that the nutritional analysis of GKSS including moisture, ash, crude lipid, crude protein, carbohydrate, and energy were found to be 2.4 Ã‚Â± 0.3%, 8.0 Ã‚Â± 2.5%, 1.7 Ã‚Â± 0.3%, 22.9 Ã‚Â± 1.2%, 65.1 Ã‚Â± 3.1%, and 367.1 Ã‚Â± 10.2 kcal/100 g respectively. In the 28-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study, only Sprague-Dawley male rats receiving 5 g/kg showed a slight decrease in feed consumption at week 3, but no associated clinical signs of toxicity or significant weight loss were observed. Although a significant reduction of the platelet count was found in mid- and high-dose GKSS treated male groups, such changes were noted to be within the normal range and were not correlated with relative spleen weight changes. Hence, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of GKSS was identified to be higher than 5 g/kg in rats. After the safety of GKSS is confirmed, the sleep-promoting effect of GKSS ethanolic extract enriched with hispidin was further assessed. Despite 75 mg/kg of GKSS ethanolic extract does not affect wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep, GKSS ethanolic extract at 150 mg/kg significantly decreased wakefulness and enhanced NREM and REM sleep. Interestingly, such effects seem to be mediated through anti-inflammatory activities via NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings provide the preliminary evidence to studies support the claims suggesting that GKSS contained useful phytochemical hispidin could be considered as and is safe to use as a functional food agent or nutraceutical for relieving sleep problems mediated by Nrf2 pathway, which the results are useful for future clinical pilot study.","Li, Chang, Kuo, Chu, Li, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.788965","20220203","NOAEL; Nrf2; Sanghuangporus sanghuang mycelia; hispidin; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26461,""
"The Role of Self-Care Activities (SASS-14) in Depression (PHQ-9): Evidence From Slovakia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In the ongoing situation, when the world is dominated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the development of self-care programs appears to be insufficient, while their role in mental health may be crucial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the associations between self-care activities and depression in the general Slovak population, but also in its individual gender and age categories. This was achieved by validating the self-care screening instrument, assessing differences, and evaluating the associations using quantile regression analysis. The final research sample consisted of 806 participants [males: 314 (39%), females: 492 (61%)] and data were collected through an online questionnaire from February 12, 2021 to February 23, 2021. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression (ÃŽÂ± = 0.89) and Self-Care Activities Screening Scale (SASS-14) [health consciousness (HC) (ÃŽÂ± = 0.82), nutrition and physical activity (NPA) (ÃŽÂ± = 0.75), sleep quality (SLP) (ÃŽÂ± = 0.82), and interpersonal and intrapersonal coping strategies (IICS) (ÃŽÂ± = 0.58)] were used as screening measures. Mild depressive symptoms were found in 229 participants (28.41%), moderate depressive symptoms in 154 participants (19.11%), moderately severe depressive symptoms in 60 participants (7.44%) and severe depressive symptoms in 43 participants (5.33%). The main findings revealed the fact that individual self-care activities were associated with depression. This supported the idea that well-practiced self-care activities should be an immediate part of an individual's life in order to reduce depressive symptoms. Sleep quality played an important role, while HC indicated the need for increased attention. Other dimensions of self-care also showed significant results that should not be overlooked. In terms of depression, females and younger individuals need targeted interventions. The supportive educational intervention developed based on the self-care theory can help manage and maintain mental health during a stressful period, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Health policy leaders should focus on health-promoting preventive self-care interventions, as the demand for them increases even more during the pandemic.","Gavurova, Popesko, Ivankova, Rigelsky","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.803815","20220203","COVID-19; coping strategies; depression; health consciousness; mental health; nutrition and physical activity; self-care behavior; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26462,""
"Prevalence and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in inpatients with schizophrenia in Wuhan, China","In contrast to many Western countries, China has maintained its large psychiatric hospitals. The prevalence and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in inpatients with schizophrenia (SCZ) are unclear. To assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among inpatients with SCZ and compare the infected to uninfected SCZ patients in a Wuhan psychiatric hospital. We retrospectively collected demographic characteristics and clinical profiles of all SCZ patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan's Youfu Hospital. Among the 504 SCZ patients, 84 had COVID-19, and we randomly sampled 174 who were uninfected as a comparison group. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 in SCZ patients was 16.7%. Among the 84 SCZ patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age was 54 years and 76.2% were male. The most common symptom was fever (82%), and less common symptoms were cough (31%), poor appetite (20%), and fatigue (16%). Compared with SCZ patients without COVID-19, those with COVID-19 were older (<i>P</i> = 0.006) and significantly lighter (<i>P</i> = 0.002), and had more comorbid physical diseases (<i>P</i> = 0.001). Surprisingly, those infected were less likely to be smokers (&lt; 0.001) or to be treated with clozapine (<i>P</i> = 0.03). Further logistic regression showed that smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 5.61], clozapine treated (OR = 2.95), and male (OR = 3.48) patients with relatively fewer comorbid physical diseases (OR = 0.098) were at a lower risk for COVID-19. SCZ patients with COVID-19 presented primarily with fever, but only one-third had a cough, which might otherwise be the most common mode of transmission between individuals. Two unexpected protective factors for COVID-19 among SCZ inpatients are smoking and clozapine treatment.","Sheng, Wang, Wang, Wu, Huo, Wang, Zhou, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i1.140","20220203","Epidemiology; Inpatient; Mental health; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26463,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on deaths from respiratory diseases: Panel data evidence from Chile","The COVID-19 pandemic has relegated pathologies that were previously commonplace to a secondary context. Therefore, it is necessary to study the evolution of these diseases in the presence or absence of COVID-19. The present study had the following objectives: 1. to evaluate the relationship between the COVID-19 epidemic and the possible decrease in death from respiratory disease (DRd) in Chile; and 2. to study the relationships between meteorological variables and severity of COVID-19 with respect to DRd from January 2018 to February 2021. The variable number of DRds in Chile was analyzed considering the monthly records of meteorological variables (temperature, precipitation and humidity) in each region of Chile and the severity of COVID-19 to evaluate the mortality trend before and after the pandemic. For this, different nonobservable heterogeneity models for panel data were used. The variables that affect DRd include the number of deaths from COVID-19, which led to a decrease in DRd (negative effect) when increased, the number of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU), which led to an increase in DRd (positive effect) when increased, and the minimum temperature, which had a negative effect on DRd. These results are supported by the application of panel regression with one-way random-effects models. This study revealed a reduction in the number of DRds other than COVID-19 during the pandemic in Chile. This could be explained by the sanitary measures applied by the Ministry of Health of Chile in relation to mobility restrictions and social distancing, among others. Therefore, DRd decreased in accordance with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic.","BarrÃƒÂ­a-Sandoval, Ferreira, MÃƒÂ©ndez, Toffoletto","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2021.2023939","20220203","Respiratory diseases; SARS-CoV-2; panel data regression analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26464,""
"Hospitalization, interpersonal and personal factors of social anxiety among COVID-19 survivors at the six-month follow-up after hospital treatment: the minority stress model","As a highly infectious disease with human-to-human transmission characteristics, COVID-19Ã‚Â has caused panic in the general public. Those who have recovered from COVID-19 may experience discrimination and internalized stigma. They may be more likely to worry about social interaction and develop social anxiety. This study investigated the associations among hospitalization factors, social/interpersonal factors, personal factors, and social anxiety to reveal the mechanism of social anxiety in COVID-19 survivors. A cross-sectional, multicenter telephone survey was conducted from July to September 2020 in five Chinese cities (i.e. Wuhan, Nanning, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Dongguan); adult COVID-19 survivors were recruited 6 months after they were discharged from the hospital. Linear regressions and path analysis based on the minority stress model were conducted to test the relationships among hospitalization, social/interpersonal factors, personal factors, and social anxiety. The response rate was 74.5% (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 199, 55.3% females). Linear regression analyses showed that various hospitalization, social/interpersonal, and personal factors were statistically significantly associated with social anxiety. Path analysis showed that the proposed model fit the data well (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(df)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.196(3), <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .362, CFIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .999, NNFIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .996, RMSEAÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .018). Internalized stigma fully mediated the association between perceived discrimination/social support and social anxiety, while it partially mediated the association between perceived affiliate stigma and social anxiety. The results suggest that social/interpersonal and personal factors have a stronger association with social anxiety than hospitalization factors and highlight the importance of internalized stigma in understanding the mechanisms of these relationships. Clinical psychologists can refer to these modifiable psychosocial factors to develop efficient interventions for mental health promotion. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Como una enfermedad altamente infecciosa con caracterÃƒÂ­sticas de transmisiÃƒÂ³n de persona a persona, el COVID-19 ha causado pÃƒÂ¡nico en el pÃƒÂºblico en general.

Es mÃƒÂ¡s probable que se preocupen por la interacciÃƒÂ³n social y desarrollen ansiedad social.<b>Objetivos:</b> Este estudio investigÃƒÂ³ las asociaciones entre factores de hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n, factores sociales /interpersonales, factores personales y ansiedad social para revelar el mecanismo de ansiedad social en sobrevivientes de COVID-19.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos:</b> Se realizÃƒÂ³ una encuesta telefÃƒÂ³nica transversal multicentro de julio a septiembre de 2020 en cinco ciudades chinas (es decir, Wuhan, Nanning, Shenzhen, Zhuhai y Dongguan). Se reclutaron sobrevivientes adultos de COVID-19 seis meses despuÃƒÂ©s de ser dados de alta del hospital. Se realizaron regresiones lineales y anÃƒÂ¡lisis de ruta basados en el modelo de estrÃƒÂ©s de minorÃƒÂ­a para probar las relaciones entre la hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n, los factores sociales/interpersonales, los factores personales y la ansiedad social.<b>Resultados:</b> La tasa de respuesta fue del 74,5% (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 199, 55,3% mujeres). Los anÃƒÂ¡lisis de regresiÃƒÂ³n lineal mostraron que varios factores de hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n, sociales/interpersonales y personales se asociaron de manera estadÃƒÂ­sticamente significativa con la ansiedad social. El anÃƒÂ¡lisis de ruta mostrÃƒÂ³ que el modelo propuesto se ajustaba bien a los datos (<i>Ãâ€¡</i> <sup>2</sup> (<sub>df</sub>)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.196 (3), <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .362, CFIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .999, NNFIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .996, RMSEAÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .018). El estigma internalizado mediÃƒÂ³ completamente la asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre discriminaciÃƒÂ³n/apoyo social percibido y ansiedad social, mientras que mediÃƒÂ³ parcialmente la asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre el estigma percibido de afiliados y ansiedad social.<b>Conclusiones:</b> Los resultados sugieren que los factores sociales/interpersonales y personales tienen una asociaciÃƒÂ³n mÃƒÂ¡s fuerte con la ansiedad social que los factores de hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n y resaltan la importancia del estigma internalizado en la comprensiÃƒÂ³n de los mecanismos de estas relaciones. Los psicÃƒÂ³logos clÃƒÂ­nicos pueden referirse a estos factores psicosociales modificables para desarrollar intervenciones eficientes para la promociÃƒÂ³n de la salud mental. <b>Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>: Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§Â§ÂÃ¥â€¦Â·Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¤Â¼Â Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§â€°Â¹Ã¥Â¾ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©Â«ËœÃ¤Â¼Â Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¦â‚¬Â§Ã§â€“Â¾Ã§â€”â€¦, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€¦Â¬Ã¤Â¼â€”Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥Â¼â€¢Ã¨ÂµÂ·Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂÂÃ¦â€¦Å’Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¨Â¿â€¡Ã¨Â¯Â¥Ã§â€“Â¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Â¾â‚¬Ã¥Â¾â‚¬Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Â±Â¡Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å’â€“, Ã§â€Å¡Ã¨â€¡Â³Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã©ÂÂ­Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¦Â­Â§Ã¨Â§â€ , Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã©Â¡Â¾Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ©â„¢â€¦Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã¥Â¾â‚¬, Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨â‚¬Å’Ã¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž:</b> Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Â½ÂÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ , Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ©â„¢â€¦Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â», Ã¦ÂÂ­Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¥â€¡ÂºÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¥Â¹Â¸Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥Â½Â¢Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢:</b> Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã¦Â¨ÂªÃ¦â€“Â­Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã§â€ÂµÃ¨Â¯ÂÃ¨Â®Â¿Ã¨Â°Ë†Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â¢Ã¥Â¼ÂÃ¤ÂºÅ½2020Ã¥Â¹Â´7Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨â€¡Â³9Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¤Âºâ€Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥Å¸Å½Ã¥Â¸â€š (Ã¦Â­Â¦Ã¦Â±â€°, Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Â®Â, Ã¦Â·Â±Ã¥Å“Â³, Ã§ÂÂ Ã¦ÂµÂ·Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸Å“Ã¨Å½Å¾) Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¥Â¹Â¸Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Å¡ÂÃ¨Â®Â¿Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥, Ã¥Â½Â¢Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥Â¤Å¡Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€¹â€ºÃ¥â€¹Å¸Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â±Â¡Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¦Ë†ÂÃ¥Â¹Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¥Â¹Â¸Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¥Â½â€™Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â°â€˜Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â·Â¯Ã¥Â¾â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾Â, Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¤Â½ÂÃ©â„¢Â¢, Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ©â„¢â€¦Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“:</b> Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¨Â®Â¿Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Âºâ€Ã§Â­â€Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº 74.5% (Ã¨Å½Â·Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¤Â¸Âº 199,Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¥Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Â 55.3%) Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§ÂºÂ¿Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã¥Â½â€™Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½, Ã¥Ââ€žÃ§Â§ÂÃ¤Â½ÂÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ©â„¢â€¦Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â·Â¯Ã¥Â¾â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦Â¨Â¡Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¦â€¹Å¸Ã¥ÂË†Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥Â¥Â½ (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(df)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.196(3), <i>p</i>=Ã‚Â .362, CFIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .999, NNFIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .996, RMSEAÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .018) Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€ â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å’â€“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â±Â¡Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Â­Â§Ã¨Â§â€ Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€°Â¿Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¥Âºâ€, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¿Å¾Ã¥Â¸Â¦Ã¦Â±Â¡Ã¥ÂÂÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦â€°Â¿Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã¥Â±â‚¬Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¥Âºâ€Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº:</b> Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½, Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ©â„¢â€¦Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¨Â¨â‚¬Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¤Â½ÂÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤ÂºÂ¤Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¼Âº, Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å’â€“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â±Â¡Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Ââ€ Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â½Â¢Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦ÂÃ¦â‚¬Â§Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥Ë†Â©Ã§â€Â¨Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¥ÂËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¥Ë†Â¶Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ©Â«ËœÃ¦â€¢Ë†Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Å½ÂªÃ¦â€“Â½Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¤Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Ju, Yang, Ma, Wang, Fu, Hu, Luo, Xiao, Zheng, Xu, Fang, Chan, Xu, Chen, He, Zhu, Tang, Huang, Hong, Xiao, Sun, Hao, Cai, Yang, Ye, Chen, Yuan, Wang, Zou","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.2019980","20220203","COVID-19 survivor; China; hospitalization; minority stress; psychosocial factors; social anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26465,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Overall Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals Globally: A Meta-Review of Systematic Reviews","This meta-review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of overall mental health of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a comprehensive literature search on Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE. A predefined eligibility criterion was used to screen the articles. The methodology quality of eligible studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for systematic reviews. The data were narratively synthesised in line with the meta-review aim. Forty systematic reviews (represented as <i>K</i> = 40), which reported data from 1,828 primary studies (<i>N</i>) and 3,245,768 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The findings from a pooled prevalence indicate that anxiety (16-41%, <i>K</i> = 30, <i>N</i> = 701), depression (14-37%, <i>K</i> = 28, <i>N</i> = 584), and stress/post-traumatic stress disorder (18.6-56.5%, <i>K</i> = 24, <i>N</i> = 327) were the most prevailing COVID-19 pandemic-related mental health conditions affecting healthcare workers. Other reported concerns included insomnia, burnout, fear, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatization symptoms, phobia, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts. Considering regions/countries, the highest anxiety was reported in the United-Kingdom [22.3, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):7-38, <i>N</i> = 4] compared to other countries, while the highest depression was in the Middle-East, (41, 95% CI:16-60, <i>N</i> = 5) and stress in the Eastern Mediterranean region (61.6, 95% CI:56.4-66.8, <i>N</i> = 2) compared to other regions. The most significant risk factors include female gender, younger age, being a nurse, and frontline professional. The most-reported coping strategies include individual/group psychological support, family/relative support, training/orientation, and the adequacy of personal protective equipment. It was concluded that healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, allied health) have experienced various mental health issues during COVID-19 pandemic. The meta-review, therefore, recommends targeted interventions and health policies that address specific mental health issues to support health professionals worldwide during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar future health crises. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD4202126200, identifier: CRD42021262001.","Chutiyami, Cheong, Salihu, Bello, Ndwiga, Maharaj, Naidoo, Kolo, Jacob, Chhina, Ku, Devar, Pratitha, Kannan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.804525","20220203","COVID-19; coping strategies; health professional; mental health; reviewÃ¢â‚¬â€œsystematic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26466,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Affect, Fear, and Personality of Primary School Children Measured During the Second Wave of Infections in 2020","In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, a large body of research has identified a negative impact on individuals' affectivity, frequently documented by increased prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms. For children, this research was less extensive, was mainly based on caregivers' reports and neglected personality assessment. In order to measure the impact of the pandemic, and the fears it caused, on primary school children's affect and personality, 323 (180 boys and 143 girls) Italian third, fourth and fifth graders were assessed between October and November 2020, namely during the second wave of COVID-19 infections in Italy, with validated self-reports of affect (Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children, PANAS-C), fear of COVID-19 (Fear of COVID-19 Scale, FCV-19S) and personality (junior Temperament and Character Inventory, jTCI). In comparison with PANAS-C and jTCI normative scores collected prior to the pandemic, data obtained from children in 2020 showed unchanged affect scores in the overall sample, a decrease of Positive Affect in girls, and a decrease in the Harm Avoidance and an increase in the Self-Transcendence scales of personality. Fear of COVID-19 scores were positively correlated with Negative Affect scores and negatively predicted by children's personality profile of resilience (calculated using scores on the Harm Avoidance and the Self-Directedness scales of personality). These results suggested that Italian primary school children, especially boys, maintained their pre-pandemic levels of affect (or restored them after the first COVID-19 wave) and partially diverged from the typical development of personality in an apparently positive sense, namely toward more courageous/optimistic and spiritual profiles. This sort of children's post-traumatic growth might also be attributed to children's family and education systems, which should continue to be supported to promote and maintain community mental health.","Matiz, Fabbro, Paschetto, Urgesi, Ciucci, Baroncelli, Crescentini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.803270","20220203","COVID-19; affect; anxiety; children; depression; mental health; personality; spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26467,""
"Transition age youth mental health: addressing the gap with telemedicine","Transition age youth (TAY), a demographic spanning ages 15-26, navigate a myriad of developmental transitions, ranging from identity formation and intimate relationships to substance use. Unfortunately, many young adults continue to have a dearth of mental health services and programing tailored to their unique developmental needs. Moreover, the systems of care in place are generally designed for treating traditional pediatric and adult patients but not ideally suited to meet the needs of TAY. Given the additional stressors from the COVID-19 pandemic, TAY are now, more than ever, in need of routine mental health care. We posit that the rapid expansion of telemedicine programming developed in response to the pandemic could be beneficial in mitigating this historic gap in care. In this commentary, we call on mental health providers and researchers to expand and invest in the growing number of telemedicine interventions and programming for this population so that TAY can begin to receive the care they so desperately need.","Khetarpal, Auster, Miller, Goldstein","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00444-3","20220203","Adolescent; COVID-19; E-therapy; Health care access; Health care policy; Telemedicine; Transition age youth; Transition to adult services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26468,""

"Trait resilience protects against depression caused by loneliness during the COVID pandemic","We hypothesized that resilience would buffer people from depression caused by loneliness and social isolation during the COVID pandemic. Capitalizing on a unique longitudinal dataset of 447 American adults, we used well established self-report instruments to find that resilience at time 1 buffered individuals against the effects of loneliness at time 2 causing depression at time 3. Effects were robust across age, sex, and education level, and generalized to trait variables we believe are partly constitutive of resilience: conscientiousness, extraversion, and (negatively) neuroticism. However, our results were relatively specific to depression as the outcome, and did not generalize to other adverse outcomes, such as stress and anxiety. Future studies can use the open dataset provided together with the new resilience factors that we propose in order to further test the interventional potential of our findings.","Yanting Han et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0081-10D-3A4","20220204","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid pandemic; depression; personality; anxiety; resilience; loneliness; stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-04","",26471,""
