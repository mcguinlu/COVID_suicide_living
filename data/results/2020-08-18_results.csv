The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. We conducted interview-surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States, to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and wellbeing. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety and depressive thoughts among students. These include fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty of concentrating (89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address mental health of college students.","Son, Hegde, Smith, Wang, Sasangohar","https://doi.org/10.2196/21279","20200817","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3929,""

Nurses lacking access to adequate PPE (24.9%, nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 163) were more likely to report symptoms of depression (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.31, 2.94; pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .001), anxiety (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12, 2.40; pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .01) and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.22, 2.74; pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .003). Healthcare organizations should be aware of the magnitude of mental health problems among nurses and vigilant in providing them with adequate PPE as the pandemic continues.","Arnetz, Goetz, Sudan, Arble, Janisse, Arnetz","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001999","20200817","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3930,""
"Interpersonal violence against people with disabilities: Additional concerns and considerations in the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective/Purpose: The objective of this article is to provide information about the ways in which the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may affect the ongoing public health issue of violence against people with disabilities and how rehabilitation psychologists and other providers can address these concerns in their practice. This article reviews the literature on violence against people with disabilities as well as emerging literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and its social and medical consequences. The COVID-19 pandemic magnifies existing issues and barriers facing people with disabilities who are experiencing interpersonal violence. These issues include reliance on the perpetrator for care and assistance, barriers to reporting abuse and seeking help, fear of retaliation and other negative consequences if abuse is reported, emotional abuse related to disability, and exacerbation of secondary physical and mental health sequalae of abuse. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences enhance the already increased risk for abuse among people with disabilities. Providers who work with individuals with disabilities should address these issues at both the individual client and systems levels.

"Past Epidemics, Natural Disasters, COVID19, and Mental Health: Learning from History as we Deal with the Present and Prepare for the Future","As cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to rise, psychological endurance is a challenge many people will face. For mental health, heightened stress responses to the pandemic, is likely to manifest in three ways: 1) development of a new episode of a disorder in those with a predisposition to a major psychiatric disorder or an acute exacerbation in those who already have such a disorder, 2) development of a trauma or stressor related disorder, such as acute stress disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or adjustment disorders, and 3) development of a symptomatic stress response that does not meet the diagnostic criteria of a psychiatric disorder. The authors reviewed existing literature on past epidemics, natural disasters, and COVID-19 with a focus on psychiatry and mental health. Psychological effects of past epidemics (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-1, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the Anthrax threat), past natural disasters, and current COVID-19 data suggest numerous psychological effects following the pandemic. Alcohol use, PTSD, anxiety, anger, fear of contagion, perceived risk, uncertainty, and distrust are a few of the immediate and long-term effects that are likely to result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying people in need of mental health care and determining the appropriate psychiatric services and therapy needed will be important. Increasing the use and availability of telehealth, group meetings, and online resources are some ways that health care workers can prepare for the increasing demand of psychiatric services during and following the pandemic.","Esterwood, Saeed","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09808-4","20200817","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; Stress response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3932,""
"Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Public in Egypt","This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping among the public in Egypt during the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. An online snowball sampling approach was used to collect data from netizens in four Egyptian governorates between 16 and 30 April 2020. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed to assess sociodemographic characteristics, sleeping hours per day, and psychological disturbances (depression, anxiety, and stress) of participants using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Out of 1629 participants, 48.1% were aged Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã‚Â years, 42.4% were men, and 20.0% were working in the health sector. The participants reported a high prevalence of depression (67.1%: mild to moderate 44.6% and severe to very severe 22.5%), anxiety (53.5%: mild to moderate 30.6% and severe to very severe 22.9%), stress (48.8%: mild to moderate 33.8% and severe to very severe 15.0%), and inadequate sleeping (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°6Ã‚Â h/day) 23.1%. Female sex, working in sectors other than the health sector, watching/reading COVID-19 news Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°2Ã‚Â h/day, and lack of emotional support from family and society were associated with a high prevalence of severe to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress. In conclusion, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on the public in Egypt were enormous, therefore, providing psychological support and counsel is warranted.","Arafa, Mohamed, Saleh, Senosy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00701-9","20200817","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Inadequate sleeping; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3933,""
"Operating room efficiency and timing during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in a referral orthopaedic hospital in Northern Italy","The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affected health care systems at different levels with important consequences on health, economy, and social structures. This paper aims to analyse the impact on surgical block utilisation and efficiency in an orthopaedics reference centre in Northern Italy. The timeframe chosen for the current analysis was April 2020, to be compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Number and type of procedures, first case delay, occupancy rate, and turnover time were used as indicators to benchmark the activities. The overall number of surgical procedures decreased by 57%, from 537 in 2019 to 230 in the same timeframe in 2020. Orthopaedic procedures predominated in 2019, with 434 cases (80.8%), while in 2020, trauma was the leading activity, with 200 cases (86.9%). Orthopaedic surgery had a relative decrement of 93% while trauma has relatively increased by 94%. Mean first case delay in orthopaedic room (OR) was two hours and 36 minutes (SD 01:40:21) in 2020 compared with only 19 minutes (SD 00:02:15) in 2019. OR occupancy rate was 59% in 2020 compared with 89% in 2019. Turnover time raised from 21 minutes in 2019 to 53 min in 2020. These data clearly show the deep impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OR facilities. Efficiency indicators fell dramatically in April 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019. This scenario will deeply affect both the waiting lists and the economic burden of the hospital. Regaining efficiency and maintaining the quality and safety of the process while restoring elective orthopaedic surgery are among the main challenges that surgeons will face in the next time.","Andreata, Faraldi, Bucci, Lombardi, Zagra","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04772-x","20200817","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Efficiency; Operating room; Orthopaedic trauma; Performance indicators","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3934,""
"Lockdown and adolescent mental health: reflections from a child and adolescent psychotherapist","The author, a child and adolescent psychoanalytic psychotherapist working in the UK NHS, ponders the varied impacts of 'lockdown' on adolescents, their parents and the psychotherapists who work with them, during the COVID-19 pandemic. She asks, particularly, how psychological therapies are positioned during such a crisis, and whether the pressures of triage and emergency can leave time and space for sustained emotional and psychological care. She wonders how psychoanalytic time with its sustaining rhythm can be held onto in the face of the need for triage on the one hand and the flight to online and telephone delivery on the other. Above all, the author questions how the apparent suspension of time during lockdown is belied by the onward pressure of adolescent time, and how this can be understood by, and alongside, troubled adolescents.","Catty","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15961.1","20200817","Adolescent mental health; COVID-19 pandemic; deliberate self-harm; psychoanalytic psychotherapy; quarantine; temporality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3935,""
"How the COVID-19 Pandemic is Changing Mental Health Disease Management: The Growing Need of Telecounseling in Italy","Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by coronavirus-2 (CoV-2). The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. Standard public health measures, such as &quot;stay-at-home&quot; orders, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment, are being used to manage the pandemic, and these measures are changing social relationships, including those between doctors and patients. The mental health effects of this confinement can include feelings of isolation and stress-related fear of contamination and death, and psychiatric and/or psychotherapeutic help using telehealth could be beneficial. In Italy, psychological telecounseling has been an effective method of supporting the physical and psychosocial needs of all patients, regardless of their geographical locations. In this commentary, the authors promote the use of telehealth as an effective means of treating patients with mental health issues.","De Luca, CalabrÃƒÂ²","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+is+Changing+Mental+Health+Disease+Management:+The+Growing+Need+of+Telecounseling+in+Italy.","20200817","Covid-19; mental health; psychotherapy; telecounseling; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3936,""
"Design and Implementation of a Regional Inpatient Psychiatry Unit for Patients who are Positive for Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2","Patients with psychiatric illnesses are particularly vulnerable to highly contagious, droplet-spread organisms such as SARS-CoV-2. Patients with mental illnesses may not be able to consistently follow up behavioral prescriptions to avoid contagion, and they are frequently found in settings with close contact and inadequate infection control, such as group homes, homeless shelters, residential rehabilitation centers, and correctional facilities. Furthermore, inpatient psychiatry settings are generally designed as communal spaces, with heavy emphasis on group and milieu therapies. As such, inpatient psychiatry services are vulnerable to rampant spread of contagion. With this in mind, the authors outline the decision process and ultimate design and implementation of a regional inpatient psychiatry unit for patients infected with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and share key points for consideration in implementing future units elsewhere. A major takeaway point of the analysis is the particular expertise of trained experts in psychosomatic medicine for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Angelino, Lyketsos, Ahmed, Potash, Cullen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.018","20200817","consultation-liaison psychiatry; infection control; infectious disease; mental health; respiratory disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3937,""

"Effect of common medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors in kidney tissue","Besides the respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Out of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, while 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups namely the renin-angiotensin inhibitors such as enalapril, antibacterial agents such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, while other medications such as allopurinol suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Alabed, Tayoun, Loney, Uddin, Senok, Al Heialy, Hamoudi, Kashour, Alsheikh-Ali, Hamid, Halwani","https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12862","20200817","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3940,""

"Epilepsy in time of COVID-19 a survey-based study","Collateral damage may occur in epilepsy management during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to establish the impact of this pandemic on epilepsy patients in terms of patient-reported seizure control and emerging symptoms. Cross-sectional study including consecutive patients assessed by telephone contact in an epilepsy clinic during the first month of confinement. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded and a 19-item questionnaire was systematically completed. Data regarding the impact of confinement, economic effects of the pandemic, and subjective perception of telemedicine were recorded. Additional clinical data were obtained in patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Two-hundred and fifty-five patients were recruited: mean age 48.2Ã‚Â±19.8 years, 121 (47.5%) women. An increase in seizure frequency was reported by 25 (9.8%) patients. Sixty-eight (26.7%) patients reported confinement-related anxiety, 22 (8.6%) depression, 31 (12.2%) both, and 72 (28.2%) insomnia. Seventy-three (28.6%) patients reported a reduction in economic income. Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor-related epilepsy etiology [OR=7.36 (95% CI 2.17-24.96)], drug-resistant epilepsy [OR=3.44 (95% CI 1.19-9.95)], insomnia [OR=3.25 (95% CI 1.18-8.96)], fear of epilepsy [OR=3.26 (95% CI 1.09-9.74)], and income reduction [OR=3.65 (95% CI 1.21-10.95)] were associated with a higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Telemedicine was considered satisfactory by 214 (83.9%) patients. Five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with no changes in seizure frequency. The COVID-19 pandemic has effects in epilepsy patients. Patients with tumor-related, drug-resistant epilepsy, insomnia, and economic difficulties are at a higher risk of increased seizure frequency.

"Attitudes and collateral psychological effects of COVID-19 in pregnant women in Colombia","To assess clinical impact, psychological effects, and knowledge of pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak in seven cities in Colombia. Currently, there are uncertainty and concerns about the maternal and fetal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. A cross-sectional web survey was carried out including pregnant women in seven cities in Colombia. Women were evaluated during the mitigation phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic between April 13 and May 18, 2020. The questions evaluated demographic, knowledge, psychological symptoms, and attitudes data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1021 patients were invited to participate, obtaining 946 valid surveys for analysis. The rate of psychological consequences of the pandemic was much larger than the number of patients clinically affected by the virus, with 50.4% of the entire cohort reporting symptoms of anxiety, 49.1% insomnia, and 25% reporting depressive symptoms. Poorly informed women were more likely to be younger, affiliated to the subsidized regime, and with lower levels of education. The knowledge of pregnant women about SARS-CoV-2 infection is far from reality and this seems to be associated with an indirect effect on the concern and psychological stress of pregnant women in Colombia.","Parra-Saavedra, Villa-Villa, PÃƒÂ©rez-Olivo, Guzman-Polania, Galvis-Centurion, Cumplido-Romero, Santacruz-Vargas, Rivera-Moreno, Molina-Giraldo, Guillen-Burgos, Navarro, FlÃƒÂ³rez-Lozano, Barrero-Ortega, Sanz-Cortes, Miranda","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13348","20200817","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Depressive symptoms; Mental health; Pregnancy; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3943,""

"Home confinement during the COVID-19: day-to-day associations of sleep quality with rumination, psychotic-like experiences and somatic symptoms","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, populations from many countries have been confined at home for extended periods of time in stressful environmental and media conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidenced deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies, and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. Focus was set on between-and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. Results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences and somatic complaints during the same day, and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was unidirectional since daytime reports of negative mental experiences were not associated with poor sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement","Peter Simor et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-9FB-D9D","20200807","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; coronavirus; psychotic-like; somatic symptoms; sleep; rumination; stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3946,""

We aimed to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during the COVID-19 outbreak in an international sample and to explore the role of fatalism in behavior modification and psychological distress. Data for the study were collected via an anonymous online survey. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, health status, the impact of COVID-19 on health and behavior, pandemic-related stress, as well as fatalism. Traumatic impact of the pandemic was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The sample included 465 participants from 30 different countries (mean age = 36.87, SD = 13.39, age range = 18 â€“ 76; 80% female). Study participants were significantly affected by the pandemic. While none of the study participants have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 25% knew someone who had received the diagnosis. The overwhelming majority (79%) had to make changes to their daily routine, and 48.82% of the sample reported moderate to severe traumatic impact of the pandemic. Fatalism was found to be a statistically significant predictor of PTSS in a multiple regression model and was also associated with a lack of behavior modification in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event with a potential to affect the mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. Our findings also indicate that public health interventions should take into account the negative impact of fatalism on behavior modification.","Olga Bogolyubova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D","20200818","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; traumatic stress; mental health; covid-19; coronavirus; ptss; posttraumatic stress symptoms; fatalism","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3948,""
"Human-animal relationships and interactions during the Covid-19 lockdown phase in the UK: investigating links with mental health and loneliness","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic raises questions about the role that relationships and interactions between humans and animals play in the context of widespread social distancing and isolation measures. We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal ownersâ€™ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. Results: Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. Conclusion: The human-animal bond is a construct of potential clinical importance to identify mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Animal ownership appeared to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of lockdown. Further targeted investigation of the role of human-animal relationships and interactions for human health, including testing of the social buffering hypothesis and the development of instruments suited for use across animal species, is required.","Elena Ratschen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46105-AA9-2F9","20200803","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; social distancing &amp; mental health; isolation; covid-19; human-animal bond; human-animal interaction","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-18","",3949,""
