"SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE TOXICITY OF SARS-CoV-2-DERIVED PEPTIDE IN NON-TARGET COVID-19 ORGANISMS: A STUDY INVOLVING INBRED AND OUTBRED MICE","Despite advances in research on the vaccine and therapeutic strategies of COVID-19, little attention has been paid to the possible (eco)toxicological impacts of the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 particles in natural environments. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the behavioral and biochemical consequences of the short exposure of outbred and inbred mice (male Swiss and C57Bl/6J mice, respectively) to PSPD-2002 (peptide fragments of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2) synthesized in the laboratory. Our data demonstrated that after 24h of intraperitoneal administration of PSPD-2002 (at 580ÃŽÂ¼g/kg) the animals did not present alterations in their locomotor, anxiolytic-like, or anxiety-like behavior (in the open field test), nor antidepressant-like or depressive behavior in the forced swimming test. However, the C57Bl/6J mice exposed to PSPD-2002 showed memory deficit in the novel object recognition task, which was associated with higher production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, as well as the increased suppression of acetylcholinesterase brain activity, compared to Swiss mice also exposed to peptide fragments. In Swiss mice the reduction in the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the brain was not associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers (hydrogen peroxide), suggesting that other antioxidant mechanisms may have been activated by exposure to PSPD-2002 to maintain the animals' brain redox homeostasis. Finally, the results of all biomarkers evaluated were applied into the ""Integrated Biomarker Response Index"" (IBRv2) and the principal component analysis (PCA), and greater sensitivity of C57Bl/6J mice to PSPD-2002 was revealed. Therefore, our study provides pioneering evidence of mammalian exposure-induced toxicity (non-target SARS-CoV-2 infection) to PSPD-2002, as well as ""sheds light"" on the influence of genetic profile on susceptibility/resistance to the effects of viral peptide fragments.","da Luz, da Costa AraÃƒÂºjo, Rezende, Silva, Charlie-Silva, Braz, Sanches, Rahman, BarcelÃƒÂ³, Malafaia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2022.03.012","20220408","C57Bl/6J mice; Environmental Toxicology; Swiss mice; pandemic COVID-19; proteins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29833,""
"Suicide in India during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","There has been substantial discussion as to whether the mental health and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic might impact suicide rates. Although India accounts for the largest proportion of global suicides, the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates in this country are unknown. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data were used to calculate annual suicide rates for the period 2010-2020, stratified by sex and state. Rate Ratios (RRs) stratified by sex and state were calculated to estimate the extent of change in suicide rates. Suicide rates in India generally showed a decreasing trend from 2010 until 2017, with the trend reversing after this period, particularly for males. Among males and females, the highest increase post 2017 was noted in 2020 (compared to 2017) (males: RRÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.18 95% UI 1.17-1.19; females: RRÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.05 95% UI 1.03-1.06). Suicide rates based on the NCRB data might be an underestimation of the true suicide rates. Suicide rates in India increased during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although the increase in suicide rates, especially among males, predates the pandemic, the increase in suicide rates was highest in 2020, compared to increases in previous years. Further research is warranted to understand the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide in India.","Arya, Page, Spittal, Dandona, Vijayakuma, Munasinghe, John, Gunnell, Pirkis, Armstrong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.03.066","20220408","COVID-19; India; National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB); Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29834,""
"Nature's contributions in coping with a pandemic in the 21st century: A narrative review of evidence during COVID-19","While COVID-19 lockdowns have slowed coronavirus transmission, such structural measures also have unintended consequences on mental and physical health. Growing evidence shows that exposure to the natural environment (e.g., blue-green spaces) can improve human health and wellbeing. In this narrative review, we synthesized the evidence about nature's contributions to health and wellbeing during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the pandemic, people experienced multiple types of nature, including both outdoors and indoors. Frequency of visits to outdoor natural areas (i.e., public parks) depended on lockdown severity and socio-cultural contexts. Other forms of nature exposure, such as spending time in private gardens and viewing outdoor greenery from windows, may have increased. The majority of the evidence suggests nature exposure during COVID-19 pandemic was associated with less depression, anxiety, stress, and more happiness and life satisfaction. Additionally, nature exposure was correlated with less physical inactivity and fewer sleep disturbances. Evidence was mixed regarding associations between nature exposure and COVID-related health outcomes, while nature visits might be associated with greater rates of COVID-19 transmission and mortality when proper social distancing measures were not maintained. Findings on whether nature exposure during lockdowns helped ameliorate health inequities by impacting the health of lower-socioeconomic populations more than their higher-socioeconomic counterparts for example were mixed. Based on these findings, we argue that nature exposure may have buffered the negative mental and behavioral impacts of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recovery and resilience during the current crises and future public health crises might be improved with nature-based infrastructure, interventions, designs, and governance.","Labib, Browning, Rigolon, Helbich, James","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155095","20220408","COVID-19; Coronavirus pandemic; Greenspace; Health; Nature exposure; Nature-based solutions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29835,""
"Challenges and experiences of general practitioners during the course of the Covid-19 pandemic: a northern Italian observational study-cross-sectional analysis and comparison of a two-time survey in primary care","General practitioners (GPs) have been among the frontline workers since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reflecting and analyzing the ongoing pandemic response of general practice provides essential information and serves as a precondition for outlining future health policy strategies. To investigate the effects of the pandemic on GPs' daily work and well-being and to describe needs for improvement in primary care highlighted by the pandemic. A 2-time cross-sectional online survey involving GPs in a northern Italian region was conducted in September 2020 and March/April 2021. Eighty-four GPs (29.6% of invited GPs) participated in the first survey, and 41 GPs (14.4%) in the second survey. Most GPs experienced a notable workload increase which was tendentially higher during the advanced stages of the pandemic. A notable increase between the first and the second survey was noted regarding the frequency of Covid-related patient contacts and phone calls. Communication with health authorities and hospitals was rated as improvable. Psychological distress among GPs tended to increase over time; female GPs were more affected in the first survey. Most practices introduced major changes in their workflow, mainly appointment-based visits and separating Covid-19-suspected patients. Availability of protective equipment considerably increased over time. In the second survey, the GPs felt more prepared to self-protection and outpatient treatment of Covid-affected patients. The work of GPs has been substantially impacted by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Efforts should be undertaken to efficiently strengthen primary care which plays an important role in pandemic events. The Covid-19 pandemic has considerably impacted the way of daily working of general practitioners (GPs). Several studies have been conducted which reflected the immediate response of general practice to the pandemic at its early stages, but studies assessing the ongoing situation are missing. This study responded to this need and aimed to illustrate the challenges, difficulties, and the personal well-being of GPs during the first pandemic wave and during the second/third pandemic wave. The study consisted of a 2-time online survey of GPs in a northern Italian province. The 84 GPs participating in the first survey and 41 GPs participating in the second survey indicated a notable workload increase due to the pandemic. The availability of protective equipment and of clinical guidance about how to treat Covid-19-affected patients in their homes was poor at the beginning but increased considerably over time. Psychological distress was slightly increasing. Most GPs modified their workflow and practice organization. Adequate support for general practice is required in pandemic events to enable GPs to provide safe and high-quality care; needs for improvement especially concern the provision of resources and the communication with public health institutions and hospitals.","Mahlknecht, Barbieri, Engl, Piccoliori, Wiedermann","https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmac025","20220408","Covid-19; cross-sectional survey; general practice; mental health; primary care physicians; workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29836,""
"Evaluating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Postpartum Depression","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Studies examining the impact of natural disasters noted that in the setting of stable rates of depression, postpartum depression (PPD) increased in vulnerable subgroups. COVID-19 may similarly impact maternal health. This study aimed to characterize the effect of COVID-19 on the incidence of PPD and to identify vulnerable subgroups. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Retrospective chart review of maternal-newborn dyads was conducted over two epochs: pre-COVID-19 (January 1-June 1, 2019) and during-COVID-19 (January 1-June 1, 2020). PPD was defined as an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of Ã¢â€°Â§ 10 at any postnatal appointment. Prevalence of depression and anxiety was recorded. Data were analyzed using chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and <i>t</i>-tests. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Among 1061 dyads (557 in the 2019 epoch, 504 in the 2020 epoch), the epochs had similar clinical and demographic characteristics. Incidence proportion of PPD was similar (16.9% to 18.1%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.67). In subgroup analyses, this outcome was also similar among primiparous mothers (17.4% to 22.2%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22) and publicly insured mothers (23.9% to 25.9%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.78). The 2020 epoch exhibited higher prevalence of current depression (9.9% to 14.3%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03) and anxiety (10.1% to 18.7%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). However, incidence proportion of PPD decreased among women with current mental health diagnoses (41.5% to 31.3%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.19). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> A stable PPD incidence despite increased prevalence of current mood disorders highlights the complexity of the biopsychosocial milieu contributing to PPD. Further study of psychiatric care access and treatment is an important next step in understanding relationships between current mood disorders and PPD during the pandemic.","Waschmann, Rosen, Gievers, Hildebrand, Laird, Khaki","https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2021.0428","20220408","COVID-19 pandemic; intrapartum anxiety and depression; postpartum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29837,""
"Difference in the occurrence and intensification symptoms of stomatognathic system between women and men in medical staff working with patients infected with COVID-19","One of the groups most exposed to potentially harmful effects of the current pandemic on physical and mental health is medical personnel, in particular those working directly with patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The response of the body to a persisting threat, constant contact with dying people and frequent deaths of patients is chronic stress syndrome. Its symptoms may take the form of psychosomatic or somatic reactions. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of stress on the severity of temporomandibular syndrome (TMD) in medical personnel. The study included a group of 160 people - 120 women and 40 men aged 35-60 years, working at the hospital wards as doctors, nurses and support staff, directly with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and suffering from COVID-19. The research was conducted in the form of a cross-sectional survey with the use of anonymous questionnaire. The final questionnaire was developed based on the tools commonly used for TMD, bruxism, anxiety, and depression assessment - 8Q/TMD and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8). After checking the significance of differences in responses to individual questions among men and women and applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, Fisher's test and p-values for individual responses, an increase in pathological reactions was shown. The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant adverse effects on the psychoemotional status and causes or aggravates TMD symptoms. The aggravation of the psychoemotional status caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can result in intensification of TMD symptoms and other symptoms in the stomatognathic system in medical staff working with patients infected with COVID-19.","Bogucki, Giniewicz","https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/147672","20220408","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; orofacial pain; psychosomatic disorders; temporomandibular disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29838,""
"Cancer and Covid-19: a preliminary study on the trauma aspects of Coronavirus in cancer patients","Because of Covid 19, it has become necessary to revise the treatment of cancer patients (""how"" and ""when""). That has had important psychological repercussions. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the impact of Covid19 in terms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Depression and the potential association with coping strategies. We conducted an exploratory study with 106 patients undergoing treatment, using following questionnaires: Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health (SQD) and Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer (Mini-MAC). Only 25.5% of our sample showed symptoms of PTSD and 6.6% revealed a probable presence of depression. In addition, it came up a significant correlation between SQD_P and the coping styles ""Hopelessness"" (r = 0.41 p &lt;.001) and ""Anxious Preoccupation"" (r = 0.45, p &lt;.001). A strong correlation also emerged between non-Covid 19 patients and PTSD (r = 0.29, p = .002). Our preliminary data did not reveal a prevalence of PTSD, but the persistence of the health emergency requires to focus future research on protective and risk factors related to PTSD and psychological distress in cancer patients, in order to reduce the mental health burden of Covid19.

"An Integrated Intervention Combining CBSM and Progressive Muscle Relaxation Improves Immune Biomarkers and Reduces COVID-19 Severity and Progression in Patients with COVID-19: A Randomized Control Trial","COVID-19 is a world disaster. In response to COVID-19 quarantine, stress, anxiety, and depression may easily develop which negatively affect immunity and decrease the patient's response against the COVID-19 virus. This study investigated the effect of an integrated intervention combining Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) and progressive muscle relaxation (PMRs) on immune biomarkers and disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19 and the period to which these changes last. Thirty patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 were randomly distributed into intervention and control groups. The intervention group performed an integrated intervention combining CBSM and PMRs. There were three outcome measures including blood immune markers, salivary immunoglobulin A, and Wisconsin scale. Two-week post-intervention, there were significant differences between groups in the Wisconsin scale total score, Leucocytes, Lymphocytes, Interleukin-6, and Immunoglobulin-A. While there were non-significant differences between both groups in Interleukin-10 and TNF-ÃŽÂ±. The significant differences between groups in the Wisconsin scale total score, Leucocytes, Lymphocytes, Interleukin-6, and Immunoglobulin-A significantly continued 1-week as a follow-up. This study concluded that performing an integrated intervention combining CBSM and PMRs for 2-weeks significantly increases immune biomarkers mainly Leucocytes, Lymphocytes, Interleukin-10, and Interleukin-6 along with S-IgA. Also, this protocol significantly decreases disease severity and associated stress, anxiety, and depression; and enhances the quality of life in patients with COVID-19.

"The effect of COVID-19 pandemic-related financial challenges on mental health and well-being among US older adults","Despite profound financial challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a gap in estimating their effects on mental health and well-being among older adults. The National Health and Aging Trends Study is an ongoing nationally representative cohort study of U.S. older adults. Outcomes included mental health related to COVID-19 (scores averaged across eight items ranged from one to four), sleep quality during COVID-19, loneliness during COVID-19, having time to yourself during COVID-19 and hopefulness during COVID-19. Exposures included income decline during COVID-19 and financial difficulty due to COVID-19. Propensity score weighting produced covariate balance for demographic, socioeconomic, household, health, and well-being characteristics that preceded the pandemic to estimate the average treatment effect. Sampling weights accounted for study design and non-response. In weighted and adjusted analyses (n=3,257), both income decline during COVID-19 and financial difficulty due to COVID-19 were associated with poorer mental health related to COVID-19 (b= -0.1592, p&lt;0.001and b= -0.3811, p &lt;0.001, respectively), poorer quality sleep (OR=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.63, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.86 and OR=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.42, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.58, respectively), more loneliness (OR=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.53, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.02 and OR=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.72, 95% CI: 1.96, 3.77, respectively), and less time to yourself (OR=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.54, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.72 and OR=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.37, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.51, respectively) during COVID-19. Pandemic-related financial challenges are associated with worse mental health and well-being regardless of pre-pandemic characteristics, suggesting that they are distinct social determinants of health for older adults.

"Delayed Medical Care and its Perceived Health Impact Among US Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Medical care delivery has been substantially disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to delays in medical care, particularly among older adults. Less is known about how these delays have affected different segments of this population. Understanding the negative health consequences older adults face from delayed care will provide critical insights into the longer-term population health needs following the pandemic. We used data from a COVID-19 substudy embedded in a nationally representative longitudinal study of older adults, the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. Data were collected between September 14, 2020 and January 27, 2021. 2,672 individuals responded to the survey. Using logistic and multinomial regressions, we determined respondent-level characteristics associated with delayed medical care, experiencing a negative impact on physical health from delayed care, and with reporting worsening physical health during the pandemic. Nearly one-third (32.8%) of older adults reported delayed medical care during the pandemic. Female sex, higher levels of education, greater concerns about the pandemic, and poorer self-rated physical health were associated with delayed medical care. Blacks and those who are 70 and older were less likely to report delayed care. Among those whose care was delayed, 76.5% reported having already recovered delayed care. Nearly one in five (17.6%) reported that delayed care negatively affected their health. Older adults with worse self-rated physical and mental health or who had not fully recovered delayed care were more likely to report perceived negative health impacts from the delay. Regardless of delayed medical care, 10.2% reported worse physical health during the pandemic. One-third of older adults experienced care delays during the pandemic. Despite high rates of care recovery, nearly one in five older adults who experienced delayed care reported being negatively affected. Strategies must be developed to reach these vulnerable patients to increase their healthcare utilization. This article is protected by copyright.

"CENTER FOR TRAUMA SURVIVORSHIP IMPROVES POST-DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP AND RETENTION","Although the need for high-level care persists post-discharge, severely injured trauma survivors have historically poor adherence to follow-up. We hypothesized that a dedicated Center for Trauma Survivorship (CTS) improves follow-up and facilitates post-discharge specialty care. Retrospective study of ""CTS eligible"" trauma patients before (Jan - Dec 2017) and after (Jan - Dec 2019) creation of the CTS. Patients with an ICU stay Ã¢â€°Â¥2 days or a New Injury Severity Score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 16 are CTS eligible. The before (PRE) cohort was followed through Dec 2018 and the after (CTS) cohort through Dec 2020. Primary outcome was follow-up within the hospital system exclusive of mental health and rehabilitative therapy appointments. Secondary outcomes include post-discharge surgical procedures and specialty-specific follow-up. There were no significant differences in demographics or hospital duration in the PRE (n = 177) and CTS (n = 119) cohorts. Of the CTS group, 91% presented for outpatient follow-up within the hospital system, compared to 73% in the Pre group (p &lt; 0.001). In the PRE cohort, only 39% were seen by the trauma service compared to 62% in the CTS cohort (p &lt; 0.001). CTS patients also had increased follow-up with other providers (80% vs 65%; p = 0.006). Notably, 33% of CTS patients had additional surgery compared to only 20% in the PRE group (p = 0.011). CTS patients had over 20% more outpatient visits (1,280 vs 1,006 visits). Despite the follow-up period for the CTS cohort occurring during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting availability of outpatient services, our CTS significantly improved follow-up with trauma providers, as well as with other specialties. The CTS patients also underwent significantly more secondary operations. These data demonstrate that creation of a CTS can improve the post-discharge care of severely injured trauma survivors, allowing for care coordination within the healthcare system, retaining patients, generating revenue and providing needed follow-up care.

"Understanding engagement with Brown Buttabean Motivation, an Auckland grassroots, Pacific-led holistic health programme: a qualitative study","The aim was to understand how participants engage with Brown Buttabean Motivation (BBM) a grassroots, Pacific-led holistic health programme and the meaning it has in their lives. The objectives were to explore the impact BBM had on all aspects of their health and well-being, what attracted them, why they stayed, identify possible enablers and barriers to engagement, and understand impact of COVID-19 restrictions. Qualitative study with thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews of BBM participants, followed by theoretical deductive analysis of coded data guided by Pacific Fonofale and MÃ„Âori Te Whare Tapa WhÃ„Â health models. In this meeting-house metaphor, floor is family, roof is culture, house-posts represent physical, mental, spiritual and sociodemographic health and well-being, with surroundings of environment, time and context. Interviews of BBM members conducted in South Auckland, New Zealand, 2020. 22 interviewees (50% female) aged 24-60 years of mixed Pacific and MÃ„Âori ethnicities with a mixture of regular members, attendees of the programme for those morbidly obese and trainers. Two researchers independently coded data with adjudication and kappa=0.61 between coders. Participants identified the interactive holistic nature of health and well-being. As well as physical, mental and spiritual benefits, BBM helped many reconnect with both their family and their culture. BBM's primary aim is weight-loss motivation. Many weight loss studies provide programmes to improve physical exercise and nutrition, but seldom address sustainability and other core factors such as mental health. Programmes are often designed by researchers or authorities. BBM is a community-embedded intervention, with no reliance external authorities for its ongoing implementation. It addresses many factors impacting participants' lives and social determinants of health as well as its core business of exercise and diet change. Our results indicate that BBM's holistic approach and responsiveness to perceived community needs may contribute to its sustained success.","Savila, Leakehe, Bagg, Harwood, Letele, Bamber, Swinburn, Goodyear-Smith","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059854","20220408","General endocrinology; MENTAL HEALTH; PUBLIC HEALTH; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29844,""
"Participatory mental health interventions in low-income and middle-income countries: a realist review protocol","The launch of the Movement for Global Mental Health brought long-standing calls for improved mental health interventions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) to centre stage. Within the movement, the participation of communities and people with lived experience of mental health problems is argued as essential to successful interventions. However, there remains a lack of conceptual clarity around 'participation' in mental health interventions with the specific elements of participation rarely articulated. Our review responds to this gap by exploring how 'participation' is applied, what it means and what key mechanisms contribute to change in participatory interventions for mental health in LMICs. A realist review methodology will be used to identify the different contexts that trigger mechanisms of change, and the resulting outcomes related to the development and implementation of participatory mental health interventions, that is: what makes participation <i>work</i> in mental health interventions in LMICs and <i>why</i>? We augment our search with primary data collection in communities who are the targets of global mental health initiatives to inform the production of a programme theory on participation for mental health in LMICs. Ethical approval for focus group discussions (FGDs) was obtained in each country involved. FGDs will be conducted in line with WHO safety guidance during the COVID-19 crisis. The full review will be published in an academic journal, with further papers providing an in-depth analysis on community perspectives on participation in mental health. The project findings will also be shared on a website, in webinars and an online workshop.","Heap, Jennings, Mathias, Gaire, Gumbonzvanda, Gumbonzvanda, Gupta, Jain, Maharjan, Maharjan, Maharjan, Mahat, Pillai, Webber, Wright, Burgess","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057530","20220408","MENTAL HEALTH; PUBLIC HEALTH; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29845,""
"Teleworking from home experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic among public health workers (TelEx COVID-19 study)","When working from home (WFH) became temporarily necessary for staff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, it had to be implemented without significant organisational experience or understanding of WFH and its complexities. This study aims to determine the impacts experienced by staff who have undertaken WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an observational cross-sectional study using survey with a purposive sampling strategy for staff from corporate and non-clinical departments. These staff undertook WFH during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. None of these staff had any direct operational roles in a hospital facility and clinical service. Participants' self-reports of their mood while working in their normal workplace and while WFH were collected via the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE), a validated affect balance questionnaire. The responses from the open-ended question were analysed using thematic analysis approach. A total of 143 participants completed the survey responses. Majority (61%) WFH for four or more months as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants rated their skills very highly on the technologies with an average rating of 9 (out of 10) for computer skills, smartphones and videoconferencing/teleconferencing applications. Participants felt WFH was an improvement on normal working, in particular in relation to their ability to concentrate and be productive. The ""SPANE"" relating to affect balance while WFH was completed by 124 participants (85.7%), resulting in a mean score of 5.45 (S.D. 2.98). The SPANE relating to normal working conditions was completed by 127 participant (88.8%) resulting in a mean score of 2.70 (S.D 3.69). This indicated that while participants' positive emotions typically predominated in both situations, they felt slightly more positive on average with WFH. Over 90% participants reported that they would take the opportunity to WFH again if it were offered. Data obtained from the open-ended questions had complimented the findings of the structure close-ended questions in the benefits of remote working and support for their health and wellbeing. The open-ended questions had provided additional information on challenges which the participants encountered during the WFH experience and their suggested preference to sustain this workplace practice. This study highlighted factors that impacted workers' work processes, productivity, physical and mental health well-being while WFH and provided a foundation for considering how to best support a positive WFH experience.","Chow, Palamidas, Marshall, Loomes, Snook, Leon","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13031-0","20220408","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29846,""
"Effects of a staged integral art-based cognitive intervention (SIACI) program in older adults with cognitive impairments: protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Given the aging population worldwide and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been found to be associated with a deterioration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms, investigating methods to prevent or delay cognitive decline in preclinical AD and AD itself is important. The trial described in this protocol aims to evaluate the effects of a staged integral art-based cognitive intervention (SIACI) in older adults with CIs (preclinical AD [SCD or MCI] and mild AD), in order to gather evidence on the effects of SIACI on cognition and psychological/psychosocial health gains and determine the mechanisms. The planned study is a single-center, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial with allocation concealment and outcome assessor blinding. A total of 88 participants will be randomized to two groups: (i) an intervention group that receives the 16-week, 24-session SIACI program and (ii) a waitlist control group (which will receive the SIACI program after completing the follow-up assessment). Global cognitive function, specific domains of cognition (memory, language, executive function, and visuospatial skills), and other health-related outcomes (quality of life, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and physical activity level) will be measured at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at the 6-month follow-up. Blood biomarkers, event-related potential (ERP)-P300, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data will be collected at baseline and immediately after the intervention to explore the mechanisms of SIACI. The trial will elucidate the immediate and long-term effects of SIACI based on neuropsychological testing and blood biomarkers, and neuroscience involving ERP-P300 and MRI parameters will make it possible to explore the mechanisms of SIACI in older adults with CIs. The results will provide evidence on the effectiveness of an AT-based cognitive intervention, which may delay or even halt cognitive decline in preclinical AD and AD itself.

"A Cross-Sectional Study Analyzing Predictors of Perceived Stress Among Elementary School Teachers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Teaching is a stressful occupation due to high-stake job demands and limited resources, which were exacerbated during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study assessed the prevalence of perceived stress and explored its predictors among elementary school teachers employed at schools serving predominantly low-income populations in five cities in the United States. Our study analyzed the data among selected schools that were collected through the Brighter Bites teacher survey which comprised items measuring sociodemographic characteristics, perceived stress, perceived general health, food insecurity, and concerns regarding social determinants of health needs. The predictors of perceived stress were examined using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with schools as the random variable. A total of 685 teachers were included in the analysis (84.9% female, 38.1% Hispanic, 57.6% &lt;5 years of teaching experience). Most (85.4%) of the teachers stated they were stressed ""sometimes""/""often."" Results from adjusted GLMM showed that teachers who were food insecure (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.33, confidence interval [CI]: [1.63, 3.35]), those who had concerns regarding financial stability (2.68 [1.91, 3.75]), food availability (1.69 [1.15, 2.48]), food affordability (2.27 [1.57, 3.28]), availability/affordability of housing (2.21 [1.33, 3.67]), access to childcare (1.76 [1.06, 2.92]), and access to a clinic/doctor (1.60 [1.10, 2.33]) were at significantly greater odds of reporting perceived stress. Our study demonstrates the heightened impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of teachers across a wide range of social needs.

"Does COVID-19 psychological fatigue exist? Results of three online cross-sectional studies conducted in Spain from April 2020 to March 2021","A previously published meta-analysis found that about one-third of the general population experienced some mental health problem during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially leading to a late mental health crisis. We aimed to describe the acute, short-term, and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. A one-year online survey (S) was conducted in Spain (April 2020 - March 2021). We recruited 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°180 subjects using a virtual respondent-driven snowball sampling method (S1 April 2020, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6108; S2 October-November 2020, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6418; S3 March 2021, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5654). Participants completed the Spanish Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Overall, our results suggest a progressive increase in the prevalence of anxiety and stress throughout the pandemic waves and relative stability of depression. Women had a greater probability of having depression, anxiety, or stress than men in each survey (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The youngest group (aged 18-24) reported a higher probability (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) of having depression, anxiety, or stress than the older groups in S1 and S2. Middle-aged people (25-59) had a greater probability of being a case in the DASS-21 scales than the oldest group (60+), except for depression in men (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.179). In S3, the trend changed: the youngest group showed a decrease in depression and stress while the oldest group showed a dramatic increase (anxiety: menÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°664.5%, womenÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°273.52%; stress: menÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°786%, womenÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°431.37%).

"Mental Health Factors That Guide Individuals to Engage in Overconsumption Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Cultural Study Between USA and Ecuador","This study tests a framework that examines the role of several mental health factors (mood, wellbeing, health consciousness, and hoarding) on individuals' overconsumption behavior under the novel coronavirus context. This examination is relevant to public health literature because it increases our knowledge on how the context of COVID-19 pandemic affects people's mental health and provides answers to why individuals engage in overconsumption behavior. Additionally, this research also follows a cross-cultural perspective aiming to understand how individuals from different cultural orientations cope with the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study that compares samples from two countries: Ecuador (<i>n</i> = 334) and USA (<i>n</i> = 321). Data was collected via an online survey. The timing of data collection was set during the mandatory lockdowns and social distance measures taken by both countries to fight against the COVID-19 virus breakout. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the theorized framework. Multi-group analysis was used to explore cultural orientation differences among the relationships included in the model. The results indicate that individuals' mood state has a positive relationship with health consciousness, as people try to regulate their health concerns by maintaining positive perceptions of their subjective wellbeing. Further, the increased concern individuals express in their health is responsible for them to engage in overconsumption behavior. Cultural orientation (individualism vs. collectivism) moderates the relationship between mood and health consciousness. No moderation effect was found for the relationship between health consciousness and overconsumption. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated negative effects in individuals' mental health. Findings from this study suggest that maintaining a positive mood is important for individuals at the time of mandatory lockdowns, and this effort is related to a greater concern and awareness of their health. Further, health consciousness is responsible to stimulate overconsumption behavior. This chain of effects can be explained by individuals' interest in their wellbeing. Culture plays a role in these effects. People from individualistic countries (USA) compared to people from collectivistic countries (Ecuador) demonstrate greater motivation in maintaining their positive mood by showing greater health consciousness.","Franklin, Cintya, Mariel, Pablo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.844947","20220408","COVID-19; culture; health consciousness; hoarding activity; individualismÃ¢â‚¬â€collectivism; overconsumption; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29851,""
"A Qualitative Study of Health Workers' Experiences During Early Surges in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US: Implications for Ongoing Occupational Health Challenges","Health workers (HWs) have faced significant threats to physical and psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent surges associated with the spread of the delta variant in the U.S., coupled with political resistance to effective public health mitigation strategies, indicate that the risks experienced early in the pandemic are not likely to abate soon. This study sought to better understand the experiences, thoughts, concerns, and recommendations of HWs during one of the first major surges in the U.S. and to explore how these experiences might inform efforts to mitigate potential ongoing COVID-related negative health and psychological impacts on HWs. HWs were recruited using a multi-faceted approach tailored to public health mitigation guidelines. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via video conference with front line HWs, support staff, and opioid use disorder service organization providers between April 1 and July 9, 2020 using the Social-Ecological Model as a framework. Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed; transcripts were analyzed inductively and deductively using thematic analytic methods, generating major themes and subthemes. A total of 22 HWs participated in the study; 14 were female; 3 identified as a member of a racial or ethnic minority population. Major themes identified included: (1) Institutions, Infrastructure, and the Pandemic; (2) Working Under Fire; (3) The Political Becomes Personal and (4) Hope. Themes and subthemes explicated the ways in which phenomena at personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, and societal levels affected HWs experiences and suggested potential mechanisms through which negative effects on HW mental health and health may be mitigated. Previous global infectious disease epidemics have had profound negative effects on HWs' health and mental health. This study suggests the potential for similar negative impacts that may be exacerbated by the U.S.'s current sociopolitical milieu. Efforts to systematically describe and quantify these effects and to intervene to mitigate them are warranted.","Goff, Wallace, Putnam, Fernandes, Chow, DaCosta, Clary","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.780711","20220408","COVID-19; health worker; mitigation; occupational health and safety; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29852,""
"The Associations Between Parental Burnout and Mental Health Symptoms Among Chinese Parents With Young Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused numerous unexpected changes for families and societies, which have likely contributed to higher amounts of stress for most parents. This study aimed to examine the relationship between burnout and mental health among parents during the COVID-19. Pandemic exposure and household factors (e.g., family structure, family function) were examined as moderators. An online cross-sectional survey recruiting 1,209 adults was conducted from April 21st to April 28th, 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown in China. The multivariable linear regression analysis was employed to test the association between burnout, household factors, and mental health among parents. Findings suggested that for parents with a young child, poorer mental health was related to a higher level of burnout (ÃŽÂ² = 0.220, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and greater exposure to the pandemic. Mothers of a single and/or young child had considerably poorer mental health. Moreover, the relationship between mental health and burnout among parents was significantly moderated by epidemic exposure (ÃŽÂ² = 2.561, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), family structure (number of children: ÃŽÂ² = -1.257, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; first child age: ÃŽÂ²=-1.116, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and family function (ÃŽÂ² = -0.574, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). This study indicated that burnout symptoms were significantly associated with worse mental health among parents in China. Besides, exposure to the pandemic, family structure, and family function was found to moderate the association between burnout and mental health among parents. Therefore, the present study stressed enhanced access to mental health resources and emotional supports for parents during a public crisis to reduce the deleterious effects of burnout.","Chen, Bai, Fu, Huang, Ahmed, Shahid, Wang, Liu, Feng, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.819199","20220408","COVID-19; Chinese parents; family function; family structure; mental health symptoms; parental burnout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29853,""
"Decreased Transition Rate From Situational Insomnia to Chronic Insomnia by One-Week Internet Cognitive Behavioral Treatments for Insomnia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of the study was to determine the long-term effects of one-week self-guided internet cognitive behavioral treatments for insomnia (CBTI) on situational insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants with situational insomnia (<i>n</i> = 194) were recruited from March 2020 to April 2020 in Guangzhou, China. The insomnia severity index (ISI), pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) were evaluated at baseline and a one-week internet CBTI program was delivered to all individuals. The participants were divided into the complete treatment group (the participants completed all seven modules of the CBTI course, <i>n</i> = 75), and the incomplete treatment group (the participants completed 0-6 modules of the CBTI course, <i>n</i> = 119). A total of 135 participants completed the post-intervention assessments. At 3 months follow-up, a total of 117 participants (complete treatment group: <i>n</i> = 51; incomplete treatment group: <i>n</i> = 66) completed the assessments of the ISI, PSAS and HADS. The transition rate from situational insomnia to chronic insomnia (duration of insomnia Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 months and ISI Ã¢â€°Â¥ 8) was calculated in the two groups. Linear mixed effect model was used to investigate the effect of group (between the two groups), time (baseline vs. follow-up), and interaction (group x time) on various questionnaire score. The transition rate from situational insomnia to chronic insomnia was significantly lower in the complete treatment group compared to the incomplete treatment group (27.5%, 14/51 vs. 48.5%, 32/66, <i>p</i> = 0.023). There were significant differences in group effect (<i>p</i> = 0.032), time effect (<i>p</i> = 0.000) and group Ãƒâ€” time effect (<i>p</i> = 0.048) between the two groups in the ISI total score. The ISI total scores decreased in both groups during follow-up compared to their baseline values, with a greater magnitude of decrease in the complete treatment group. There were no significant group x time effects between the two groups in the PSAS-total score, PSAS-somatic, PSAS-cognitive score, HADS total score, HADS anxiety score or HADS depression score.

Brandwatch and NUVI software captured social mentions on Twitter regarding telemedicine during the beginning of the pandemic (March 15, 2020-April 20, 2020) and one year later (March 12, 2021-April 19, 2021). SAS text-mining software analyzed the social mentions and organized them into ten unique topics for each time period. The research team analyzed the topics and organized them into themes. A network analysis was also performed to examine structure and influence within the network. In March-April 2020, the themes focused on the use of telehealth in general, telehealth for mental health applications, and Medicare covering telehealth services. In March-April 2021, the themes focused on news events regarding telehealth and the rise in prominence of telehealth services. The network analysis shows a shift in the distribution of telehealth information among influential accounts and reveals that the network became more connected, with a change in the control of information spread. Technology Acceptance Model explains the social acceptance and spread of telemedicine.

"Ã¯Â¼Å“Editors' ChoiceÃ¯Â¼Å¾ Developing online lectures using text mining reduces health workers' anxiety in non-epicenter areas of COVID-19","COVID-19 is indirectly associated with various mental disorders such as anxiety, insomnia, and depression, and healthcare professionals who treat COVID-19 patients are particularly prone to severe anxiety. However, neither the anxiety of healthcare workers in non-epicenter areas nor the effects of knowledge support have been examined thus far. Participants were 458 staff working at the Toyota Regional Medical Center who completed a preliminary questionnaire of their knowledge and anxiety regarding COVID-19. Based on text mining of the questionnaire responses, participants were offered an online lecture. The effect of the lecture was analyzed using a pre- and post-lecture rating of anxiety and knowledge confidence, and quantitative text mining. The response rates were 45.6% pre- and 62.9% post-lecture. Open-ended responses regarding anxiety and knowledge were classified into seven clusters using a co-occurrence network. Before the lecture, 28.2%, 27.2%, and 20.3% of participants were interested in and anxious about ""infection prevention and our hospital's response,"" ""infection and impact on myself, family, and neighbors,"" and ""general knowledge of COVID-19,"" respectively. As a result of the lecture, Likert-scale ratings for anxiety of COVID-19 decreased significantly and knowledge confidence increased significantly. These changes were confirmed by analyses of open-ended responses about anxiety, lifestyle changes, and knowledge. Positive changes were strongly linked to the topics focused on in the lecture, especially infection prevention.

Based on the predicted HIV infection risk scores, distinct sexual risk behaviors trajectories of YMSM were estimated and plotted using the group-based censored normal model to identify the predictors of trajectories change over time. Three sexual risk behaviors trajectories were identified: a decreasing low-risk group (7.6%), an intermediate-risk group (67.4%), and an ascending high-risk group (25.0%).Compared to the decreasing low-risk group, intermediate-risk group membership was associated with being from rural areas, current smoker and higher depressive symptoms; ascending high-risk group membership was associated with an education level of high school or lower, being from rural areas, younger age at sex debut with a man, current smoker, higher depressive symptoms and sexual minority stress. Sexual risk behaviors among YMSM changed over time within different trajectories. Identifying YMSM belonging to high-risk trajectories before HIV infection is vital for the intervention and may reduce HIV transmission.","Wei, Tian, Guo, Zhu, Jiang, Yu, Yan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.854616","20220408","HIV infection; YMSM; prospective cohort; sexual risk behaviors; trajectories; COVID-19; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Risk-Taking; Sexual and Gender Minorities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29858,""
"Is Teachers' Depression Contagious to Students? A Study Based on Classes' Hierarchical Models","According to the theory of emotional contagion, emotions in one person can trigger similar emotions in groups within social networks. In schools, the class just like a small social network, that teachers' emotion, such as depression, might be contagious to their students. However, until now there is few studies reporting this issue. This study aims to explore whether teachers' depression be contagious to students and what mechanics behind the phenomenon. Using Children's depression and cognitive scales to assess 2,579 students, meanwhile using teachers' depression and emotional labor scales assess 529 teachers. The nested data from 112 classes were analyzed. Teachers' depression was positively correlated with emotional labor surface and deep acting, and teachers' depression cross-level predicted students' depression inversely. For teachers with higher levels of depression, the teacher's deep acting affected their students' depression significantly, the more effortful the teachers' deep acting, the lower the degree of the students' depression, however, for teachers with lower levels of depression, the deep acting was not significant. The results maybe state that depression in teachers is not readily transmitted to students, one of reasons is that teachers' emotional labor may alleviate the influence of their depression on students. However, considered that teachers' emotional labor was positively correlated with their depression, the teachers' emotional labor may be like a double-edged sword, while alleviating the influence of teachers' depression on students, it also deteriorated their own depression, making it impossible sustainable. For students' depression interventions based in school, including teachers maybe a better selection.","Wu, Lu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.804546","20220408","depression; emotional contagion; emotional labor; students; teachers; COVID-19; Child; Depression; Humans; School Teachers; Schools; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29859,""

"Exploring psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 mandates in children with and without autism spectrum disorder","Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are particularly at risk for adverse psychosocial consequences as a result of unexpected challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These children experience a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety, difficulties with cognitive flexibility, and a reduction in support services during the pandemic. Higher executive function (EF) has been previously found to be protective against negative mental health outcomes. Here we probed the psychosocial impacts of pandemic responses in children with ASD by relating pre-pandemic (EF) measures with mental health outcomes measured several months into the pandemic. We found that pre-existing inhibition and shift difficulties measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function predicted higher risk of anxiety symptoms, with shift difficulties also predicting elevated depressive symptoms during the pandemic. These findings are critical for promoting community recovery and maximizing clinical preparedness to support children at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes.","Celia Romero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0126-691-E73","20220408","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurodevelopmental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; anxiety; executive function; autism spectrum disorder; depression; neurodevelopmental disorders; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","",29861,""
