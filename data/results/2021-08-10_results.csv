"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnoses of common mental health disorders in adults in Catalonia, Spain","Objectives: To investigate how incidence trends of anxiety and depressive disorders have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: Observational cohort study from 2018 to 2021 using the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database in Catalonia, Spain. Participants: 4,255,847 individuals aged 18 or older in SIDIAP on 1 March, 2018 with no prior history of anxiety and depressive disorders. Primary and secondary outcomes measures: Incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders prior to COVID-19 (March, 2018 to February, 2020), during the COVID-19 lockdown (March to June, 2020) and post-lockdown periods (from July, 2020 to March, 2021) were calculated. Forecasted rates over COVID-19 periods were estimated using negative binomial regression models based on previous data. The percentage reduction was estimated by comparing forecasted versus observed events, overall and by age, sex and socioeconomic status. Results: The incidence rates per 100,000 person-months of anxiety and depressive disorders were 171.0 (95%CI: 170.2-171.8) and 46.6 (46.2-47.0), respectively, during the pre-lockdown period. We observed an increase of 39.7% (95%PI: 26.5 to 53.3) in incident anxiety diagnoses compared to the expected in March, 2020, followed by a reduction of 16.9% (8.6 to 24.5) during the post-lockdown periods. A reduction of incident depressive disorders occurred during the lockdown and post-lockdown periods (46.6% [38.9 to 53.1] and 23.2% [12.0 to 32.7], respectively). Reductions were higher among adults aged 18 to 34 and individuals living in most deprived areas. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia was associated with an initial increase in anxiety disorders diagnosed in primary care, but a reduction in cases as the pandemic continued. Diagnoses of depressive disorders were lower than expected throughout the pandemic.","Berta Raventos; Andrea Pistillo; Carlen Reyes; Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin; Maria Aragon; Anna Berenguera; Constanza Jacques-Avino; Laura Medina-Perucha; Edward Burn; Talita Duarte-Salles","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.06.21261709","20210809","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16942,""
"Internet Use impact on Physical Health during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: A Web-based Cross-sectional study","Abstract Background: Bangladesh ranked fifth largest internet user in Asia. Past studies on internet use have focused on its impact on mental health, with little known about its impact on the physical health of individuals during COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this study examines the impact of Internet use frequency on physical health during the Covid-19 lockdown in Bangladesh. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study on several individuals was conducted last year, during the lockdown in Bangladesh. The survey covers demographics, Internet use frequency, and physical health questions. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the impact of internet use frequency on physical health. Results: The result indicated that several respondents had reported headache, back pain, numbness of the fingers and neck pain, respectively. Other factors associated with physical health scores were gender, income (in Taka), occupation, regions, and working status. Conclusion: Frequent, intensive, and extensive use of the internet were strong predictors of increased physical health problems, and the study suggests the need for raising awareness of physical health problems triggered by high internet users among the high socioeconomic group in Bangladesh.","TANVIR FITTIN ABIR; Uchechukwu Levu Osuagwu; Dewan Muhammad Nur -A Yazdani; Abdullah Al Mamun Al Mamun; Kaniz Kakon; Anas A.

"Speeding and Traffic-Related Injuries and Fatalities during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic: The Cases of Seattle and New York City","Despite fewer cars on roads during the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths associated with motor vehicle collisions in New York City and Seattle remained largely unchanged in 2020. Using police data on weekly counts of collisions, we compared trends in 2020 with those of 2019, while controlling for the reduction of traffic volumes and seasonal weather conditions. Results of difference-in-differences estimation suggest that during the early months of the pandemic, or March-May, the incidence rates of severe or fatal injury crashes related to speeding increased by nearly 8 times in Seattle and more than 4 times in New York City. In the rest of 2020, they were still significantly higher than what would be expected in the absence of the pandemic. This research suggests that in similar situations that depress travel demand (e.g., another pandemic), policymakers should formulate plans to reduce speeding which may prevent an upswing in severe injuries and fatalities.","Haifeng Liao; Michael Lowry","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.08.21261745","20210809","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16944,""
"Mental Health Impact in Latin American Pediatric Rheumatologists During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of this study was to assess mental health in Latin American pediatric rheumatologists (LAPRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was performed with 318 LAPRs based on an online, self-rated survey about clinical practice/mental health impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Validated self-reported scales for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7]) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) were evaluated. The response rate was 126 of 318 (40%), including 13 of 20 (65%) Latin American countries. Working on the COVID-19 frontline was reported by 27% of LAPRs. Anxiety and moderate/severe depression were observed in 49% and 25%, respectively. No LAPRs reported previous mental health disorders. Deaths of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 were reported by 8% and 2% of LAPRs, respectively. Further analysis of LAPRs revealed that the median current age was significantly lower in LAPRs with anxiety than in those without anxiety (39 [29-43] vs 45 [30-70] years, p = 0.029). Working on the frontline of COVID-19 (37% vs 17%, p = 0.015), feeling helpless (39% vs 17%, p = 0.009), and experiencing burnout (39% vs 11%, p = 0.0001) were factors significantly higher in LAPRs with anxiety. Median nighttime sleep abnormalities measured by the visual analog scale (VAS) (8 [0-10] vs 4 [0-10], p = 0.009) were significantly higher in the anxiety group, whereas the physical activity VAS was lower (0.5 [0-10] vs 3 [0-10], p = 0.005). A positive Spearman correlation was shown between the GAD-7 score and nighttime sleep abnormality VAS score (r = +0.348, p &lt; 0.001), and a negative correlation was shown between the GAD-7score and physical activity VAS score (r = -0.192, p = 0.031). Anxiety and depression were relevant to the experience of LAPRs during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting their mental health. Reporting information about mental health is essential to planning future preventive and health promotion strategies.","Kozu, Casella, Strabelli, Aikawa, Campos, Elias, Miguel, Polanczyk, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1097/RHU.0000000000001782","20210809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16945,""
"Nursing strategic pillars to enhance nursing preparedness and response to COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia","COVID-19 pandemic caused enormous implications on the frontline staff. The objective was to share our nursing experience in responding to COVID-19 pandemic at a large hospital and its impact on nursing safety and healthcare services. Six nursing strategic pillars were implemented. Pillar 1: establishing corona command centre. Pillar 2: limiting exposure by virtual care model, strict infection control measures, altered patient flow, active surveillance, and contact tracing. Pillar 3: maintaining sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment. Pillar 4: creating surge capacity by establishing dedicated COVID-19 units and increasing critical care beds. Pillar 5: training and redeployment of nurses and implementing alternate staffing models. Pillar 6: monitoring staff wellbeing, establishing mental health support hotline and clinic, providing hotel self-quarantine, and financial incentives. Out of 5483 nurses, 543 (10%) were trained for redeployment, mainly at acute and intensive care units. After serving 11,623 infected patient including 1646 hospitalizations during the first 9 months of the pandemic, only 385 (7.0%) nurses were infected with COVID-19. Out of them, only 10 (2.6%) required hospitalization, one (0.3%) required ICU admission, and none died. Although the number of patients hospitalized at our hospital during the current pandemic was 17 folds higher than the 2015 outbreak of middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the hospital administration did not have to close the hospital as they did in 2015. Proactive nursing leadership and implementation of multiple nursing pillars enabled the facility to maintain the safety of nursing workforce while serving large influx of COVID-19 patients.","Tashkandi, Aljuaid, McKerry, Alchin, Taylor, Catangui, Mulla, Sinnappan, Nammour, El-Saed, Alshamrani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.06.016","20210809","COVID-19; Nursing strategies; Pandemic; Preparedness; Saudi Arabia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16946,""
"Autistic adults' personal experiences of navigating a social world prior to and during Covid-19 lockdown in Spain","The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic brought significant movement restrictions and national lockdowns. These drastic changes impacted routines, social life and support networks for the autistic community. This study investigated the lived experiences of autistic adults with social expectations before and during the first Covid-19 lockdown in Spain. A qualitative Reflexive Thematic Analysis was applied to 10 Photo Elicitation Interviews using images provided by five autistic adults. Interviews were conducted at two time points, before the pandemic and during the first lockdown. Three themes before the pandemic were identified: (1) everyday interactions, (2) finding sense of belonging, and (3) fractured wellbeing, which revealed the participants' eagerness to fit in socially whilst experiencing rejection, weakening their mental health. During the first Covid-19 lockdown, two master themes were identified: (1) daily, positive experiences, and (2) surfacing failures, which emphasised an increased lived stigma as well as an ineffective autism support network, contributing to a heightened anxiety. The current study provides further support to the recent findings highlighting lack of appropriate mental health support for the autistic communities during the pandemic, across the world. Future research should aim to provide more data on the experiences and needs of autistic communities when sudden societal changes are imposed.","Lois Mosquera, Mandy, Pavlopoulou, Dimitriou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.104057","20210809","Autism; Covid-19 lockdown; Lived experiences; Photo elicitation interview; Thematic analysis; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16947,""
"Deliberate self-harm in adolescents during COVID-19: The roles of pandemic-related stress, emotion regulation difficulties, and social distancing","The objective of this study was to conduct an ecologically valid test of etiological models of deliberate self-harm (DSH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a sample of Canadian adolescents, we investigated: (1) the association between COVID-19-related stress and DSH; (2) whether emotion regulation (ER) difficulties mediated/moderated this association, including whether these effects differed by age; and (3) whether the mediating/moderating effects of ER difficulties were stronger among socially distanced youth. Canadian adolescents (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 809) aged 12-18 were recruited on social media and completed an online survey. COVID-19-related stress was associated with recent DSH. Nonacceptance of emotional responses and limited access to ER strategies fully mediated this association. The indirect effect through nonacceptance of emotional responses was stronger among more socially distanced youth, whereas the indirect effect through limited access to ER strategies was stronger among older and more socially distanced youth. COVID-19-related stress and ER difficulties did not interact to predict DSH, nor did age or social distancing moderate these interactions. These results align with etiological models proposing central roles for stress and ER difficulties in DSH. Furthermore, this study underscores a need to support adolescents, particularly older teens with reduced in-person interactions, in adaptively coping with pandemic-related stress.","Robillard, Turner, Ames, Craig","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114152","20210809","COVID-19; Emotion dysregulation; Pandemic; Physical distancing; Self-injury; Stress; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16948,""
"Can measures of sleep quality or white matter structural integrity predict level of worry or rumination in adolescents facing stressful situations? Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has resulted in major life changes to the majority of the world population, particularly adolescents, with social-distancing measures such as home-based schooling likely to impact sleep quality. Increased worry is also likely considering the substantial financial, educational and health concerns accompanying COVID-19. White matter (WM) integrity has been shown to be associated with anxiety and depression symptoms, including worry, as well being closely associated with sleep quality. This study aimed to investigate the associations between pre-COVID sleep quality, WM structural integrity and levels of worry and rumination about COVID. NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30 adolescent participants from Queensland, Australia, completed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning pre-COVID, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) pre and during COVID, and 9 items designed to measure 3 constructs, perceived impact of COVID, general worry, and COVID-specific worry and rumination. Sleep quality (PSQI total) was significantly poorer during COVID compared with pre-COVID. Sleep onset latency measured pre-COVID was significantly associated with COVID-specific worry and rumination. While the structural integrity of a number of WM tracts (measured pre-COVID) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-specific worry and rumination. Follow-up regression analysis using a model including pre-COVID sleep onset latency, structural integrity of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), gender and change in PSQI explained a significant 47% of the variance in COVID-specific worry and rumination. These findings suggest that adolescents with poor sleep quality and perturbed WM integrity may be at risk of heightened reactivity to future stressful events and interventions should focus on improving sleep onset latency.","Jamieson, Kannis-Dymand, Beaudequin, Schwenn, Shan, McLoughlin, Lagopoulos, Hermens","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2021.08.002","20210809","Adolescence; COVID-19; Rumination; Sleep onset latency; White matter integrity; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16949,""
"Coping strategies, anxiety and depression related to the COVID-19 pandemic in lung transplant candidates and recipients Results from a monocenter series","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms in people. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on coping strategies and anxiety and depression in lung transplantation (LT) recipients and patients with end-stage chronic lung disease awaiting LT. We retrospectively investigated coping strategies by using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations questionnaire and anxiety and depression symptoms by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale in 115 LT candidates and recipients. Overall, 63 participants (20 women; median age 59 years [interquartile range 52-65]) answered one or both questionnaires (49 LT recipients and 14 LT candidates). The preferred coping strategy was task-focused for 51 (86.4%) participants, with no difference between LT recipients and candidates nor according to the main anamnestic and clinical data. Eleven patients had suspected or proven depression symptoms, and 18 had suspected or proven anxiety symptoms. Coping strategies related to COVID-19 did not differ by presence of anxiety or depression symptoms. In the current pandemic, healthcare professionals should consider these results to provide relevant psychological help to these fragile populations and promote a systematic and wide multidisciplinary assessment of LT recipients and candidates.","Savary, Hammouda, Genet, Godet, Bunel, Weisenburger, Goletto, Medraoui, Jebrak, Marceau, Tran-Dinh, Mordant, Castier, Montravers, Mal, Messika","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resmer.2021.100847","20210809","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping strategy; Depression; Lung transplantation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16950,""
"Gender-specificity of resilience in major depressive disorder","The major stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity to understand the extent to which protective factors against depression may exhibit gender-specificity. This study examined responses from multiple waves of a 50 states non-probability internet survey conducted between May 2020 and January 2021. Participants completed the PHQ-9 as a measure of depression, as well as items characterizing social supports. We used logistic regression models with population reweighting to examine association between absence of even mild depressive symptoms and sociodemographic features and social supports, with interaction terms and stratification used to investigate sex-specificity. Among 73,917 survey respondents, 31,199 (42.2%) reported absence of mild or greater depression-11,011/23,682 males (46.5%) and 20,188/50,235 (40.2%) females. In a regression model, features associated with greater likelihood of depression-resistance included at least weekly attendance of religious services (odds ratio [OR]: 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.16) and greater trust in others (OR: 1.04 for a 2-unit increase, 95% CI: 1.02-1.06), along with level of social support measured as number of social ties available who could provide care (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07), talk to them (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.07-1.12), and help with employment (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04-1.08). The first two features showed significant interaction with gender (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001), with markedly greater protective effects among women. Aspects of social support are associated with diminished risk of major depressive symptoms, with greater effects of religious service attendance and trust in others observed among women than men.","Perlis, Ognyanova, Quintana, Green, Santillana, Lin, Druckman, Lazer, Simonson, Baum, Chwe","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23203","20210809","SARS-CoV2; depression; major depressive disorder; resilience; resilient; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16951,""
"Trends of global health literacy research (1995-2020): Analysis of mapping knowledge domains based on citation data mining","During uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively improving people's health literacy is more important than ever. Drawing knowledge maps of health literacy research through data mining and visualized measurement technology helps systematically present the research status and development trends in global academic circles. This paper uses CiteSpace to carry out a metric analysis of 9,492 health literacy papers included in Web of Science through mapping knowledge domains. First, based on the production theory of scientific knowledge and the data mining of citations, the main bodies (country, institution and author) that produce health literacy knowledge as well as their mutual cooperation (collaboration network) are both clarified. Additionally, based on the quantitative framework of cocitation analysis, this paper introduces the interdisciplinary features, development trends and hot topics of the field. Finally, by using burst detection technology in the literature, it further reveals the research frontiers of health literacy. The results of the BC measures of the global health literacy research collaboration network show that the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom are the major forces in the current international collaboration network on health literacy. There are still relatively very few transnational collaborations between Eastern and Western research institutions. Collaborations in public environmental occupational health, health care science services, nursing and health policy services have been active in the past five years. Research topics in health literacy research evolve over time, mental health has been the most active research field in recent years. A systematic approach is needed to address the challenges of health literacy, and the network framework of cooperation on health literacy at regional, national and global levels should be strengthened to further promote the application of health literacy research. In the future, we anticipate that this research field will expand in two directions, namely, mental health literacy and eHealth literacy, both of which are closely linked to social development and issues. The results of this study provide references for future applied research in health literacy.","Qi, Hua, Xu, Zhou, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254988","20210809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16952,""
"Exposure to suicide in the family and suicidal ideation in Portugal during the Covid-19 pandemic: The mediating role of unbearable psychache","This study tested the mediation effects of two facets of psychache - bearable and unbearable - in the relationship between exposure to suicide in the family and suicidal ideation in Portugal during the Covid-19 pandemic. Two hundred and forty-four adults aged between 19 and 64 participated. Two groups were defined: one exposed to suicide in the family (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 42) and a control group (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 192). Path analysis using structural equationÃ‚Â modelling tested a mediation model. Results demonstrated that unbearable psychache fully mediated the relationship between exposure to suicide and suicidal ideation, even when controlling for the mediation effects of depressive symptoms, the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis, and years of education. These results suggest that rather than considering just the global experience of psychache in individuals exposed to suicide, researchers and clinicians should look to the presence of unbearable psychache given its contribution to suicidal ideation. Unbearable psychache fully mediated the relationship between exposure to suicide in the family and suicidal ideation It is not the global experience of psychache that contributes to suicide ideation in individuals exposed to suicide in the family rather the presence of unbearable psychache.","Pereira, Campos","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12325","20210809","exposure to family suicide; psychache; suicidal ideation; suicide survivors; unbearable psychache","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16953,""
"Global Prevalence of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Children and Adolescents During COVID-19: A Meta-analysis","Emerging research suggests that the global prevalence of child and adolescent mental illness has increased considerably during COVID-19. However, substantial variability in prevalence rates have been reported across the literature. To ascertain more precise estimates of the global prevalence of child and adolescent clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19; to compare these rates with prepandemic estimates; and to examine whether demographic (eg, age, sex), geographical (ie, global region), or methodological (eg, pandemic data collection time point, informant of mental illness, study quality) factors explained variation in prevalence rates across studies. Four databases were searched (PsycInfo, Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) from January 1, 2020, to February 16, 2021, and unpublished studies were searched in PsycArXiv on March 8, 2021, for studies reporting on child/adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms. The search strategy combined search terms from 3 themes: (1) mental illness (including depression and anxiety), (2) COVID-19, and (3) children and adolescents (age Ã¢â€°Â¤18 years). For PsycArXiv, the key terms COVID-19, mental health, and child/adolescent were used. Studies were included if they were published in English, had quantitative data, and reported prevalence of clinically elevated depression or anxiety in youth (age Ã¢â€°Â¤18 years). A total of 3094 nonduplicate titles/abstracts were retrieved, and 136 full-text articles were reviewed. Data were analyzed from March 8 to 22, 2021. Prevalence rates of clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms in youth. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted. Twenty-nine studies including 80Ã¢â‚¬Â¯879 participants met full inclusion criteria. Pooled prevalence estimates of clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were 25.2% (95% CI, 21.2%-29.7%) and 20.5% (95% CI, 17.2%-24.4%), respectively. Moderator analyses revealed that the prevalence of clinically elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were higher in studies collected later in the pandemic and in girls. Depression symptoms were higher in older children. Pooled estimates obtained in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that 1 in 4 youth globally are experiencing clinically elevated depression symptoms, while 1 in 5 youth are experiencing clinically elevated anxiety symptoms. These pooled estimates, which increased over time, are double of prepandemic estimates.

"Vulnerability of personality disorder during COVID-19 crises: a multicenter survey of mental and social distress among patients referred to treatment","Relational and emotional problems, dysregulation, self-harming or substance abuse often characterize personality disorders (PD). In Norway, COVID-19 restrictions led to an abrupt shutdown of services from 12 March 2020 also including specialized PD treatments. The objective of this study was to investigate social and mental distress among patients with PDs during the first COVID-19 wave. A survey was distributed after the first COVID-19 wave (June-October 2020) among 1120 patients from 12 PD treatment units. The response rate was 12% (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°133).

Problem increase was reported for anxiety (28%), depression (24%), aggression (23%), substance use (14%), and 70% of parents had more child-care difficulties. Self-destructive behaviors (26%) did not increase. The majority (78%) reported increased or unchanged social isolation and loneliness. Occupational activity declined with negative effects on part-time jobs/rehabilitation. Therapist contact was mainly telephone-based (63% Ã¢â€°Â¥ weekly contact). More severe personality problems, current depressive symptoms, and self-harming before 12 March were associated with more frequent consultations. The survey confirms severe, enhanced levels of mental distress among patients receiving telephone-based consultations as the main alternative to specialized PD treatment during the COVID-19 shutdown. The most vulnerable patients received more frequent consultations and self-destructive actions did not increase.","Hartveit Kvarstein, Zahl, StÃƒÂ¤nicke, Pettersen, Baltzersen, Johansen, EikenÃƒÂ¦s, Hummelen, Wilberg, Ajo Arnevik, Pedersen","https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1942980","20210809","COVID-19 crises; Personality disorder; mental and social distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16955,""
"Nurses' experiences of providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan: A qualitative study","In the event of a contagious disease outbreak that reaches the level of a pandemic, the responsibility of providing care for patients increases for front-line nurses. However, being in a nursing role exposes professionals to a range of risks, including but not limited to contagion and mental health impacts. This qualitative study aimed to explore in-depth nurses' experiences of providing care in the time of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The study followed the COREQ guidelines. Purposive sampling was applied to recruit participants. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were used to collect the data from 16 nurses across five hospitals in Taiwan in 2020. Contents were analysed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. The essential structure that was identified was 'Providing care cautiously and being alert to the changing environment', which reflects the progress of Taiwanese nurses in providing care during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The essence of the phenomenon is presented through three themes: (i) facing the emerging challenge, (ii) struggling with uncertainty, fear, stigma, and workload, and (iii) adapting to changes in the environment: learning and innovation. The findings identified multi-dimensional impacts of nursing experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the study yielded evidence and practices that can be used to guide and support adequate interventions to support nursing professionals. By understanding the various aspects of nurses' experiences, policymakers and administrators can better address nursing care providers' professional and mental health needs during a pandemic.","Liang, Wu, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12921","20210809","COVID-19; Taiwan; nurses; pandemic; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16956,""
"Unintended health and societal consequences of international travel measures during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review","International travel measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic represent a relatively intrusive form of non-pharmaceutical intervention. To inform decision-making on the (re)implementation, adaptation, relaxation or suspension of such measures, it is essential to not only assess their effectiveness but also their unintended effects. This scoping review maps existing empirical studies on the unintended consequences, both predicted and unforeseen, and beneficial or harmful, of international travel measures. We searched multiple health, non-health and COVID-19-specific databases. The evidence was charted in a map in relation to the study design, intervention and outcome categories identified and discussed narratively. Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria-nine quasi-experimental, two observational, two mathematical modelling, six qualitative, and four mixed-methods studies. Studies addressed different population groups across various countries worldwide. Seven studies provided information on unintended consequences of the closure of national borders, six looked at international travel restrictions, and three investigated mandatory quarantine of international travelers. No studies looked at entry and/or exit screening at national borders exclusively, however six studies considered this intervention in combination with other international travel measures. In total, eleven studies assessed various combinations of the aforementioned interventions. The outcomes were mostly referred to by the authors as harmful. Fifteen studies identified a variety of economic consequences, six reported on aspects related to quality of life, well-being, and mental health, and five on social consequences. One study each provided information on equity, equality, and the fair distribution of benefits and burdens, environmental consequences and health system consequences. This scoping review represents the first step towards a systematic assessment of the unintended benefits and harms of international travel measures during COVID-19. The key research gaps identified might be filled with targeted primary research, as well as the additional consideration of gray literature and non-empirical studies.","Klinger, Burns, Movsisyan, Biallas, Norris, Rabe, Stratil, Voss, Wabnitz, Rehfuess, Verboom","https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taab123","20210809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16957,""
"Digital mental health and neurodevelopmental services: a case-based realist evaluation","The rapid move online of mental health services following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the potential advantages of digital delivery and has highlighted the need for learning from pre-pandemic digital services. To explore the different elements of interconnected digital mental health and neurodevelopmental services of a well-established digital provider to the UK National Health Service (NHS), and how online delivery enables young people and their families to access high quality assessments and interventions in a more timely, flexible and person-centered manner. A realist evaluation (RE) multiple case-study design was used with 9 cases identified to be representative of the services provided by Healios. The research literature was used to define a program theory and 6 Context-Mechanism-Outcome (CMO) statements. The CMOs formed the basis for initial data extraction with novel elements added via an iterative process. Ten key elements of online services were identified: 1. Flexibility of delivery and timely response, 2. Care is personalized to the individual, 3. Multiple interconnected services enable comprehensive care, 4. Effective client engagement and productive therapeutic relationships, 5. Utilization of multiple communication tools, 6. Clients are satisfied with the service, 7. Good clinical outcomes, 8. Ease of family involvement throughout sessions or from different locations, 9. Facilitates multi-agency working and integration with NHS services, 10. Risk and safeguarding can be managed. These elements supported the 6 CMOs: There was clear evidence that young people and their families valued the responsiveness and flexibility of the online mental health service and, in particular, how quickly they were seen. There was also clear evidence of individual needs being met, good therapeutic relationships, and client satisfaction. Multiple communication tools appeared to maximize engagement and working online facilitated multi-agency communication and the delivery of safe care. The above factors may be related to the finding of good clinical outcomes, but the methodology of this study does not allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding causality. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of interconnected digital mental health and neurodevelopmental services, and how online delivery enables young people and their families to access assessments and interventions in a more timely, flexible and person-centered manner. The 10 key elements of online service delivery explored through the 9 case studies suggest the potential advantages of online work. These elements can inform future research and aid the delivery of high-quality digital service provision.","Burbach, Stiles","https://doi.org/10.2196/29845","20210809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16958,""
"Weibo users' emotion and sentiment orientation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to explore Chinese people's attitudes to the official application of TCM in COVID-19 treatment. We collected data referring to TCM on Weibo from 0:00 on January 24th, 2020, to 23:59:59 on March 31st, 2020 (Beijing time). Besides, this paper utilized DLUT- Emotion ontology to analyze the sentiment orientation and emotions of selected data and then conducted a text analysis. According to DLUT-Emotion ontology, we examined three sentiment orientations of 215,565 valid Weibo posts. Among them,25,025 posts were judged as positive emotions, accounting for approximately 12%; 22,362 were regarded as negative emotions, accounting for about 10%; and 168,178 were judged as neutral emotions, accounting for approximately 78%. Results indicate that the words judged as 'Good' have the highest frequency, and words marked as 'Happy' have increased over time. The word frequency of 'Fear' and 'Sadness' showed a significant downward trend. Weibo users have a relatively positive attitude to the TCM in the COVID-19 treatment in general. Results of text analysis show that data with negative emotions is essentially an expression of public opinions to supporting TCM or not. Texts of 'Fear' and 'Sadness' do not reflect users' negative attitudes to TCM.","Gao, Guo, Wu, Li","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.259","20210809","COVID-19; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); emotion; sentiment dictionary; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16959,""

"Social belonging, compassion, and kindness: Key ingredients for fostering resilience, recovery, and growth from the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increases in anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, burnout, grief, and suicide, particularly for healthcare workers and vulnerable individuals. In some places, due to low vaccination rates and new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerging, psychosocial strategies for remaining resilient during an ongoing multi-faceted stressor are still needed. Elsewhere, thanks to successful vaccination campaigns, some countries have begun reopening but questions remain regarding how to best recover, adjust, and grow following the collective stress and loss caused by the pandemic. Here, we briefly describe three evidence-based strategies that can help foster individual and collective recovery, growth, and resilience: cultivating social belonging, practicing compassion, and engaging in kindness. Social belonging involves a sense of interpersonal connectedness. Practicing compassion involves perceiving suffering as part of a larger shared human experience and directing kindness toward it. Finally, engaging in kindness involves prosocial acts toward others. Together, these strategies can promote social connectedness and help reduce anxiety, stress, and depression, which may help psychologists, policymakers, and the global community remain resilience in places where cases are still high while promoting adjustment and growth in communities that are now recovering and looking to the future.","Slavich, Roos, Zaki","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1950695","20210809","COVID-19; Social safety; coronavirus; empathy; prosocial behavior; social belonging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16961,""
"Impact of lockdowns on critical care service demand in a metropolitan hospital in Melbourne, Australia","There is a growing recognition of the impact of lockdowns on non-COVID-19 demand for critical care services. While a reduction in demand has been postulated, there remains a paucity of quantitative data on the extent and nature of this reduction. The present study aims to quantify the impact of lockdown on critical care services, namely ED, intensive care unit (ICU), medical emergency team (MET) and emergency theatre (ET) demand, during the lockdown in Victoria, Australia. This is a single-centred, retrospective observational study on critical service demand, comparing activity levels during the lockdown (31 March to 27 October 2020) with the matched time period from 1Ã‚Â year prior. There was a reduction in presentations to ED (27.2%), MET calls (27.4%), ICU patient episodes (14.5%) and ET bookings (5.8%). There was an unexpected increase in ICU admissions for metabolic diagnoses, comprising drug overdoses and diabetic ketoacidosis, and a reduction in respiratory ICU admissions. There was a reduction across all ED triage categories, which included triage 1 and 2 patients, indicating a reduction even in life-threatening and emergency presentations. Lockdowns lead to a significant reduction in ICU, MET call and ED demand, and to a lesser extent ET demand. This pattern should be considered in surge capacity and workforce redeployment planning. There are also impacts on public health epidemiology, with potential adverse consequences on mental health and chronic disease management. Further research on the impact of lockdowns on long-term disease outcomes is needed.","Tan, Cross, Ghosh","https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13835","20210809","critical care; emergency medicine; epidemiology; public health; specialties; surgical","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16962,""
"Predictors of mood, diabetes-specific and COVID-19-specific experiences among parents of early school-age children with type 1 diabetes during initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic","The current study explored pre-pandemic sociodemographics, medical characteristics, social/family support, and mood symptoms, and current COVID-19 experiences as predictors of mood, positive/negative diabetes-specific experiences, and COVID-19-specific distress among parents of children with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that parents from marginalized backgrounds, youth with higher pre-pandemic A1c and no CGM use, parents with lower pre-pandemic social/family support and more pre-pandemic mood/anxiety symptoms, and those with more negative COVID-19 experiences would have more depressive symptoms, fewer positive and more negative diabetes-specific experiences, and more COVID-19-specific distress during the initial months of the pandemic. Participants were parents of early school-age children with type 1 diabetes (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 100; 65% non-Hispanic, white, 92% mothers, 75% married; M<sub>child age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.74Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) who had completed a behavioral intervention trial Ã¢â€°Â¥6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months ago and were re-contacted in June/July 2020 to report on their COVID-19 pandemic experiences and parent psychosocial outcomes. Pre-pandemic parent mood/anxiety symptoms, family/social support, and children's medical characteristics (CGM use; M<sub>A1C</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.17%Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.40%) were assessed MÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.45Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years prior. More pre-pandemic social support predicted fewer depressive symptoms, more positive diabetes-specific experiences, and less COVID-19-specific distress during the pandemic. More pre-pandemic depressive symptoms predicted more depressive symptoms during the pandemic. More life disruptions due to the pandemic were associated with more negative diabetes-specific experiences and more COVID-19-specific distress. Parents of color had more negative diabetes-specific experiences. Social support may be particularly important to assess and address through intervention.

"Suicidal Ideations and Attempts Among Adolescents in Kampala Urban Settlements in Uganda: A Case Study of Adolescents Receiving Care From the Uganda Youth Development Link","There is an increasing recognition that suicidal ideation is a major public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. We employed a case study design, taking a case study of adolescents currently under the care of Uganda Youth Development Link (UYDEL). The data analyzed were collected from 219 female and male adolescents (13-19 years) recruited through UYDEL in Kampala, Uganda. A Poisson regression model with robust variance was used to assess the risk factors associated with suicidality. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 4 weeks and attempt within the past 6 months among adolescents was 30.6% (95% CI: 24.8, 38.0%) and 24.2% (95% CI: 18.7, 30.4%), respectively. The most stressful precursors of suicidal ideation or attempt included financial difficulties (59.5%), family breakdown or conflicts (37.4%), and trauma (23.1%). Suicidal ideation in the past 1 week preceding the survey was as high as 13.3% (95% CI: 9.0, 18.6%), of which 75.0% (95% CI: 55.1%, 89.3%) had a suicide plan. Prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 4 weeks was significantly higher among respondents with moderate psychological distress [Prevalence Ratio (PRR) = 2.74; 95% CI: 0.96, 7.84] and severe psychological distress (PRR = 4.75; 95% CI: 1.72, 13.08) but lower among adolescents who knew where to obtain professional psychological care (PRR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.87). Similarly, suicidal attempt was significantly higher among respondents with moderate psychological distress (PRR = 4.72; 95% CI: 1.01, 12.03) and severe psychological distress (PRR = 11.8; 95% CI: 4.66, 32.37), and who abuse drugs or substances (PRR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.01). Therefore, suicidal ideation is a major public health issue among adolescents living in poor urban settlements in Kampala, Uganda. Psychological distress due to financial difficulties, unemployment, and family breakdown are major facilitators of suicidality among adolescents in urban poor settlements in Kampala. Interventions aimed at preventing suicide among vulnerable adolescents in urban settlements in Kampala, Uganda should incorporate this unique risk factor profile.","Bukuluki, Wandiembe, Kisaakye, Besigwa, Kasirye","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.646854","20210809","COVID-19; Kampala; adolescents; suicidal ideations; urban areas","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16965,""

In this group of people, we found out that 59% were single (5,523), 71% were women (6,693). Forty-six percentage were complying with lockdown procedures (4,286), 50% were partially complying (4,682), and 4% were not complying at all (393). The invitation to participate was open from April 24th to April 30th during the second stage of the pandemic in Mexico, in 2020, characterized by voluntary complete lockdown staying at home. Thus, we used a cross-sectional online survey design to assess mental health risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was available on a WebApp designed by Linux<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>, PHP<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>, HTML<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>, CSS<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>, and JavaScript<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>. We calculated descriptive and inferential analysis to describe the mental health average distribution as a function of the lockdown, binge drinking, and experience of abuse. To calculate the reliability and validation of the subscales, we used Cronbach's Alpha and Factor Loading. We run the confirmatory factor loading analysis, and we described the relationship between each latent variable and its item factor load, obtained through structural modeling equations, derived from 179 iterations and 207 parameters (<i>t</i> <sub>[1,171]</sub> = 28,079.418, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). We got a CFI of 0.947, a TLC of 0.940, an RMSEA of 0.049 (0.049-0.050), and an SRMR of 0.048. <b>Findings:</b> The results indicated that reported attitudes such as avoidance, sadness, withdrawal, anger, and anxiety were associated with acute stress, which was linked to an anxiety condition caused by uncertainty about achieving or maintaining overall good health. <b>Discussion and Prospects:</b> People in lockdown mentioned a sudden increase in alcohol consumption. They lived episodes of physical and emotional abuse, in contrast with those who stated that they did not go into lockdown or consume alcohol, or experienced abuse. <b>Limitations:</b> Further studies should diagnose mental health conditions as part of the impact of COVID-19, ensure their follow-up, and assess the effect of providing remote psychological care. There is a need to explore methods to curb the increase in the number of people affected by post-traumatic stress disorder.","Morales ChainÃƒÂ©, LÃƒÂ³pez Montoya, Bosch Maldonado, Beristain Aguirre, Robles GarcÃƒÂ­a, Garibay Rubio, Astudillo GarcÃƒÂ­a, Lira ChÃƒÂ¡vez, Rangel GÃƒÂ³mez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.656036","20210809","COVID-19; anxiety; binge drinking; mental health symptoms; stress; the experience of abuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16966,""
"Current systematic reviews and meta-analyses of COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has left a significant impact on the world's health, economic and political systems; as of November 20, 2020, more than 57 million people have been infected worldwide, with over 1.3 million deaths. While the global spotlight is currently focused on combating this pandemic through means ranging from finding a treatment among existing therapeutic agents to inventing a vaccine that can aid in halting the further loss of life. To collect all systematic reviews and meta-analyses published related to COVID-19 to better identify available evidence, highlight gaps in knowledge, and elucidate further meta-analyses and umbrella reviews that are yet to be performed. We explored studies based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the key-terms, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS virus, coronavirus disease, COVID-19, and SARS coronavirus-2. The included studies were extracted from Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases. The publication timeframe of included studies ranged between January 01, 2020, to October 30, 2020.

"The impact of psychological factors on bereavement among frontline nurses fighting Covid-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably changed the workplace and social relationships of nurses. As potential factors, uncertainty, stigma, and exposure of nurses' families to risk have disturbed the process of providing healthcare services for patients infected by COVID-19. Accordingly, this study aimed at determining the impact of psychological factors on stigma among frontline nurses fighting COVID-19. The extant paper was carried out based on the descriptive-analytical method for April-June 2020. A total of 312 nurses working in educational-medical centers in Ardabil, Iran, were selected using the census method to participate in this research. To collect data, demographic features, stigma, mental health, perceived stress, and hardiness questionnaires were used. The collected data were analyzed using statistical correlation tests, multivariate regression, and descriptive tests through SPSS v.22 Software. The mean score of stigma in nurses equaled 28.36Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 10.55. Results of the correlation coefficient showed a positive relationship between the mean score of stigma and stress (PÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.01) as well as the negative relationship between mental health and hardiness (PÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.01).

"Profiles of grief, post-traumatic stress, and post-traumatic growth among people bereaved due to COVID-19","COVID-19 deaths elevate the prevalence of prolonged grief and post-traumatic stress symptoms among the bereaved, yet few studies have examined potential positive outcomes. Moreover, how COVID-19 bereavement affects individual-level mental health outcomes is under-researched. This is the first study to use latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify heterogeneous profiles of prolonged grief, post-traumatic stress and post-traumatic growth among people bereaved due to COVID-19 and to identify predictors of latent class membership. Four hundred and twenty-two Chinese participants who were bereaved due to COVID-19 completed an online survey between September and October 2020. The survey included the International (ICD-11) Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale (IPGDS), the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). LPA was run in Mplus, and the 3-step auxiliary approach was used to test the predicting effects of potential predictors of latent class membership identified with chi-square tests and ANOVAs. Four latent profiles were identified: resilience (10.7%), growth (20.1%), moderate-combined (42.2%) and high-combined (27.0%). The bereaved who shared a close relationship with the deceased and identified COVID-19 as the fundamental cause of death were more likely to be in the high-combined group. A conflictful bereaved-deceased relationship reduces the chance of being in the growth group. Moreover, the death of a younger person and loss of a partner attributed to maladaptive outcomes. Serious attention needs to be paid to the mental health issues of people bereaved due to COVID-19 because nearly 70% of this group would have a moderate-combined or high-combined symptom profile. Special care should be given to those who lost someone younger, lost a partner or shared a close relationship with the deceased. Grief therapies that work on the conflicts between the deceased and the bereaved and unfinished business can be applied to facilitate growth. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Las muertes por COVID-19 elevan la prevalencia de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de duelo prolongado y estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico entre las personas en duelo, sin embargo, pocos estudios han examinado los posibles resultados positivos. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, la forma en que el duelo por COVID-19 afecta los resultados de salud mental a nivel individual estÃƒÂ¡ poco investigada.<b>Objetivo</b>: Este es el primer estudio que utiliza el anÃƒÂ¡lisis de perfil latente (LPA) para identificar perfiles heterogÃƒÂ©neos de duelo prolongado, estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico y crecimiento postraumÃƒÂ¡tico entre personas en duelo debido al COVID-19 y para identificar predictores de pertenencia a una clase latente.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos</b>: Cuatrocientos veintidÃƒÂ³s participantes chinos que estaban en duelo debido a COVID-19 completaron una encuesta en lÃƒÂ­nea entre septiembre y octubre de 2020. La encuesta incluyÃƒÂ³ la Escala Internacional de Trastorno por Duelo Prolongado (ICD-11) (IPGDS), la Lista de verificaciÃƒÂ³n de trastornos por estrÃƒÂ©s para el DSM-5 (PCL-5) y el Inventario de crecimiento postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (PTGI). Se ejecutÃƒÂ³ LPA en Mplus y se usÃƒÂ³ el enfoque auxiliar de 3 pasos para probar los efectos de concordancia de posibles predictores de pertenencia a una clase latente identificados con pruebas de chi-cuadrado y ANOVA.<b>Resultados</b>: Se identificaron cuatro perfiles latentes: resiliencia (10,7%), crecimiento (20,1%), combinado moderado (42,2%) y combinado alto (27,0%). Los deudos que compartÃƒÂ­an una relaciÃƒÂ³n cercana con el fallecido e identificaron al COVID-19 como la causa fundamental de muerte tenÃƒÂ­an mÃƒÂ¡s probabilidades de estar en el grupo de alta combinaciÃƒÂ³n. Una relaciÃƒÂ³n conflictiva con el fallecido reduce la posibilidad de estar en el grupo de crecimiento. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, la muerte de una persona mÃƒÂ¡s joven y la pÃƒÂ©rdida de una pareja se asocian a resultados desadaptativos.<b>Conclusiones</b>: Se debe prestar mucha atenciÃƒÂ³n a los problemas de salud mental de las personas en duelo debido a COVID-19 porque casi el 70% de este grupo tendrÃƒÂ­a un perfil de sÃƒÂ­ntomas combinados moderados o combinados altos. Se debe prestar especial atenciÃƒÂ³n a quienes perdieron a alguien mÃƒÂ¡s joven, perdieron a una pareja o tuvieron una relaciÃƒÂ³n cercana con el fallecido. Las terapias de duelo que trabajan en los conflictos entre el fallecido y los deudos y en temÃƒÂ¡ticas no resueltas, se pueden aplicar para facilitar el crecimiento. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>: COVID-19 Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¤ÂºÂ¡Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â»Â¶Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¥â€œâ‚¬Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡, Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥Â°â€˜Ã¦Å“â€°Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤Ã¥Â¤â€“, Ã¥Â¯Â¹ COVID-19 Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¥Â¦â€šÃ¤Â½â€¢Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ¥Â±â€šÃ©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¨Â¶Â³Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€°â€“Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾Â (LPA) Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¥â€º COVID-19 Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â»Â¶Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¥â€œâ‚¬Ã¤Â¼Â¤, Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ©â€¢Â¿Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¼â€šÃ¨Â´Â¨Ã¥â€°â€“Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§Â±Â»Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: 422 Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥â€º COVID-19 Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨ 2020 Ã¥Â¹Â´ 9 Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨â€¡Â³ 10 Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¯Â¥Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã©â„¢â€¦ (ICD-11) Ã¥Â»Â¶Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¥â€œâ‚¬Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨ (IPGDS), DSM-5Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ¦Â£â‚¬Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¨Â¡Â¨ (PCL-5) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ©â€¢Â¿Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨ (PTGI) Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨ Mplus Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨Â¿ÂÃ¨Â¡Å’LPA, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨ 3 Ã¦Â­Â¥Ã¨Â¾â€¦Ã¥Å Â©Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¥ÂÂ¡Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â£â‚¬Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§Â±Â»Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â­ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¦Å¾Å“Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥â€ºâ€ºÃ§Â§ÂÃ¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€°â€“Ã©ÂÂ¢:Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¥Å½Å¸Ã¥Å â€º(10.7%), Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ©â€¢Â¿ (20.1%), Ã¦Â·Â·Ã¥ÂË†Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Â­â€°Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶ (42.2%) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Â·Â·Ã¥ÂË†Ã©Â«ËœÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶ (27.0%)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡ COVID-19 Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¦Â Â¹Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Â±Å¾Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦Â·Â·Ã¥ÂË†Ã©Â«ËœÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Â»â€žÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€ Â²Ã§ÂªÂÃ¤Â¼Å¡Ã©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Â¸ÂºÃ¦Ë†ÂÃ©â€¢Â¿Ã§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â½â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¡Â Ã§Å½â€¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤Ã¥Â¤â€“, Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¨Â½Â»Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â­Â»Ã¤ÂºÂ¡Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã¤Â¼Â´Ã¤Â¾Â£Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¨â€°Â¯Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å“Å¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã¥â€º COVID-19 Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢Ëœ, Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¨Â¯Â¥Ã§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¨Â¿â€˜ 70% Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€¦Â·Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦Â·Â·Ã¥ÂË†Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Â­â€°Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¦Â·Â·Ã¥ÂË†Ã©Â«ËœÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¥â€°â€“Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¨Â¯Â¥Ã§Â»â„¢Ã©â€šÂ£Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¤Â¸Â§Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¨Â½Â»Ã¤ÂºÂº, Ã¤Â¼Â´Ã¤Â¾Â£Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ§â€°Â¹Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Ââ€ Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¤â€žÃ§Ââ€ Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¤Â¸Â§Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€ Â²Ã§ÂªÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€œâ‚¬Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã§â€Â¨Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¤Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¦Ë†ÂÃ©â€¢Â¿Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Chen, Tang","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1947563","20210809","AnÃƒÂ¡lisis de perfil latente; COVID-19; Crecimiento postraumÃƒÂ¡tico; Duelo prolongado; EstrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico; Prolonged grief; latent profile analysis; post-traumatic growth; post-traumatic stress; Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬; Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ©â€¢Â¿; Ã¥Â»Â¶Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¥â€œâ‚¬Ã¤Â¼Â¤; Ã¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€°â€“Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾Â","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16969,""
"Endothelin-1 axes in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medicine","Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is involved in the regulation of a myriad of processes highly relevant for physical and mental well-being; female and male health; in the modulation of senses, pain, stress reactions and drug sensitivity as well asÃ‚Â healing processes, amongst others. Shifted ET-1 homeostasis may influence and predict the development and progression of suboptimal health conditions, metabolic impairments with cascading complications, ageing and related pathologies, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative pathologies, aggressive malignancies, modulating, therefore, individual outcomes of both non-communicable and infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of ET-1 and related regulatory pathways in physiological and pathophysiological processes and estimates its capacity as a predictor of ageing and related pathologies,a sensor of lifestyle quality and progression of suboptimal health conditions to diseases for their targeted preventionand as a potent target for cost-effective treatments tailored to the person.","Torres Crigna, Link, Samec, Giordano, Kubatka, Golubnitschaja","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-021-00248-z","20210809","Ageing; COVID-19; Cancer; Cardiovascular disease; Drug sensitivity; ET-1; Embryonic development; Endothelin; Endothelin axis; Female and male health; Individual outcomes; Lifestyle; Mental health; Metabolic impairments; Neurodegeneration; Nitric oxide; Pain sensitivity; Predictive preventive personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM); Pregnancy; Sense regulation; Stress reaction; Stroke; Suboptimal health; Treatment target; Vasoconstriction; Vasodilation; Vasospasm; Wound healing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16970,""
"Targeting phytoprotection in the COVID-19-induced lung damage and associated systemic effects-the evidence-based 3PM proposition to mitigate individual risks","The risks related to the COVID-19 are multi-faceted including but by far not restricted to the following: direct health risks by poorly understood effects of COVID-19 infection, overloaded capacities of healthcare units, restricted and slowed down care of patients with non-communicable disorders such as cancer, neurologic and cardiovascular pathologies, among others; social risks-restricted and broken social contacts, isolation, professional disruption, explosion of aggression in the society, violence in the familial environment; mental risks-loneliness, helplessness, defenceless, depressions; and economic risks-slowed down industrial productivity, broken delivery chains, unemployment, bankrupted SMEs, inflation, decreased capacity of the state to perform socially important programs and to support socio-economically weak subgroups in the population. Directly or indirectly, the above listed risks will get reflected in a healthcare occupation and workload which is a tremendous long-term challenge for the healthcare capacity and robustness. The article does not pretend to provide solutions for all kind of health risks. However, it aims to present the scientific evidence of great clinical utility for primary, secondary, and tertiary care to protect affected individuals in a cost-effective manner. To this end, due to pronounced antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties, naturally occurring plant substances are capable to protect affected individuals against COVID-19-associated life-threatening complications such as lung damage. Furthermore, they can be highly effective, if being applied to secondary and tertiary care of noncommunicable diseases under pandemic condition. Thus, the stratification of patients evaluating specific health conditions such as sleep quality, periodontitis, smoking, chronic inflammation and diseases, metabolic disorders and obesity, vascular dysfunction, and cancers would enable effective managemenet of COVID-19-associated complications in primary, secondary, and tertiary care in the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM).","Liskova, Koklesova, Samec, Abdellatif, Zhai, Siddiqui, Ã…Â udomovÃƒÂ¡, Hassan, Kudela, Biringer, Giordano, BÃƒÂ¼sselberg, Golubnitschaja, Kubatka","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-021-00249-y","20210809","ARDS ; Anti-inflammation, Antibacterial ; Antiviral, COVID-19 ; Cancer, Chronic diseases ; Coumarins ; Cytokine storm ; Disease management ; Flavonoids ; Health economy ; Health policy; Immunity ; Inflammation ; Lung damage ; Phenolic acids ; Phenolic compounds ; Phytochemicals ; Predictive preventive personalized medicine (3PM/PPPM) ; Risk assessment ; Signaling pathways ; Stilbenoids ; Therapy efficacy ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16971,""
"The Well-being and Instructional Experiences of K-12 Music Educators: Starting a New School Year During a Pandemic","In adapting to remote emergency teaching modes during pandemic-imposed conditions, teachers' instruction has changed dramatically. Early research indicates that the well-being of music teachers has suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic and that high levels of depression are widespread. The purpose of this survey study was to assess the continued psychological well-being of music teachers working amid a global pandemic based upon previous research we conducted during the Spring 2020 semester when most teachers in the United States were forced into emergency remote teaching. A secondary purpose was to explore the ways that pandemic conditions have affected music teachers' sense of safety at work and their current teaching situations. Our questionnaire consisted of sections pertaining to (1) demographic and institutional information, (2) well-being and depression, (3) instructional format and preparedness, (4) teaching efficacy compared to the start of the pandemic, and (5) potential positive outcomes of the pandemic-imposed adjustments. In total, 1,325 music teachers responded to our survey. Overall, the participants reported poorer well-being than both published norms and the sample of participants in our previous study. In addition, 17% reported mild depression, 25% reported moderate depression, and 24% reported severe extremely severe levels of depression.

"Perceived Stress, Resilience, and Anxiety Among Pregnant Chinese Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Latent Profile Analysis and Mediation Analysis","<b>Objective:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a major threat to pregnant women's mental health. This study aimed to characterize the patterns of perceived stress in pregnant Chinese women during the COVID-19 pandemic, to examine the profile differences on anxiety and resilience, and to investigate whether the differences in these profiles on anxiety were mediated by resilience. <b>Methods:</b> From February 28, 2020 to April 26, 2020, a sample of 2,116 pregnant Chinese women who participated in online crisis interventions completed an online self-reporting questionnaire assessing their demographic characteristics, perceived stress, resilience, and anxiety. <b>Results:</b> Latent profile analysis (LPA) on two stress dimensions [perceived helplessness (HEL) and perceived self-efficacy (SEL)] indicated four perceived stress profiles: adaptive (33.7% of the sample), resistant (44.6%), insensitive (19.1%), and sensitive (2.6%). The women with both adaptive and insensitive profiles had the lowest levels of anxiety, whereas those with the resistant profile had the lowest levels of resilience. Multicategorical mediation analysis showed that resilience partially mediated the differences in the pregnant women's anxiety between the adaptive/insensitive and resistant profile. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study showed the heterogeneity in the perceived stress patterns of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing the internal mechanisms of pregnant women's anxiety using a person-centered approach, and provided initial evidence guiding the development of differentiated stress interventions to alleviate pregnant women's anxiety during the pandemic.","Luo, Shen, Yuan, Zhao, Liu, Shangguan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.696132","20210809","COVID-19; anxiety; perceived stress; person-centered; pregnant women; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16973,""
"Sense of Coherence and Mental Health in College Students After Returning to School During COVID-19: The Moderating Role of Media Exposure","The COVID-19 pandemic not only threatens people's physical health, but also affects their mental health in the long term. Although people had returned to work and school, they are closely monitoring the development of the epidemic and taking preventive measures. This study attempted to examine the relationship between media exposure, sense of coherence (SOC) and mental health, and the moderating effect of media exposure in college students after returning to school. In the present study, we conducted a cross sectional survey on 424 college students returning to school around May 2020. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess media exposure scale, SOC, depression, anxiety and stress. Correlation and moderation analysis was conducted. The results showed that (1) negative epidemic information exposure, rather than positive epidemic information exposure, was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. (2) SOC was also associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. (3) The effect of SOC on depression was modified by negative epidemic information exposure. With the increase of negative epidemic information exposure, the predictive effect of SOC on depression is increasing gradually. These findings demonstrated that negative epidemic information exposure was associated with an increased psychological distress in the sample. A high SOC played a certain protective role in the adaptation of college students in the post-epidemic period. It is important to find more ways to increase the colleges' SOC level and avoid negative information exposure.","Li, Xu, He, Zhang, Song, Duan, Liu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.687928","20210809","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; media exposure; mental health; sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16974,""
"Relations Between Mood States and Eating Behavior During COVID-19 Pandemic in a Sample of Italian College Students","The fear of contagion during the COVID-19 pandemic has been indicated as a relevant cause of psychological pathologies occurring in this period. Food represents a compensating experience, distracting from the experiences of uncertainty, fear and despair, causing alterations in eating habits and behaviors. The study aims at evaluating the relations between fear of a pandemic, mood states and eating disorders in Italian college students, taking into account gender differences. During the lockdown for the pandemic, a sample of 469 college students equally distributed by gender, was recruited online using a questionnaire including the FCV-19S for the assessment of fear of COVID-19, the profile of mood states (POMS) for the evaluation of different emotional states, the eating disorder inventory-2 (EDI-2) and the binge eating scale (BES) to evaluate the presence of the levels of eating disorders. As expected, all emotive states measured by POMS (tension, depression, anger, tiredness, confusion) resulted significantly correlated with the fear of COVID-19. Women were more exposed to fear of COVID-19 showing greater tension, fatigue, depression and confusion, and a significantly higher total mood disturbance score than males. Regarding the EDI-2 and BES variables, tension and anxiety resulted significantly correlated also with bulimic behavior, while depression with interoceptive awareness, impulsivity, and binge eating behaviors, without gender differences. In conclusion, the negative impact of the fear of COVID-19 on the emotional profile and eating behavior suggests the need to implement strategies against psychological distress during the pandemic emergency, and to design psycho-educational interventions aimed at modifying the lifestyle for preventing risks of mental disorders fostering health-oriented behaviors.","De Pasquale, Sciacca, Conti, Pistorio, Hichy, Cardullo, Di Nuovo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.684195","20210809","college students; eating disorder; fear of COVID-19; gender differences; mood profile","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16975,""
"An Ontology-Based Framework for Psychological Monitoring in Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Especially in the current crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown it entailed, technology became crucial. Machines need to be able to interpret and represent human behavior, to improve human interaction with technology. This holds for all domains but even more so for the domain of student behavior in relation to education and psychological well-being. This work presents the theoretical framework of a psychologically driven computing ontology, CCOnto, describing situation-based human behavior in relation to psychological states and traits. In this manuscript, we use and apply CCOnto as a theoretical and formal description system to categorize psychological factors that influence student behavior during the COVID-19 situation. By doing so, we show the added value of ontologies, i.e., their ability to automatically organize information from unstructured human data by identifying and categorizing relevant psychological concepts. The already existing CCOnto was modified to automatically categorize university students' state and trait markers related to different aspects of student behavior, including learning, worrying, health, and socially based on psychological theorizing and psychological data conceptualization. The paper discusses the potential advantages of using ontologies for describing and modeling psychological research questions. The handling of dataset completion, unification, and its explanation by means of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models is also discussed.","Bolock, Abdennadher, Herbert","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673586","20210809","COVID 19; character computing; education; emotion; mental health; personality; psychological ontologies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16976,""
"Depression Symptoms Mediate Mismatch Between Perceived Severity of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preventive Motives","The present study monitored changes in beliefs about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, depressive symptoms, and preventive motives between the first and second waves in South Korea using an online survey administered to 1,144 individuals nationally representative for age, gender, and areas of residence. While participants correctly updated their beliefs about the worsening pandemic situations, the perceived importance of social distancing did not change, and their motives to follow prevention measures shifted toward compulsory rather than voluntary motives. This inconsistency appeared to be mediated by depressive symptoms, such that negative belief changes followed by increased depressive symptoms were associated with the decreased perceived importance of social distancing and decreased voluntary motives. Our data highlights the importance of psychological responses to the dynamically evolving pandemic situations in promoting preventive behaviors.","Park, Lee, Sul, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.650042","20210809","belief; depression; motive; pandemic; prevention measure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16977,""
"Family Care, Economic Stress, and Depressive Symptoms Among Chinese Adults During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Difference by Urban and Rural Areas","<b>Background:</b> Although several studies have shown an association of family care with a high level of depressive symptoms, the relationship between them remains indistinguishable. <b>Objective:</b> This study aims to examine the associations between family care, economic stress, and depressive symptoms among Chinese adults in urban and rural areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Methods:</b> Based on cross-sectional data collected through online surveys from February 1st to 10th 2020 in China the present study recruited 2,858 adults. It used multiple linear regression to examine the association between family care and depressive symptoms, while economic stress was examined as moderators on the above relationship. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that caring for both the elderly and children was significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms compared with non-caregivers (<i>B</i> = 2.584, 95%CI: 1.254, 3.915), and a similar result was also found in urban areas. Also, caring for the elderly only was also had a higher level of depressive symptoms than non-caregivers in rural areas (<i>B</i> = 3.135, 95%CI: 0.745, 5.525). Meeting the care needs was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms compared with unmet care needs, while for rural caregivers, the results were not significant. Besides, economic stress strengthened the effect of family care needs on depressive symptoms for sandwich-generation caregivers who provide care to both the elderly and children (<i>B</i> = 0.605, 95%CI: 0.077, 1.134). While in rural areas, the moderation effects of economic stress were only found for elderly caregivers (<i>B</i> = 1.106, 95%CI: 0.178, 2.035). <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that we should pay more attention to the family caregiver's mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, more effective policies should be developed to provide financial support for family caregivers, especially for sandwich-generation caregivers and rural elderly caregivers.","Liu, Zhang, Ahmed, Shahid, Wang, Wang, Wang, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.700493","20210809","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; economic stress; family care; urban-rural difference","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16978,""

"Mental Disorders Among Health Care Workers at the Early Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic in Kenya; Findings of an Online Descriptive Survey","<b>Background:</b> Healthcare workers responding to the Corona Virus Pandemic (COVID-19) are at risk of mental illness. Data is scanty on the burden of mental disorders among Kenyan healthcare workers responding to the pandemic that can inform mental health and psychosocial support. The purpose of this study was to establish the frequency and associated factors of worry, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and poor quality of sleep among Kenyan health care workers at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted an online survey among 1,259 health care workers in Kenya. A researcher developed social demographic questionnaire and several standardized tools were used for data collection. Standardized tools were programmed into Redcap, (Research Electronic Data Capture) and data analysis was performed using R Core Team. In all analysis a <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. <b>Results:</b> 66% of the participants reported experiencing worry related to COVID-19. 32.1% had depression, 36% had generalized anxiety, 24.2% had insomnia and 64.7% scored positively for probable Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Depression was higher among females compared to men (36.5 vs. 26.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.003), workers &lt;35 years old compared to older ones (38.1 vs. 26.4%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and those who were not married compared to those who were married (40.6 vs. 27.6%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Anxiety Level During the Second Localized COVID-19 Pandemic Among Quarantined Infertile Women: A Cross-Sectional Survey in China","Infertility usually causes mental health problems for patients and unfavorable emotions such as anxiety and depression can have an adverse effect on women's normal pregnancy. We aimed to compare the anxiety level between infertile female patients in quarantined and non-quarantined areas during the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 759 infertile women were included in this cross-sectional study conducted through an online survey. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) tool. Participants were divided into the quarantined group (QG) and non-quarantined group (Non-QG). Independent sample <i>T</i>-test and chi-square test were performed to examine the difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the average STAI score of the two groups of infertile women, but responses to the emotional state showed that women in the QG had a higher tendency to be anxious. Participants in QG spent more time paying attention to the dynamics of the epidemic every day, and their sleep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and mood conditions were worse (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) than in the Non-QG. The family relationship of QG is more tense than non-QG. Through the research on the infertility treatment information of the overall research population, it is found the average STAI-State (STAI-S) (<i>p</i> = 0.031) score and STAI-Trait (STAI-T) (<i>p</i> = 0.005) score of women who were infertile for more than 3 years were significantly higher than those of women with &lt;2 years. The STAI-T score of infertile women who underwent <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF) was higher than that of non-IVF women (<i>p</i> = 0.007), but no significant difference was observed with the STAI-S score. To conclude, although the second wave of quarantine during COVID-19 epidemic did not significantly increase anxiety in infertile women, it did lead to an increase in other negative emotions and worse family relationships. Patients with long-term infertility treatment and those who have had IVF are more anxious subgroups.","Cao, Hao, Liu, Sun, Wu, Chen, Yan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.647483","20210809","COVID-19; anxiety; infertility; mental health; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16981,""

"The voices of community pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico","Community pharmacists have provided health care services uninterruptedly throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, their public health role is often overlooked. The purpose of this article is to discuss the roles and the coping mechanisms of community pharmacists working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico. A cross-sectional study, using an electronic survey, was conducted to assess the community pharmacists' response during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico. Two open-ended questions explored community pharmacists' opinions about the pharmacist's role and coping mechanisms during the pandemic. The responses were analyzed following an inductive thematic analysis. Two major themes emerged from their responses: professional and personal experiences. Of the 302 participants who completed the survey, 77% of them answered 1 or both open-ended questions. The answers were diverse, and the respondents went beyond the specific topics asked. In professional experiences, important roles as educators and providing continuity of care and emotional support to their patients were highlighted. They also expressed concerns and frustrations on the profession's shortcomings, feeling overworked yet with a lack of recognition. In personal experiences, most of the respondents were concerned about the impact of having to juggle work and home life. They also reported mental health concerns, expressing feeling stressed, overworked, and worried about the constant risk of exposure and fear of exposing their loved ones. Community pharmacists in Puerto Rico ensured the continuation of care, provided education, and managed anxious and stressed patients. Most relied on family members to cope with the extra burden that the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of recognition created resentfulness among participants. It is essential to listen to our community pharmacists' voices to support and respond to their needs and learn from their experiences as frontline health care workers.","Silva-SuÃƒÂ¡rez, Alvarado Reyes, Hernandez-Diaz, Rodriguez Ramirez, ColÃƒÂ³n-Pratts","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.07.013","20210809","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16983,""
"""We Are Saving Their Bodies and Destroying Their Souls"": Family Caregivers' Experiences of Formal Care Setting Visitation Restrictions during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aims to explore the experiences of family caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic-imposed visitation restrictions at formal care settings (FCS) such as assisted living centers and traditional nursing homes. Participants (<i>N =</i> 512) were recruited from an international caregiving social media site that was developed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive data was collected on the family caregivers, the care recipient and facility. Respondents also provided a single feeling word describing their experience and an open-ended question allowed for further exploration. Caregivers were predominantly daughters (<i>n =</i> 375). The most common reported feeling words were sadness (<i>n</i> = 200), trauma (<i>n</i> = 108), anger (<i>n</i> = 65), frustration (<i>n</i> = 56), helplessness (<i>n</i> = 50), and anxiety (<i>n</i> = 36). Thematic analysis revealed four overarching themes: 1) isolation 2) rapid decline 3) inhumane care and 4) lack of oversight. This study highlights the importance of addressing the mental, emotional and physical needs of <i>both</i> care recipient <i>and family</i> caregiver during this challenging time.

"Living Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Community-Dwelling Older Adults' Experiences","Increasing research is investigating the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on older adults, but relatively little is known about the complexities of community-dwelling older adults' lived experiences during this historical period. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature by taking a bottom-up, theory-generating, inductive approach. Older adults living in Central Texas (<i>N</i> = 200; age, 65-92Ã‚Â years, <i>M</i> = 73.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.33) responded to a telephone interview during June-August 2020. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. We identified three key themes: positive, mixed, and negative experiences, with a total of 11 subthemes. A thematic map was developed, illustrating potential connections to mental health. These findings reveal the complexities of older adults' lived experiences during COVID-19 and have implications for developing aging-related policies and community-based interventions during future public health crises. Recognizing the complexities of older adults' lived experiences, tailored policies and interventions can be developed to effectively leverage older adults' effective coping and resilience while at the same time helping overcome negative effects among specific subgroups.","Xie, Shiroma, De Main, Davis, Fingerman, Danesh","https://doi.org/10.1080/08959420.2021.1962174","20210809","COVID-19; Coping; mental health; resilience; technology use; thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16985,""

"Mental health inequalities increase as a function of COVID-19 pandemic severity levels","Current evidence suggests that mental health across the globe has suffered significantly during the COVID-19 global pandemic, and that disadvantaged communities are suffering these impacts more acutely. Lower income, female gender, and younger age have all been associated with worse psychopathology during COVID-19. The goal of this study was to determine whether these disparities are more pronounced in places where the pandemic is more severe. We analyzed self-report data and objective metrics from a large global sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11,227) in order to test the hypothesis that country-level severity of COVID-19 moderates the relationship between the target demographic variables (Subjective SES, gender and age) and psychopathology indicators. Severity of the pandemic emerged as a significant moderator of the relationship between these demographic variables and mental health outcomes. This pattern was extremely consistent for Subjective SES and gender, but slightly more nuanced for age. Overall, we interpreted our data as suggesting that mental health disparities are greater in countries with more severe COVID-19 outbreaks. These findings are critical for understanding the ways that the ongoing pandemic is affecting global mental health, and contribute to the broader literature surrounding collective trauma.","Maffly-Kipp, Eisenbeck, Carreno, Hicks","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114275","20210808","Anxiety/anxiety disorders; Depression; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-10","",16987,""
