"The influence of a virtual reality entertainment program on depressive symptoms and sedentary behaviour in inpatient stroke survivors: a research protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial","Sedentary behaviour among stroke inpatients may be due to high rates of depressive symptoms after stroke. Thus, efforts to address depressive symptoms among stroke inpatients are warranted to in turn lessen sedentary behaviour. Despite evidence that virtual reality (VR) is emerging as a method to help with depression, the use of VR to improve depression among inpatient stroke survivors has yet to be studied. In this paper, we report on the protocol investigating the feasibility of a VR entertainment system at improving depressive symptoms among stroke survivors receiving inpatient rehabilitation. In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 30 inpatient stroke survivors from the rehabilitation unit at Kelowna General Hospital will be randomized to either (1) intervention: 3 times per week of VR entertainment for duration of inpatient rehabilitation or (2) control: usual care. Individuals will be included if they have a confirmed diagnosis of stroke, areÃ‚Â 19Ã‚Â years of age or older, able to provide informed consent, have physician clearance to participate in the study (medically stable or fit), or are able to understand English. Outcome measures to address depressive symptoms (primary outcome), sedentary behaviour, motivation, anxiety, stress, and happiness (secondary outcome) will be administered at two timepoints: (1) baseline (T1) and (2) post-intervention (T2). Study analyses will consider study feasibility indicators and clinical (statistical) outcomes. Means and standard deviations (for continuous variables) and frequencies and proportions (for categorical variables) will be used to summarize the variables. Feasibility indicators will be dichotomized into either 'success' if they meet the a priori criteria, or 'revise' if they do not meet the criteria. Intervention effects post-intervention (T2) for the primary and secondary clinical outcomes will be estimated using linear regression including baseline (T1) controlling for age and sex. The results of this trial will add to our understanding of depression and sedentary behaviour among individuals receiving inpatient stroke rehabilitation as well as the feasibility of a VR entertainment program to improve depressive symptoms, which will in turn may lessen sedentary behaviour in inpatient stroke survivors.

"Brief internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: a randomised controlled trial protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts in many different spheres, including mental health. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable because their central nervous system is still in development and they have fewer coping resources than do adults. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported worldwide. However, access to mental health care is limited, especially for the paediatric population and in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we developed a brief internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aim of this proposed study is to test the efficacy of the intervention. We will conduct a two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial involving children and adolescents (8-11 and 12-17Ã‚Â years of age, respectively) with symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, according to the 25-item Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (t-scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°70). A total of 280 participants will be randomised to the intervention group or the active control group, in a 1:1 ratio. Those in the intervention group will receive five weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy via teleconference. The sessions will focus on stress responses, family communication, diaphragmatic breathing, emotions, anger management, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. Participants in both groups will have access to 15 videos covering the same topics. Participant-guardian pairs will be expected to attend the sessions (intervention group), watch the videos (control group) or both (intervention group only). A blinded assessor will collect data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and irritability, at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 30Ã‚Â days thereafter. Adolescents with access to a smartphone will also be invited to participate in an ecological momentary assessment of emotional problems in the week before and the week after the intervention, as well as in passive data collection from existing smartphone sensors throughout the study. Internet-delivered interventions play a major role in increasing access to mental health care. A brief, manualised, internet-delivered intervention might help children and adolescents with anxiety or depressive symptomatology, even outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect the Use of Antipsychotics Among Nursing Home Residents With ADRD?","To examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the use of antipsychotics among residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in nursing homes. Observational study based on the Minimum Data Set and Medicare claims. Medicare- and/or Medicaid-certified nursing homes. Nursing home residents diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias between 2017 and 2020. The main outcome variable was any antipsychotic use during a quarter. The secondary outcome was certified nursing assistants' staffing hours per bed per day in a quarter. We categorized nursing homes into quartiles based on the distribution of nursing home racial and/or ethnic composition. To explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of antipsychotic use, we estimated a linear probability model with robust standard errors, individual and facility random effects. We used a similar model for certified nursing assistant hours. About 23.7% of residents with ADRD had antipsychotic uses during the study period. The frequency of antipsychotic use declined from 23.7%-23.1% between the first quarter of 2017 (2017Q1) and the first quarter of 2020 (2020Q1) but increased to 24.8% by the last quarter of 2020 (2020Q4). Residents in all four racial and/or ethnic groups experienced an increase in antipsychotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent of the increase varied by race and/or ethnicity. For example, while residents in the very-high minority nursing homes experienced a greater increase in antipsychotic use than did the residents of other nursing homes at the beginning of the pandemic, the increasing trend during the pandemic was smaller in the very-high minority nursing homes compared to the low-minority nursing homes (0.2 percentage points less, p&lt;0.001, based on heteroskedasticity-robust t statistics, tÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.67, dfÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8,155,219). On average, the certified nursing assistant hours decreased from 1.8-1.7 hours per bed per day between 2017Q1 and 2020Q1, and further decreased to 1.5 hours per bed per day by 2020Q4. There was also a decreasing trend in staffing hours across all racial and/or ethnic groups during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in the use of antipsychotics among nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and decreased staffing of certified nursing assistants, especially among nursing homes with a high minority penetration. Future research is needed to explore means for reducing antipsychotic use, particularly in homes with a high penetration of minority residents.","Yan, Temkin-Greener, Cai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.09.009","20221022","ADRD; Antipsychotic use; COVID-19; nursing home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-24","",39596,""

"Managing Fear During Pandemics: Risks and Opportunities","Fear is an emotion triggered by the perception of danger and is a motivator for safety behaviors, including hygienic ones. Within the context of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were ample danger cues (e.g., images of patients on ventilators) and a high need for people to use appropriate safety behaviors (e.g., social distancing). Given this central role of fear within the context of a pandemic, it is important to review some of the emerging findings and lessons learned to manage fear during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, in the current paper, we highlight different factors that determine fear (i.e., proximity, predictability, and controllability), we review several adaptive and maladaptive consequences of fear of COVID-19 (e.g., following governmental health policies and panic buying), and we make recommendations for policies that can promote adequate health behaviors and limit negative consequences of fear during pandemics.","GaÃ«tan Mertens et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E017A-FFF-401","20221024","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; fear; pandemic; covid-19; health behavior","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-24","",39599,""
