"Are we back to normal yet? The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health with a specific focus on schizotypal traits in the general population of Germany and the UK, comparing responses from April/May vs September/October","Studies reported a strong impact on mental health during the first wave of the COVID 19 pandemic in March to June, 2020. In this study, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on mental health in general and on schizoptypal traits specifically in general population samples of the UK (N 1st timepoint=239 , N 2nd timepoint= 126) and Germany (N 1st timepoint= 543, N 2nd timepoint=401) over two timepoints, April/May and September/October 2020. We were able to show that whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cutoff for further psychological investigation declined from the first to the second timepoint in both countries, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were increased at the second timepoint. We investigated potential predictors, using regression models. For schizotypy, we detected a doubling or more of the estimated impact from the first to the second timepoint, including stronger perceived loneliness, increased use of drugs, stronger financial burden, and decreased regular exercise and sleep. These effects predicted GSI, however with a lower increase of impact from the first to the second timepoint. We furthermore found that living in the UK was a predictor for higher schizotypal scores or GSI. However, the results are highly comparable between the two countries. In conclusion, this study shows that while the general psychological impact decreases, potentially showing a normative response to an exceptional situation; schizotypy scores increase, revealing a stronger impact of loneliness, drug use, and financial burden. This development might create an increased risk for developing psychosis in some individuals. The development of the general psychological and schizotypy scores over time requires further attention and investigation.","Sarah Daimer; Lorenz Mihatsch; Lisa Ronan; Graham K Murray; Franziska Knolle","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251726","20210217","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10782,""
"Responsive caregiving, opportunities for early learning, and children's safety and security during COVID-19: A rapid review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life and programs and services that promote and protect early childhood development. Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting children's development. This rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and children's safety and security. There are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies' findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent and child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education. The findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for action-oriented implementation studies and those that go beyond identifying trends and begin to pinpoint ""what works"" to effectively promote and protect nurturing care during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kerrie Proulx; Rachel Lenzi-Weisbecker; Rachel Rachel; Kristy Hackett; Vanessa Cavallera; Bernadette Daelmans; Tarun Dua","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251507","20210216","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10783,""
"Fear and death anxiety among Latin American doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic","Introduction: A patient s death elicits various feelings arise in doctors such as impotence and guilt that could trigger physical or psychological symptoms. Despite its impact, few studies have explored anxiety and fear of death among physicians. Objective: To evaluate perceptions and responses to one s mortality among Latin American physicians treating COVID-19 patients. Methodology: This cross-sectional study utilized the Collet-Lester Modified Fear of Death Scale and the Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) to collect data from physicians in Latin America. Results: 219 doctors from Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Bolivia filled out the online questionnaire. Fear of death among the sample population ranged from 56.2% to 90%. Furthermore, the prevalence of ""High Anxiety"" was 80.8%. A statistically significant association was found between fear according to age and time of graduation (p = 0.010 and p = 0.020, respectively). No differences were found by gender, age, and country of origin or practice. Conclusion: Physicians experience feelings of helplessness and guilt upon the death of a patient and those feelings can trigger physical or psychological symptoms. For these states of fear and anxiety about death, more frequent in times of pandemic, doctors must be prepared, and institutions must provide them with the necessary means to help them overcome these difficult times.","Miguel A Perez; Sonia Indacochea; Jenny Raquel Torres-Malca; Victor Juan Vera-Ponce; Jhony A De La Cruz-Vargas","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251445","20210216","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10784,""
"Changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain","Background: We aimed to examine main changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19. Methods: We used prospective data from 3041 participants in four cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged [&ge;]65 years in Spain. Data were obtained using validated questionnaires through a pre-pandemic face-to-face interview and a telephone interview conducted between weeks 7 to 15 after the beginning the COVID-19 lockdown. Lineal or multinomial, as appropriate, regression models with adjustment for the main confounders were used to assess changes in the outcome variables from the pre-pandemic to the confinement period, and to identify their associated factors. Results: On average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Several subgroups of individuals were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health decline with confinement: (i)-males (for physical activity and sedentariness), (ii)-those with greater social isolation (for diet, physical activity, mental health), (iii)-feelings of loneliness (for diet, sleep quality, mental health), (iv)-poor housing conditions (for diet, physical activity, TV viewing time), (v)-unhealthy sleep duration (for physical activity and sedentariness), and (vi-worse overall health or chronic morbidities (for physical activity, screen time, mental health). On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement. Conclusions: The lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 in Spain, which was one of the most restrictive in Europe, only led to minor average changes in health behaviors among older adults. However, mental health was moderately affected. If another lockdown were imposed on this or future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals with male sex, greater social isolation, poor housing conditions and chronic morbidities, because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions","Esther Garcia-Esquinas; Rosario Ortol; Iago Gine-Vazquez; Jose A Carnicero; Asier Manas; Elvira Lara; Alejandro Alvarez-Bustos; German Vicente-Rodriguez; Mercedes Sotos-Prieto; Beatriz Olaya; Francisco Jose Garcia-Garcia; Narcis Gusi; Jose R Banegas; Irene Rodriguez-Gomez; Ellen A Struijk; David Martinez-Gomez; Alberto Lana; Josep Maria Haro; Jose L Ayuso-Mateos; Leocadio Rodriguez-Manas; Ignacio Ara; Marta Miret; Fernando Rodriguez-Artalejo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251738","20210216","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10785,""
"Associations between movement behaviors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile","BackgroundThere is limited evidence about emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in Latin America.

ObjectiveTo assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the pandemic in Chile.

MethodsA cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1-to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the childs emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers.

ResultsIn total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9{+/-}1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were  more affectionate (78.9%),  more restless (65.1%), and  more frustrated (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors.

ConclusionThe pandemic substantially affected the emotions and behaviors of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile. Mental health promotion programs should consider multilevel approaches in which the promotion of movement behaviors and support for caregivers should be essential pieces for future responses.","Nicolas Aguilar-Farias; Marcelo Toledo-Vargas; Sebastian Miranda-Marquez; Andrea Cortinez-O'Ryan; Pia Martino-Fuentealba; Carlos Cristi-Montero; Fernando Rodriguez-Rodriguez; Paula Guarda-Saavedra; Borja del Pozo Cruz; Anthony D Okely","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251387","20210215","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10786,""
"How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on smoking and nicotine dependence among people with severe mental ill health? Analysis of linked data from a UK Closing the Gap Cohort","Smoking rates are higher for people who use mental health services which contributes substantially to health inequalities. Smoking can lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes, yet it remains unclear whether smoking has changed for people who use mental health services. We examined smoking patterns in a large clinical cohort of people with SMI before and during the pandemic. We found high levels of nicotine dependence and heavier patterns of smoking. Whilst some people had reported quitting, it is likely that smoking inequalities have become further entrenched. Mental health services should seek to mitigate this modifiable risk and source of poor health.","Emily Peckham; Victoria Allgar; Suzanne Crosland; Paul Heron; Gordon Johnston; Elizabeth Newbronner; Elena Ratschen; Panagiotis Spanakis; Ruth Wadman; Lauren Walker; Simon Gilbody","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251467","20210215","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10787,""
"Impacts of school closures on physical and mental health of children and young people: a systematic review","BackgroundThe well-documented links between education and health mean that school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be associated with significant health harms to children and young people (CYP). A systematic review of the evidence is needed to inform policy decisions around school closures and re-openings during the pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook a high-quality systematic review of observational quantitative studies (published or preprint) of the impacts of school closures (for any reason) on the health, wellbeing and educational outcomes of CYP, excluding impacts of closure on transmission of infection (PROSPERO CRD42020181658). We used a machine learning approach for screening articles, with decisions on inclusion and data extraction performed independently by 2 researchers. Quality was assessed for study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken as data did not allow meta-analysis.

Results16,817 records were screened, of which 151 were reviewed in full-text and 72 studies were included from 20 countries. 33% were cohort studies using historical control periods; 19% pre-post studies; and 46% cross-sectional studies which assessed change by comparison with population reference data. 63% were high-quality, 25% medium-quality and 13% low-quality. Cause of closure in all studies was the first COVID-19 pandemic wave with the exception of 5 influenza studies and 1 teacher strike.

27 studies concerning mental health identified considerable impacts across emotional, behavioural and restlessness/inattention problems; 18-60% of CYP scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms. Two studies reported non-significant rises in suicide rates. Self-harm and psychiatric attendances were markedly reduced, indicating a rise in unmet mental health need. Child protection referrals fell 27-39%, with a halving of the expected number of referrals originating in schools.

19 studies concerning health service use showed marked reductions in emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions, with evidence of delayed presentations and potential widening of inequalities in vaccination coverage. Data suggested marked rises in screen-time and social media use and reductions in physical activity however data on sleep and diet were inconclusive. Available data suggested likely higher harms in CYP from more deprived populations.

ConclusionsSchool closures as part of broader social distancing measures are associated with considerable harms to CYP health and wellbeing. Available data are short-term and longer-term harms are likely to be magnified by further school closures. Data are urgently needed on longer-term impacts using strong research designs, particularly amongst vulnerable groups. These findings are important for policy-makers seeking to balance the risks of transmission through school-aged children with the harms of closing schools.","Russell M.

"Associations between feelings/behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and depression/anxiety after lockdown in a sample of Chinese children and adolescents","Children and adolescents may be more susceptible to mental disorders due to COVID-19 pandemic than adults. This study aimed to identify correlated factors for depression/anxiety among children and adolescents after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. An online survey by cluster sampling was conducted after lockdown in 5175 Chinese children and adolescents with informed consents from their parents. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales with 10-point cutoff were used to measure depression and anxiety, separately. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted. Stata 15.1 Version was used. 12.33% and 6.26% of all participants reported depression and anxiety after lockdown, separately. Suicidal ideation, quarreling with parents, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating during online learning, and anxious and depressed mood during lockdown were positively associated with depression and anxiety after lockdown. Missing teachers was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Living in urban and not living with parents were positively associated with depression. The past history and familial history of mental disorders have not been collected. The recall biases for collecting self-reporting information might exist, and the causal inferences cannot be drawn. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents might decline a bit after lockdown but is still at a high level after lockdown. Gatekeepers should pay more attention to modifiable factors of psychological well-being in children and adolescents, including family and school contexts and even feelings and behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.","Liu, Yue, Hu, Zhu, Wu, Wang, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.001","20210216","Anxiety; COVID-19 lockdown; Children and adolescents; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10789,""
"Impact of the first Covid-19 pandemic wave on first episode psychosis in Milan, italy","The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic appears to increase risk for mental illness, either directly due to inflammation caused by the virus or indirectly due to related psychosocial stress, resulting in the development of both anxious-depressive and psychotic symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to assess the frequency and characteristics of all patients with First Episodes Psychosis (FEP) without COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the first four months since lockdown in Milan. We recruited sixty-two patients hospitalized between March 8 to July 8, 2020 versus those firstÃ‚ hospitalized in the same period in 2019. The two subgroups were compared for sociodemographic variables and clinical characteristics of the episodes. Patients with FEP in 2020 were significantly older than patients with FEP in 2021, and presented with significantly less substances abuse. Interestingly, patients presenting with FEP in 2020 were significantly older than patients with FEP in 2019.

"Improving racial disparities in unmet palliative care needs among intensive care unit family members with a needs-targeted app intervention: The ICUconnect randomized clinical trial","The technologies used to treat the millions who receive care in intensive care unit (ICUs) each year have steadily advanced. However, the quality of ICU-based communication has remained suboptimal, particularly concerning for Black patients and their family members. Therefore we developed a mobile app intervention for ICU clinicians and family members called ICUconnect that assists with delivering need-based care. To describe the methods and early experiences of a clustered randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare ICUconnect vs. usual care. The goal of this two-arm, parallel group clustered RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the ICUconnect intervention in improving outcomes overall and for each racial subgroup on reducing racial disparities in core palliative care outcomes over a 3-month follow up period. ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care. In this manuscript, we also describe steps taken to adapt the ICUconnect intervention to the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare setting.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer surgery: Patient's perspective","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted cancer care globally. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on cancer healthcare from the perspective of patients with cancer. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between June 19, 2020, to August 7, 2020, using a questionnaire designed by patients awaiting cancer surgery. We examined the impact of COVID-19 on five domains (financial status, healthcare access, stress, anxiety, and depression)Ã‚Â and their relationship with various patient-related variables. Factors likely to determine the influence of COVID-19 on patient care were analyzed. A significant adverse impact was noted in all five domains (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), with the maximal impact felt in the domain of financial status followed by healthcare access.

Unlike crises in the more recent past, such as the bombing of the Twin Towers and Pentagon on 9/11, COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic, affecting nearly every person on the planet in some shape or form. It is not only the physical effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that are lethal; the mental health effects are also taking their toll. The impact of physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, job loss, isolation, and fear have resulted in a considerably greater number of people's experiencing symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder in the United States. Accessing health care services has been a particular challenge given concerns about exposure to the virus and an overwhelmed health care delivery system. In response, policymakers at the federal and state levels implemented changes aimed at addressing access to essential care to include telehealth services. As the public experiences firsthand the struggles of coping with mental health issues in a fragmented dysfunctional health system, there is an opportunity is to use this crisis as a springboard to advocate for permanent changes to promote telehealth, to elevate the importance of integrated behavioral health, and to support the destigmatization of mental illness.

"Parental Buffering of Stress in the Time of COVID-19: Family-Level Factors MayÃ‚Â Moderate the Association Between Pandemic-Related Stress and Youth Symptomatology","Nearly all families in the United States were exposed to varying degrees of stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic during the spring of 2020. Building on previous research documenting the pernicious effects of stress on youth mental health, we aimed to test the effects of exposure to COVID-19-related stress on youth symptomatology. Further, in light of evidence suggesting that parents play an important role in buffering children from environmental stress, we assessed how specific parental behaviors (i.e., parental emotion socialization, maintenance of home routines, and availability to discuss the pandemic with child) contributed to effective parental buffering of the impact of pandemic-related stress on children's symptomatology. Conversely, we tested whether parental anxiety-related symptomatology and parenting stress exacerbated the effect of children's exposure to pandemic-related stress on children's symptomatology. Results suggest that parents who engaged in relatively higher levels of emotion coaching of children's negative emotions and who maintained more stable home routines during the pandemic were more effectively able to buffer the effects of pandemic-related stress on children's symptomatology. Parents who reported higher levels of parenting stress and anxiety-related symptomatology were less likely to effectively buffer stress. Though interpretation of the findings is limited due to sole reliance on parental report and the cross-sectional study design due to the constraints of collecting data during a global pandemic, findings underscore the importance of assessing family-level factors when considering the impact of stressors on children's symptomatology and highlight the need to support parents during global events that place families under significant stress.","Cohodes, McCauley, Gee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-020-00732-6","20210216","COVID-19; Emotion socialization; Parental buffering; Parenting; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10795,""

Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burr resulted in detectable droplets. Greater droplet spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. The addition of a suction catheter reduces droplet spread when drilling. Activation of the microdebrider when there is fluid excess fluid (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive mucosal bleeding or irrigation fluid) accumulating in the nasal cavity resulted in detectable droplet spread.

"Civil unrest, COVID-19 stressors, anxiety, and depression in the acute phase of the pandemic: a population-based study in Hong Kong","To examine the joint associations of civil unrest and COVID-19 with probable anxiety and depression during the first half of 2020 in Hong Kong. Associations were compared between persons with low or high assets. A population-representative sample of 4011 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 15Ã‚Â years or older were recruited between February and May 2020. Respondents reported current anxiety and depressive symptoms, unrest stress, COVID-19 stress, assets (savings and home ownership), and demographics. Stress due to unrest and COVID-19 was associated with higher prevalence of probable anxiety and depression; persons with both stressors had higher prevalence. This pattern was consistent among persons with low or high assets, but the probabilities of mental disorder were substantially higher among persons with fewer assets. The effect of stressors on probable anxiety and depression are cumulative: persons with stress due to civil unrest and to COVID-19 reported more mental disorders than persons with stress due to only one, or none of these factors. Overall high assets appear to buffer the consequences of stressors, lowering the risk of mental disorder.","Hou, Lee, Liang, Li, Liu, Ettman, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02037-5","20210216","Anxiety; Assets; COVID-19; Civil unrest; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10798,""
"The quality of life of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents during the Coronavirus disease 19 emergency in Japan","This study aimed to reveal how the COVID-19 stay-at-home period has affected the quality of life (QOL) of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents and to identify possible factors that enabled them to maintain their QOL. We enrolled 136 school-aged children (intellectual quotientÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°50) and their parents and administered QOL questionnaires to assess the maladaptive behavior of the children; depression, anxiety, and stress of the parents; and activities of their daily lives. The relationship between their QOL and clinical features was examined. The decrease in QOL of children and parents was associated with the mother's limited job flexibility. Decreased QOL was also associated with changes in the sleep rhythms of the children. Maladaptive behaviors in children were associated with parental stress. However, maintained QOL of some families who faced these same conditions of job stress and sleep disorders was associated with less parental stress, less parental depression and anxiety, and milder maladaptive behavior in children. Both mothers with limited job flexibility and changes in the sleep rhythm of children were associated with reduced QOL of children and their parents. Low parental stress was associated with decreased maladaptive behavior in children and with maintained QOL of the family.","Ueda, Okada, Kita, Ozawa, Inoue, Shioda, Kono, Kono, Nakamura, Amemiya, Ito, Sugiura, Matsuoka, Kaiga, Kubota, Ozawa","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82743-x","20210216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10799,""
"CCopeY: A Mixed-Methods Coproduced Study on the Mental Health Status and Coping Strategies of Young People During COVID-19 UK Lockdown","Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people's mental health is an increasing priority. Studies to date are largely surveys and lack meaningful involvement from service users in their design, planning, and delivery. The study aimed to examine the mental health status and coping strategies of young people during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown using coproduction methodology. The mental health status of young people (aged 16-24) in April 2020 was established utilizing a sequential explanatory coproduced mixed methods design. Factors associated with poor mental health status, including coping strategies, were also examined using an online survey and semi-structured interviews. Since the lockdown, 30.3% had poor mental health, and 10.8% had self-harmed. Young people identifying as Black/Black-British ethnicity had the highest increased odds of experiencing poor mental health (odds ratio [OR] 3.688, 95% CI .54-25.40). Behavioral disengagement (OR 1.462, 95% CI 1.22-1.76), self-blame (OR 1.307 95% CI 1.10-1.55), and substance use (OR 1.211 95% CI 1.02-1.44) coping strategies, negative affect (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.07-1.15), sleep problems (OR .915 95% CI .88-.95) and conscientiousness personality trait (OR .819 95% CI .69-.98) were significantly associated with poor mental health. Three qualitative themes were identified: (1) pre-existing/developed helpful coping strategies employed, (2) mental health difficulties worsened, and (3) mental health and nonmental health support needed during and after lockdown. Poor mental health is associated with dysfunctional coping strategies. Innovative coping strategies can help other young people cope during and after lockdowns, with digital and school promotion and application.","Dewa, Crandell, Choong, Jaques, Bottle, Kilkenny, Lawrence-Jones, Di Simplicio, Nicholls, Aylin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.009","20210216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10800,""
"Antimicrobial resistance and COVID-19: Intersections and implications","Before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was among the top priorities for global public health. Already a complex challenge, AMR now needs to be addressed in a changing healthcare landscape. Here, we analyse how changes due to COVID-19 in terms of antimicrobial usage, infection prevention, and health systems affect the emergence, transmission, and burden of AMR. Increased hand hygiene, decreased international travel, and decreased elective hospital procedures may reduce AMR pathogen selection and spread in the short term. However, the opposite effects may be seen if antibiotics are more widely used as standard healthcare pathways break down. Over 6 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the dynamics of AMR remain uncertain. We call for the AMR community to keep a global perspective while designing finely tuned surveillance and research to continue to improve our preparedness and response to these intersecting public health challenges.","Knight, Glover, McQuaid, Olaru, Gallandat, Leclerc, Fuller, Willcocks, Hasan, van Kleef, Chandler","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64139","20210216","COVID-19; antimicrobial resistance; epidemiology; global health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10801,""
"Psychosis, Telehealth, and COVID-19: Successes and Lessons Learned from the First Wave of the Pandemic","This brief report analyzes a first-episode psychosis (FEP) clinic's shift from in-person treatment to the provision of services through telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The feasibility of using this technology was examined by assessing client engagement. The authors created and implemented procedures for the clinic's transition to telemental health. Once clients' consent was obtained, a HIPAA compliant platform was used to continue service provision. Client engagement during this period improved compared to the same quarter the previous year. Telemental health was also practical for providing groups and other supportive services to meet clients' needs. Telemental health is an effective approach to providing care at an FEP clinic during a pandemic. Successes and lessons learned from the first wave of the pandemic can be used to prevent an uptick in symptoms and sustain engagement for this vulnerable population during the anticipated second wave.","Chaudhry, Weiss, Dillon, O'Shea, Hansel","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.42","20210216","Community mental health; mental disorders; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10802,""
"The effects of disease-related knowledge on illness perception and psychological status of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan, China","To assess the current status of disease-related knowledge and to analyze the relationship among the general condition, illness perception, and psychological status of patients with COVID-19. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 118 patients using convenience sampling. The general questionnaire, disease-related knowledge questionnaire of COVID-19, Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), and Profile of Mood States (POMS) were used to measure the current status of participants. The overall average score of the disease-related knowledge of patients with COVID-19 was (79.19 Ã‚Â± 14.25), the self-care situation was positively correlated with knowledge of prevention and control (r=0.265, P=0.004) and total score of disease-related knowledge (r= 0.206, P= 0.025); the degree of anxiety was negatively correlated with the knowledge of diagnosis and treatment (r= -0.182, P= 0.049). The score of disease-related knowledge was negatively correlated with negative cognition (volatility, consequences, emotional statements) and negative emotions (tension, fatigue, depression) (P&lt;0.05); positively correlated with positive cognition (disease coherence) and positive emotion (self-esteem) (P&lt;0.05). It was recommended that we should pay more attention to the elderly and low-income groups, and increase the knowledge about diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and self-care in the future health education for patients.","Ye, Chen, Li, Huang, Mei, Qiu, Li, Zhang, Chen, Xie, Cheng, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.33","20210216","COVID-19; Illness perception; Knowledge; Psychological state","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10803,""
"Health anxiety and related factors among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study from Iran","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries around the world and Iran was no exception. The aim of this study was to evaluate health anxiety of Iranian pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 300 pregnant women in different trimesters (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°100 in each trimester) were recruited. A demographic questionnaire and the Health Anxiety Questionnaire were used to collect data. Scores of &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°27, 27-34 and more than 35 were defined as low, moderate and high health anxiety, respectively. Due to nationwide restrictions, data were collected through social media groups. Chi-square tests, ANOVA and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. Mean (SD) total anxiety scores were 22.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.5, 24.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.3 and 25.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.6 in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. 9, 13 and 21% of women had severe anxiety in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. Women in the third trimester had significantly higher health anxiety scores than those in the first trimester (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.045). At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy were more worried about consequences of disease, but total health anxiety scores were significantly higher among women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Health care providers should pay more attention to the mental health of pregnant women in times of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Saadati, Afshari, Boostani, Beheshtinasab, Abedi, Maraghi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03092-7","20210216","COVID-19; Corona virus; Health anxiety; Pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10804,""
"The COVID-19 Family Stressor Scale: Validation and Measurement Invariance in Female and Male Caregivers","The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns regarding the effect of social disruptions on parental mental health, family well-being, and childrenâ€™s adjustment. Due to the pace of the pandemic, measures of pandemic-related disruption have not been subject to rigorous empirical validation. To address this gap, a multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%; United States, 19%; Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) of 372 female caregivers and 158 male caregivers of 5-18 year-old children was recruited online. Participants completed a survey including a 25-item scale indexing disruption in finances, basic needs, personal and family welfare, career/education, household responsibilities, and family relationships related to the pandemic. An exploratory factor analysis yielded an optimal three-factor solution: factors included Income Stress (5 items related to income, debt, and job loss; loadings ranged from .57 to .91), Family Stress (7 items related to family altercations and child management; loadings from .57 to .87), and Chaos Stress (4 items related to access to supplies, crowded shopping areas, news coverage; loadings from .53 to .70). Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated measurement invariance of each factor across female and male caregivers, indicating that factor structure, loadings, and thresholds were equivalent across groups. Composites reflective of each factor were computed, and paired samples t-tests showed that female caregivers consistently report higher levels of COVID-19 stress related to income, family, and chaos compared to male caregivers. Finally, concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant bivariate correlations between each scale and indicators of parental and child mental health and family relationships. This demonstrates validity of the COVID-19 Family Stressor Scale for use with female and male caregivers in family-based research. The current sample was predominantly White-European. Additional sampling and validation efforts are required in order to provide adequate description of racialized and minority communities at disproportionate risk of social consequences related to the pandemic.","Heather Prime et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46241-04C-02E","20210217","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Couples, Marriage, and Family; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; covid-19; caregivers; child mental health; social disruption; family stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-17","",10805,""
