"Mental Health Concerns Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Twitter in the UK","Background: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health-related symptoms (such as depression and anxiety) have been actively mentioned on social media. Objective: In this study, we aimed to monitor mental health concerns on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom (UK), and assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health concerns of Twitter users. Methods: We collected COVID-19 and mental health-related tweets from the UK between March 5, 2020 and January 31, 2021 through the Twitter Streaming API. We conducted topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to examine discussions about mental health concerns. Deep learning algorithms including Face++ were used to infer the demographic characteristics (age and gender) of Twitter users who expressed mental health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We showed a positive correlation between COVID-19-related mental health concerns on Twitter and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Geographic analysis showed that populated urban areas have a higher proportion of Twitter users with mental health concerns compared to England as a whole. Topic modeling showed that general concerns, COVID-19 skeptics, and Death toll were the top topics discussed in mental health-related tweets. Demographic analysis showed that middle-aged and older adults might be more likely to suffer from mental health issues or express their mental health concerns on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has noticeable effects on mental health concerns on Twitter in the UK, which varied among demographic and geographic groups.","Daiwei Zhang; Yue Liu; Senqi Zhang; Li Sun; Pin Li; Ajay Anand; Zidian Xie; Dongmei Li","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.27.21264177","20210929","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18425,""
"The International Sexual Health And Reproductive Health Survey (I-SHARE-1): A Cross-Sectional Multi-Country Analysis of Adults from 30 Countries Prior to and During the Initial COVID-19 Wave","BackgroundTo better understand sexual and reproductive health (SRH) during the initial COVID-19 wave, we organized a multi-country cross-sectional survey.

MethodsConsortium research teams conducted online surveys in 30 countries. Primary outcomes included sexual behaviors, partner violence, and SRH service utilization, and we compared three months prior to and three months after policy measures to mitigate COVID-19. We used established indicators and analyses pre-specified in our protocol. We conducted meta-analyses for primary outcomes and graded the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methods.

FindingsDescriptive analyses included 22,724 individuals in 25 countries. Five additional countries with sample sizes <200 were included in descriptive meta-analyses. Respondents were mean age 34 years; most identified as women (15160; 66.7%), cis-gender (19432; 86.6%) and heterosexual (16592; 77.9%). Among 4546 respondents with casual partners, condom use stayed steady for 3374 (74.4%); 640 (14.1%) reported a decline. Fewer respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence during COVID-19 measures (1063/15144, 7.0%) than before (1469/15887, 9.3%). COVID-19 measures impeded access to condoms (933/10790, 8.7%), contraceptives (610/8175, 7.5%), and HIV/STI testing (750/1965, 30.7%). Pooled estimates from meta-analysis indicate during COVID-19 measures, 32.3% (95% CI 23.9-42.1) of people needing HIV/STI testing had hindered access, 4.4% (95% CI 3.4-5.4) experienced partner violence, and 5.8% (95% CI 5.4-8.2) decreased casual partner condom use (moderate certainty of evidence for each outcome). Meta-analysis findings were robust in sensitivity analyses that examined country income level, sample size, and sampling strategy.

InterpretationThe initial COVID-19 wave impacted SRH behaviors and access to services across diverse global settings.

Research in context Evidence before this studyIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced billions of people to shelter in place, altering social and sexual relationships worldwide. In many settings, COVID-19 undercut already precarious health infrastructure and health service provision. However, there is limited evidence to date about changes to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19 disease). Most studies have focused on high-income countries, rather than examining broader regional and global trends. To address this gap, our team organized a multi-country, cross-sectional online survey as part of a global consortium. Consortium research teams in 30 low, middle, and high-income countries collaboratively developed the survey instrument using existing measures and items adapted for COVID-19. Topics included sociodemographic characteristics; compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures; couple and family relationships; sexual behavior; contraceptive use and barriers to access; access to reproductive healthcare; abortion; sexual violence and intimate partner violence (IPV); HIV/STI testing and treatment; and optional sections including female genital cutting and early marriage; mental health; and food insecurity. This multi-country, cross-sectional study aimed to better understand SRH prior to and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in participating countries.

Added value of this studyThis study was conducted in thirty diverse settings during a pandemic. In addition to providing needed evidence about SRH during COVID-19 across low-, middle-, and high-income countries, the study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of a new framework for global health collaboration. Using an inclusive open science approach, we were able to harmonize key sexual health variables across countries. Our use of online data collection and large reliance on convenience sampling provides both challenges and opportunities.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis multi-country study provides detailed sexual and behavioral data across diverse global settings. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 measures during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted sexual and reproductive health behaviors and access to services worldwide. In particular, our findings show a sizable proportion of people needing SRH services including HIV/STI testing and abortion reported that their access to these services was limited due to COVID-19 measures. These results suggest the need for expanded use of decentralized SRH interventions that can be implemented in emergency settings, such as self-testing, self-collection, and telemedicine.","Jennifer Toller Erausquin; Rayner K.J.

"Covid-19 as occupational disease in healthcare workers: a brief review of cases in the Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous impact on every facet of private life and work organisation in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. People who stand on the first line of defence are healthcare workers (HCWs) risking exposure to infected patients. However, even though they are often affected by COVID-19 and associated somatic and mental health problems, COVID-19 as a new illness was not immediately acknowledged as occupational disease. This is why several groups of HCWs contacted their occupational medicine physicians in 2020 with a request to register the infection with SARS-CoV-2 as occupational disease. In an attempt to support their appeals and show that hospital workers have a high occupational risk of COVID-19, this study presents COVID-19 incidence and symptoms in 100 employees working at 11 clinics of the Clinical Hospital Centre (CHC) Rijeka, Croatia from 1 June to end December 2020. All of them were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and took sick leave, which lasted 13.6Ã‚Â±2.6 days in average. This study also looks into the role of occupational medicine physicians in prospective monitoring of acute and long-acting consequences of COVID-19 that might occur in HCWs.

"Mental health over nine months during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic: Representative cross-sectional survey in twelve waves between April and December 2020 in Austria","There is accumulating evidence about detrimental impacts of the pandemic on population mental health, but knowledge on risk of groups specifically affected by the pandemic and variations across time is still limited. We surveyed approximately n=1,000 Austrian residents in 12 waves between April and December 2020 (n=12,029). Outcomes were suicidal ideation (Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale), and domestic violence. We also assessed the perceived burden from the pandemic. Demographic and Covid-19 specific occupational and morbidity-related variables were used to explain outcomes in multivariable regression analyses, controlling for well-established risk factors of mental ill-health, and variations over time were analyzed. Young age, working in healthcare or from home, and own Covid-19 illness were consistent risk factors controlling for a wide range of known mental health risk factors. Time patterns in the perceived burden from Covid-19-related measures were consistent with the time sequence of restrictions and relaxations of governmental measures. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were relatively stable over time, with some increase of depression during the second phase of lockdowns. Domestic violence increased immediately after both hard lockdowns. Suicidal ideation decreased slightly over time, with a low during the second hard lockdown. Mental health indicators for women and young people showed some deterioration over time, whereas those reporting own Covid-19 illness improved. Data from before the pandemic were not available. Among mental health outcomes, increases in domestic violence and, to some smaller extent, depressive symptoms, appeared most closely related to the timing of hard lockdowns. Healthcare staff, individuals working from home, those with Covid-19, as well as young people and women are non-traditional risk groups who warrant heightened attention in prevention during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.","Niederkrotenthaler, Laido, Kirchner, Braun, Metzler, WaldhÃƒÂ¶r, Strauss, Garcia, Till","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.153","20210929","Austria; Covid-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18428,""
"Posttraumatic growth among health care workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant mental health consequences for frontline health care workers (FHCWs). However, no known study has examined the prevalence, determinants, or correlates of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population. Data were analyzed from a prospective cohort of FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City (NYC). Assessments were conducted during the spring 2020 pandemic peak (Wave 1) and seven months later (Wave 2). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify Wave 1 sociodemographic, occupational, and psychosocial factors associated with PTG at Wave 2, and the association between aspects of PTG with burnout and pandemic-related PTSD symptoms at Wave 2. A total 76.8% of FHCWs endorsed moderate or greater PTG; the most prevalent domains were increased appreciation of life (67.0%), improved relationships (48.7%), and greater personal strength (44.1%). Non-White race/ethnicity, greater levels of positive emotions, pandemic-related PTSD symptoms, dispositional gratitude, and feelings of inspiration were independently associated with PTG. At Wave 2, endorsement of spiritual growth during the pandemic was associated with 52% and 44% lower odds of screening positive for pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and burnout, respectively; greater improvement in relationships was associated with 36% lower odds of screening positive for burnout. Single institution study and use of self-report instruments. Nearly 4-of-5 FHCWs report pandemic-related PTG, driven largely by salutogenic factors assessed during the pandemic surge. Interventions to bolster these factors may help promote PTG and mitigate risk for burnout and pandemic-related PTSD symptoms in this population.","Feingold, Hurtado, Feder, Peccoralo, Southwick, Ripp, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.032","20210929","Burnout; COVID-19; Health care workers; Posttraumatic growth; Posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18429,""
"Pandemic, Economic Uncertainty, and Protests: What Will Happen to Student Registered Nurse Anesthetists--Resiliency or Burnout?","Nurse anesthesiology education is inherently stressful, and student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs) must demonstrate a high level of resilience for successful completion. Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social unrest from racial protests, and uncertain economic conditions, SRNAs are facing unprecedented levels of stress. Additionally, traditional clinical and didactic training has been drastically interrupted, leading to feelings of anxiety and uneasiness. Much research has demonstrated that high levels of stress and anxiety can lead to burnout and mental health concerns, including fatigue, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. To prevent burnout, promote resilience, and decrease the risk of severe mental health conditions, nurse anesthesiology educational programs must explore ways to promote students' well-being, through oÃ¯Â¬â‚¬ered wellness interventions and resources.","Horvath, Grass","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pandemic,+Economic+Uncertainty,+and+Protests:+What+Will+Happen+to+Student+Registered+Nurse+Anesthetists--Resiliency+or+Burnout?","20210929","Anesthesiology; Burnout; Resiliency; Stress; student registered nurse anesthetist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18430,""

"Mental health issues and psychological risk factors among Paraguayan healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is an increasing concern regarding the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 exposure among Paraguayan healthcare workers. A cross-sectional descriptive study has been carried out in five hospitals of Paraguay. Demographic and occupational exposure to COVID-19 were collected through a short questionnaire. Mental health status was assessed with the GAD-7, the PHQ-9, and the PCL-C. Logistic regression was used to determine psychological risk factors. 432 participants were surveyed. 218 (50.46%) were physicians. The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD was 48.15, 41.90, and 5.79%, respectively. There were no significant differences in anxiety (128 [29.63%] vs. 80 [18.52%]; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3303), depression (102 [23.61%] vs. 79 [18.29%]; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.6703), or PTSD (14 [3.24%] vs. 11 [2.55%]; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8074) between frontline versus second-line workers. Main risk factors associated with psychological distress included work experience &lt;5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years for depression and a COVID-19 positive diagnosis or having family/friends with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis for PTSD. Paraguayan healthcare workers reported high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and a low prevalence of PTSD.

"Mental health and well-being impacts of COVID-19 on rural paramedics, police, community nurses and child protection workers","To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and well-being of rural paramedics, police, community nursing and child protection staff. An online survey was distributed to investigate the sources of stress and support across individual, task and organisational domains. The survey was completed by 1542 paramedics, police, community nurses and child protection workers from all states and territories of Australia. This study describes the data for the 632 rural participants. The main measures of well-being were the Public Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), workplace engagement, intention to quit and COVID-19-related stress. The mean depression and anxiety scores were 8.2 (PHQ9) and 6.8 (GAD7). This is 2-3 times that found in the general community. Over half (56.1%) of respondents showed high emotional exhaustion (burnout). The emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment mean scores were 28.5, 9.3 and 34.2, respectively. The strongest associations with burnout and psychological distress were workload, provision of practical support, training and organisational communication. A significant proportion of respondents were seriously considering quitting (27.4%) or looking for a new job with a different employer (28.5%) in the next 12Ã‚Â months. COVID-19 has increased the workload and stress on rural front-line community staff. The major sources of stress were related to organisations' responses to COVID-19 and not COVID-19 per se. The data suggest the most effective mental health interventions are practical and preventive, such as firstly ensuring fair and reasonable workloads.","Roberts, Wong, Jenkins, Neher, Sutton, O'Meara, Frost, Bamberry, Dwivedi","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajr.12804","20210929","depression; management; mental health; occupational health and safety; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18433,""

"A pilot randomised controlled trial of a guided online problem-solving intervention delivered through smartphones for secondary school pupils during the COVID-19 pandemic in India: Study protocol","'POD Adventures' is a gamified mental health intervention delivered via a smartphone app and supported by counsellors for a target population of secondary school students in India. This paper describes the protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial of a remotely-delivered version of the intervention in the context of COVID-19 restrictions. The objectives are to assess the feasibility of research procedures and intervention delivery and generate preliminary estimates of the effectiveness of the intervention to inform the sample size calculation of a full-scale trial. We will conduct a parallel, two-arm, individually randomized pilot controlled trial in 11 secondary schools in Goa, India. This pilot trial aims to recruit 70 participants with a felt need for psychological support. Participants will receive either the POD Adventures intervention delivered over 4 weeks or usual care comprising information about local mental health services and national helplines. Outcomes will be assessed at two timepoints: baseline and 6 weeks post-randomisation. The first participant was enrolled on January 28, 2021 and 6-week assessment completed on April 4, 2021. Due to a second wave of COVID-19 in India, schools in Goa were closed on April 22, 2021. Trial participants are currently receiving the intervention or completing follow-up assessments. This pilot trial will help with understanding the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a remotely-delivered, digital mental health intervention in a low-resource setting. The findings will be used to design future trials that can address difficulties of accessing psychosocial support in-person and support wider efforts to scale up evidence-based mental health interventions for young people.

"COVID shelter in place orders and mental health outcomes among college undergraduates","<b>Objective</b>The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship , if any, COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders had on mental health outcomes for undergraduate students.<b>Participants</b>This study was comprised of 138 students, all of which were recruited from a single four-year college in the Midwest.<b>Methods</b>A pre-/post-test comparative design was adopted and was leveraged to capture data regarding students' experiences before and after the shelter-in-place orders were enacted to determine if there was a marked effect between the pre-virus condition and the situation after stay at home orders went into effect.<b>Results</b>Paired sample t-test were conducted to determine whether the mental health outcomes of depression, anxiety and stress were significantly changed from before to after COVID-19 shelter in place disorders. While anxiety and stress scores were revealed no significant difference, significantly greater depression was revealed after COVID-19.<b>Conclusion</b>Overall, the results of this study highlight the need for colleges to be aware of the mental health toll that the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders may take on their students. Though this toll registered only directly in depression, there remains significant reasons to believe the situation may also affect stress and anxiety regardless of the absence of evidence for these factors in this study. There remains much to be done in assessing the ultimate impact of the pandemic on students' mental health.","Morris, Morris, Briars","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.1978459","20210929","CoVID-19; College; depression; lockdown; mental health; shelter-in-place","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18436,""
"Which is most important for mental health: Money, poverty, or paid work? A fixed-effects analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study","The relative importance of income, poverty and unemployment status for mental health is unclear, and understanding this has implications for income and welfare policy design. We aimed to assess the association between changes in these exposures and mental health. We measured effects of three transition exposures between waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study from 2010/11-2019/20 (n=38,697, obs=173,859): income decreases/increases, moving in/out of poverty, and job losses/gains. The outcome was General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), which measures likelihood of common mental disorder (CMD) as a continuous (GHQ-36) and binary measure (score Ã¢â€°Â¥4Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â case). We used fixed-effects linear and linear probability models to adjust for time invariant and time-varying confounders. To investigate effect modification, we stratified analyses by age, sex and highest education. A 10% income decrease/increase was associated with a 0.02% increase (95% CI 0.00, 0.04) and 0.01% reduction (95% CI -0.03, 0.02) in likelihood of CMD respectively. Effect sizes were larger for moving into poverty (+1.8% [0.2, 3.5]), out of poverty (-1.8%, [-3.2, -0.3]), job loss (+15.8%, [13.6, 18.0]) and job gain (-11.4%, [-14.4, -8.4]). The effect of new poverty was greater for women (+2.3% [0.8, 3.9] versus +1.2% [-1.1, 3.5] for men) but the opposite was true for job loss (+17.8% [14.4, 21.2] for men versus +13.5% [9.8, 17.2] for women). There were no clear differences by age, but those with least education experienced the largest effects from poverty transitions, especially moving out of poverty (-2.9%, [-5.7, -0.0]). Moving into unemployment was most strongly associated with CMD, with poverty also important but income effects generally much smaller. Men appear most sensitive to employment transitions, but poverty may have larger impacts on women and those with least education. As the COVID-19 pandemic recedes, minimising unemployment as well as poverty is crucial for population mental health.","Kromydas, Thomson, Pulford, Green, Katikireddi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100909","20210929","Employment; Health inequalities; Income; Mental health; Poverty; Welfare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18437,""
"Gender, work-family conflict and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among Quebec graduate students","The increasing mental health inequalities between women and men following the COVID-19 crisis represent a major public health concern. Public health measures to mitigate the pandemic could severely impact populations with high prevalence of mental health problems such as graduate students. We aimed to document the gendered experience of the lockdown and its association with depressive symptoms among graduate students in Quebec. We contrast two hypotheses: whether inequalities in depressive symptoms between women and men could be linked to their differential exposure or vulnerability to work, family and study conditions, with the mediating role of work-to-family interference (WIF) and family-to-work interference (FIW). This observational study used path analysis to test our hypotheses using a cross-sectional data collected from 1,790 graduate students from three universities in Quebec. The exposure hypothesis received more support. Women reported more stress regarding new teaching methods, which was associated directly with more depressive symptoms, and indirectly through WIF. Women were more worried about COVID-19, which was associated with more depressive symptoms, and indirectly through WIF and FIW. However, women reported less FIW and more emotional support, both respectively associated with less depressive symptoms. The policy measures taken after the COVID-19 were not gender-neutral. This study demonstrates the importance of taking the potentially gendered effects of policies into consideration, and points to mitigating actions that can forestall the exacerbation of gendered inequalities in mental health.","Bilodeau, Quesnel-VallÃƒÂ©e, Beauregard, Brault","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101568","20210929","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Gender; Inequality; Work-family conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18438,""
"Concerns and Anxieties of Patients During Hospitalization for COVID-19","Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the concerns and anxieties of hospitalized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. Methods A questionnaire was distributed to patients on discharge. The responses were analyzed once they were returned by mail. Results Responses were received from 27 of 39 patients (average age, 50 Ã‚Â± 17 years). Among the participants, 16 were male (59.3%), 19 were symptomatic (70.4%), and two required a ventilator (7.4%). Anxiety about symptom exacerbation was reported by 36.0% of participants. Quarantine-associated stress was experienced by 60.0% of participants, and 72.0% of participants supported the change in federal policy that allows asymptomatic patients and patients with mild conditions to isolate themselves at a hotel or their home. Following discharge, 44.0% of participants experienced anxieties regarding their lives after discharge, and 56.0% were anxious regarding discrimination and rumors. During hospitalization, 68.0% of participants re-evaluated their attitude toward health, 44.0% regretted the preventative measures they took before contracting COVID-19, and 44.0% felt guilty for becoming infected. Conclusions Participants experienced various kinds of stress related to hospitalization for COVID-19. There was a trend of people being more concerned about their relationships than their own health. Therefore, as asymptomatic participants and participants with mild symptoms also experienced psychological stresses, it is also necessary to consider the psychological and social effects of the disease.","Goda, Kenzaka, Yahata, Kumabe, Katsurada, Nishisaki","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.18202","20210929","anxiety; covid-19; health care providers; mental health; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18439,""
"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Among Healthcare Workers Diagnosed With COVID-19 in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2020 to 2021","Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a global problem. According to its definition, it is a disorder that occurs with some people who have undergone or witnessed a shocking, terrifying, or hazardous event, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with its consequent threats and fear meets the definition of a traumatic event. The main aim of this study is to determine PTSD in healthcare workers (HCWs) who survived COVID-19 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Subjects and methods Through an analytical cross-sectional study, HCWs working in Jeddah city with a minimum of seven days since their first positive COVID-19 result were included in this study. They were screened using the 'PTSD checklist for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)' (PCL-5), which is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Results Out of all respondents (n=404), there was slight dominance of females (54.0%) over males (46.0%), and an almost equal distribution of Saudis (51.2%) and non-Saudis (48.8%); their mean age accounted for 36.9Ã‚Â±8.7 years. PTSD was detected in 14.9%; the prevalence was significantly higher in those who had chronic diseases (23.7%), especially diabetics (30.8%) and obesity (41.2%), HCWs whose job necessitates exposure to positive cases (18.8%), and those who were isolated in hospitals while being ill. All the above values were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).Ã‚ Conclusion and recommendations The prevalence of PTSD in the HCWs who survived COVID-19 came within the range of that in HCWs who were dealing with cases of COVID-19 without being affected. Efforts should be made to alleviate stress in HCWs during their work in pandemics.","Alshehri, Alghamdi","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17371","20210929","covid 19; health care workers; healthcare workers; infectious diseases; mental health; post traumatic stress disorder; ptsd","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18440,""
"Attitude Towards COVID-19 Vaccination Among Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review","Availability and accessibility of a safe COVID-19 vaccine do not necessarily guarantee an effective means to mitigate the pandemic. However, the fragile hero's or health care worker's attitude toward the vaccine is of paramount importance to promote its acceptance. So, the current review aims to provide the latest assessment of healthcare workers' attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccination and its contributing factor worldwide. Peer-reviewed surveys in English indexed via an electronic database in Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed were systematically searched. The review was carried out per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA-2009) and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021265534). Originally 8039 articles were searched from three databases PubMed, Science direct, and Google scholar. Finally, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and made the root for the estimates of the attitude of COVID -19 vaccinations. In about two-thirds of the studies, respondents showed a positive attitude (Ã¢â€°Â¥50%) toward COVID-19 vaccination. However, in about one-quarter of the studies, a negative attitude (&lt;50%) against vaccination was reported. Factors related to the attitude of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccination include age, sex, profession, concerns about the safety of vaccines and fear of COVID-19, trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government, flu vaccination during the previous season, comorbid chronic illness, history of recommendation, and depression symptoms in the past week. Although most studies report that healthcare workers have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination, quite a few surveys mention negative attitudes towards the use of vaccines, which may reflect missed opportunities or challenges for the international efforts aimed at mitigating the pandemic. Still, we need to continue to make more efforts to change the attitudes of the uncertain healthcare workers to increase the uptake of the vaccine and deal with the multi-faceted impact of infection.","Hajure, Tariku, Bekele, Abdu, Dule, Mohammedhussein, Tsegaye","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S332792","20210929","SARS-COV-2; attitude; healthcare workers; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18441,""
"Assessment of Government Intervention Effectiveness in Scrubbing COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Pros and Cons on Educational Activities, the Case of Dire Dawa City","Coronaviruses are known as a large family of viruses known to cause respiratory infections which are considered as a pandemic by WHO and widely distributed all over the globe; causing several damages to all aspects of human being's life. To assess and identify the determinants of government intervention effectiveness in scrubbing COVID-19 and its pros and cons on educational activity in Dire Dawa City. Stratified random sampling was hired to draw a sample of teachers from a list of teachers that were taught at both selected private and public educational institutes. A 57.6% of educators responded as the government was effective in mitigating the pandemic. Out of 250 educators, 9.6%, 10.8%, 8.4%, 38.4%, and 32.8% were reported that they have very poor, poor, neutral, good, and very good level of knowledge about COVID-19, respectively. The respondents' perceptions about the pandemic were rated as not very fear inducing, not fear inducing, neutral, fear inducing, and very fear inducing 3.2%, 6.4%, 6.8%, 55.2% and 28.4%, respectively. Logistic regression indicates nine predictors were significant: avoiding touching one's body with unwashed hands, disinfecting surfaces, fatigue, getting flu vaccine, individual limitation in cooperating to cease the disease, how to maintain one's mental health during the isolation, and washing for at least 20 seconds, family care, and self-isolation. Reading, family care, watching movies and physical exercise were importance brought by the pandemic to the educators. Teachers are obligated to stay at home, unemployment, stress, unable to conduct professional activities, cancellation of training, and loss of motivation. The results implied us eighty-four variables were significantly associated with government intervention effectiveness, and nine predictors were significantly related with the government's intervention effectiveness in halting the pandemic from logistic regression model.","Tesfaye Yifru, Yazie Derso, Zewdie Shibeshi","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S322665","20210929","COVID-19 pandemic; educational activities; effectiveness; government; interventions; physical distancing; pros and cons; quarantine; schools; stay at home; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18442,""
"Mediation of Mothers' Anxiety and Parenting in Children's Behavior Problems during COVID-19","The outbreak of COVID-19 is affecting the lives of millions of families around the world. The current study was carried out in Israel, following the pandemic's initial outbreak and during the resulting enforced quarantine, confining parents and children to their homes. A sample of 141 Israeli mothers with at least one child between the ages of 3 and 12 (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.92, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.55) participated as volunteers. About half the sample (50.7%) consisted of girls. Most mothers were cohabiting with a spouse (93%). Mothers completed online questionnaires about their perceptions about the health and economic threats of COVID-19, availability of social support, their anxiety symptoms, hostile/coercive and supportive/engaged parenting behavior, and their children's behavior problems. Results showed expected significant associations between the mothers' reports about having little social support, their anxiety symptoms, hostile/coercive and supportive/engaged parenting behavior, and children's externalizing problems. Likewise, expected significant associations were found between mothers' perceptions about the health and economic threats of COVID-19, their anxiety symptoms, hostile/coercive parenting behavior, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Importantly, maternal anxiety and hostile/coercive parenting behavior mediated the associations between lack of support, negative perceptions about the health and economic threats of COVID-19, and children's behavior problems. These findings stress the importance of mothers' mental health and parenting behaviors for children's socioemotional adaptation in the context of COVID-19. Implications of the findings for family interventions intended to help parents and children at this time are suggested.","Hanetz-Gamliel, Levy, Dollberg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-021-02115-x","20210929","COVID-19; Child behavior problems; Maternal behavior; MotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anxiety; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18443,""
"Tele-Case Work Consultation to Woman Survivor of Domestic Violence During COVID 19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 have resulted in social isolation, reduced social support system, and increased domestic violence (DV) cases against women and children. The governments and NGOs have taken several measures to prevent DV by starting helpline, WhatsApp numbers, and counseling services during the lockdown to safeguard the women. This paper describes a case scenario of how we offered tele-case work consultation during the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the procedure adopted, and preventive measures followed while providing a tailor-made psychosocial intervention to a DV survivor. It also discusses the strengths and challenges while offering tele-consultation and possible steps to overcome the technological barriers to mental health professionals.","Vranda","https://doi.org/10.1177/02537176211035696","20210929","COVID-19; Domestic; tele-case work; violence; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18444,""
"Delay discounting and under-valuing of recent information predict poorer adherence to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented global changes in individual and collective behaviour. To reduce the spread of the virus, public health bodies have promoted social distancing measures while attempting to mitigate their mental health consequences. The current study aimed to identify cognitive predictors of social distancing adherence and mental health symptoms, using computational models derived from delay discounting (the preference for smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards) and patch foraging (the ability to trade-off between exploiting a known resource and exploring an unknown one). In a representative sample of the UK population (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°442), we find that steeper delay discounting predicted poorer adherence to social distancing measures and greater sensitivity to reward magnitude during delay discounting predicted higher levels of anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, under-valuing recently sampled information during foraging independently predicted greater violation of lockdown guidance. Our results suggest that those who show greater discounting of delayed rewards struggle to maintain social distancing. Further, those who adapt faster to new information are better equipped to change their behaviour in response to public health measures. These findings can inform interventions that seek to increase compliance with social distancing measures whilst minimising negative repercussions for mental health.","Lloyd, McKay, Hartman, Vincent, Murphy, Gibson-Miller, Levita, Bennett, McBride, Martinez, Stocks, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Hyland, Karatzias, Butter, Shevlin, Bentall, Mason","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98772-5","20210929","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18445,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on telepsychiatry at the service and individual patient level across two UK NHS mental health Trusts","The effects of COVID-19 on the shift to remote consultations remain to be properly investigated. To quantify the extent, nature and clinical impact of the use of telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it with the data in the same period of the 2 years before the outbreak. We used deidentified electronic health records routinely collected from two UK mental health Foundation Trusts (Oxford Health (OHFT) and Southern Health (SHFT)) between January and September in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We considered three outcomes: (1) service activity, (2) in-person versus remote modalities of consultation and (3) clinical outcomes using Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) data. HoNOS data were collected from two cohorts of patients (cohort 1: patients with Ã¢â€°Â¥1 HoNOS assessment each year in 2018, 2019 and 2020; cohort 2: patients with Ã¢â€°Â¥1 HoNOS assessment each year in 2019 and 2020), and analysed in clusters using superclasses (namely, psychotic, non-psychotic and organic), which are used to assess overall healthcare complexity in the National Health Service. All statistical analyses were done in Python. Mental health service activity in 2020 increased in all scheduled community appointments (by 15.4% and 5.6% in OHFT and SHFT, respectively). Remote consultations registered a 3.5-fold to 6-fold increase from February to June 2020 (from 4685 to a peak of 26Ã¢â‚¬â€°245 appointments in OHFT and from 7117 to 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°987 appointments in SHFT), with post-lockdown monthly averages of 23Ã¢â‚¬â€°030 and 22Ã¢â‚¬â€°977 remote appointments/month in OHFT and SHFT, respectively. Video consultations comprised up to one-third of total telepsychiatric services per month from April to September 2020. For patients with dementia, non-attendance rates at in-person appointments were higher than remote appointments (17.2% vs 3.9%). The overall HoNOS cluster value increased only in the organic superclass (clusters 18-21, n=174; p&lt;0.001) from 2019 to 2020, suggesting a specific impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population of patients. The rapid shift to remote service delivery has not reached some groups of patients who may require more tailored management with telepsychiatry.","Hong, Sheriff, Smith, Tomlinson, Saad, Smith, Engelthaler, Phiri, Henshall, Ede, Denis, Mitter, D'Agostino, Cerveri, Tomassi, Rathod, Broughton, Marlowe, Geddes, Cipriani","https://doi.org/10.1136/ebmental-2021-300287","20210929","adult psychiatry; delirium &amp; cognitive disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; eating disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18446,""
"Effect of COVID-19 on mental health among the young population in Lebanon","COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has raised worldwide public health concerns. The wide spread of the virus has led to unprecedented disturbance to regular life for people around the globe and impacted their mental health. The aims of the current study were to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms related to insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and identify risk factors contributing to psychological stress in Lebanese young population during COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was done on the Lebanese young population. Participants were 4397 males and females aged 18 to 35 years who filled a self-administered online questionnaire. Three validated scales were used to measure the mental health status of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic: 7-item Insomnia Severity Index for insomnia, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression module for depression, and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale for anxiety. The median interquartile range scores for anxiety, insomnia, and depression, were 8 (4-13), 10 (5-14), and 9 (5-12) respectively. Higher anxiety scores were reported with female gender (P&lt;0.001) and alcohol usage (P=0.04). Moderate to severe insomnia was associated with single (P=0.02) and divorced marital status (P=0.003), university education (P&lt;0.001), consumption of caffeinated beverages (P=0.02) and energy drinks (P=0.03). Higher depression scores were associated with status of being the only person working at home (P=0.01), family income more than 500 USD (P=0.008), multiple insurance plans (P=0.01), and contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case (P=0.01).

"Functional Impairments in the Mental Health, Depression and Anxiety Related to the Viral Epidemic, and Disruption in Healthcare Service Utilization Among Cancer Patients in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era","Literature is scarce regarding cancer care utilization during the massive outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Republic of Korea. We investigated functional impairments in mental health and their relationships with depression, anxiety regarding the viral epidemic, and disruptions in healthcare service utilization among cancer patients in the COVID-19 pandemic era. We used an online survey with questions related to the disturbances faced by patients with cancer in utilizing healthcare services in the pandemic era. Current mental health status was assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 6 (SAVE-6) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), Cancer-related Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep scale (C-DBS), and Fear of COVID-19 over Cancer (FCC). Among the 221 responders, 95 (43.0%) reported disturbances in utilizing hospital care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analysis revealed that functional impairment in the mental health of these patients was expected due to disturbances in healthcare service utilization, high levels of depression, anxiety regarding the viral epidemic, fear of COVID over cancer, and low resilience. Mediation analysis showed that patient resilience and cancer-related dysfunctional beliefs about sleep partially mediated the effects of anxiety on functional impairment. In this pandemic era, patients with cancer experience depression, anxiety regarding the viral epidemic, and disruptions in healthcare service utilization, which may influence their functional impairments in mental health.","Kim, Kim, Lee, Cho, Ahn, Son, Kim, Kim, Yoon, Kim, Kwon, Kim, Koh, Seo, Chung","https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2021.585","20210929","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cancer care facilities; Depression; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18449,""
"Mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation among unpaid caregivers of adults in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: Relationships to age, race/ethnicity, employment, and caregiver intensity","Background Unpaid caregivers of adults play critical roles in health care systems by providing care to older adults and those with chronic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened caregiving needs, forcing some into caregiving roles and disrupting others. We sought to estimate the prevalence of and identify factors associated with adverse mental health symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation amongst unpaid caregivers of adults versus non-caregivers. Methods During June 24-30, 2020, surveys were administered to U.S. adults. Quota sampling and survey weighting were implemented to improve sample representativeness of age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Results Of 9,896 eligible invited adults, 5,412 (54.7%) completed surveys and 5,011 (92.6%) met screening criteria and were analyzed, including 1,362 (27.2%) caregivers. Caregivers had higher adverse mental health symptom prevalences than non-caregivers, including suicidal ideation (33.4% vs 3.7%, pÂ <Â 0.0001). Symptoms were more common among caregivers who were young vs older adults (e.g., aged 18â€“24 vs =65 years, aPR 2.75, 95% CI 1.95â€“3.88, pÂ <Â 0.0001) and with moderate and high vs low Caregiver Intensity Index scores (2.31, 1.65â€“3.23; 2.81, 2.00â€“3.94; both pÂ <Â 0.0001). Limitations Self-report data may be subject to recall, response, and social desirability biases; unpaid caregivers were self-identified; child caregiving roles were not assessed; and internet-based survey samples might not fully represent the U.S. population. Conclusions Caregivers experienced disproportionately high levels of adverse mental health symptoms. Younger caregivers and those with higher caregiving intensity were disproportionately affected. Increased visibility of and access to mental health care resources are urgently needed to address mental health challenges of caregiving.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.130","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","",18450,""
