"HOW DO WE PROVIDE WOMEN-CENTRED CARE FOR THE ONE-IN-FIVE WOMEN WHO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION? 2 CHALLENGES AND NEXT STEPS","The Scottish Government released the Mental Health Strategy to improve mental health services. With one-in-five pregnant women being identified as having a mental health condition, it is a prevalent issue for midwives. There are obstacles in midwifery to being able to meet the expectations of the aims of the Mental Health Strategy. These include accessing services, mental health stigma, organisational challenges, training and the impact of COVID-19. Solutions such as The Best Start and continuity of care within midwifery, appropriate referral process, training and education, and increased awareness can help midwives achieve the Scottish Government's aims. This is the final article in the series.","Weir, Clare","https://doi.org/10.55975/YEKU6462","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Practising Midwife; 25(8):20-24, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",37995,""

"VALIDATION OF CES-D8 AMONG CZECH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Objectives. Due to the rise of depressive symptomatology especially among vulnerable populations such as young adults during the COVID-19 outbreak, a reliable measuring tool is needed. Because of the lack of such studies, the authors decided to validate the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 8) among Czech university students capturing the beginning of lockdown experience. Statistical analyses. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted and structural equation modelling with diagonally weighted least squares estimation using lavaan was employed. Different hypotheses about the dimensionality of the CES-D 8 scale were tested. The authors assessed the measurement equivalence of the CES-D 8 scale according to gender using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. The effect of sociodemographic and COVID-19 issues variables on depression was examined. Results. One dimensional model with correlated errors showed sufficient validity and therefore, the best fit. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis results revealed that the factor structure is invariant across gender. Women and those who reported financial distress and academic stress showed a higher level of depressive symptomatology. On the other hand, relationships proved to have a protective effect. Limitations. The sample came from an online survey, respondents were self-selected. There was a gender imbalance in the sample that cannot be explained by a higher number of women in the Czech university environment. Conclusions. The CES-D 8 proved to be a useful instrument for measuring depressed mood that opens further possibilities for depression research in the university environment and during pandemic situations.

"Quality of life of cancer patients during the COVID -19 pandemic: narrative review","The rapidly spreading of COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of people,s daily lives around the world. It has negative impact on society, a matter of great concern, especially for cancer patients. They are at increased risk of complications and mortality from coronavirus infection due to cancer and its treatment. Alongside the clinical risk, attention should be also paid to the psychological risks of the pandemic, especially regarding the increase in emotional stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness in patients. To date, there are only a limited number of studies examining the potential psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients. This narrative review synthesizes available findings including pandemic barriers to cancer care, as well as pandemic concerns and their subsequent psychosocial impact on quality of life in a particularly high-risk group of cancer patients. It highlights some of the care options for patients during the current pandemic, that can be used in case of future pandemics or in the post-pandemic period. An overview of these findings can provide a closer look of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life of cancer patients and provide a better understanding of their concerns and overall well-being.

"Trauma-Informed Public Management: A Step Toward Addressing Hidden Inequalities and Improving Employee Wellbeing","Public management practices that take a holistic approach are increasingly necessary;trauma-informed care, when embedded within public service, recognizes histories, experiences, and emotions of individuals. Many public servants experience vicarious trauma, by the very nature of their work, and there is a need to recognize this reality and use tools and techniques that are appropriately trauma-informed. Many organizations utilize trauma-informed care principles to engage with clients or citizens in arenas like social work, mental health, or addiction care, yet fewer organizations take a traumainformed approach with their own employees to provide a safe and supportive workplace. Trauma-informed public management, conceptualized as embedding the six principles of trauma-informed practices into an organizational ethos, represents an opportunity to center the affective needs of public and nonprofit employees and managers who often bring their own traumatic experiences with them to their role and/or experience vicarious trauma in their jobs. The authors use applied examples from public sector responses to the COVID-19 pandemic - a prolonged and traumatic experience shared by public servants and citizens alike - to demonstrate these six principles and outline how trauma-informed techniques can be implemented now to benefit the public sector workforce.","Miller, Annie, Trochmann, Maren B.; Drury, Ida","https://doi.org/10.37808/paq.46.3.3","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Administration Quarterly; 46(3):238-257, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38000,""
"The Effect of a Yoga Intervention on Physical and Psychological Outcomes in Patients on Chronic Hemodialysis","Studies have found that yoga may be beneficial to patients with chronic diseases by improving physical functioning, cardiovascular risk factors, and mood disorders. To date, minimal research has been conducted on the benefits of yoga in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Yoga utilizes postures, breathing, and meditation to help focus the mind and engage the body in low-to-moderate physical activity. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a chair yoga study and compare the effects of a four-week chair yoga intervention on psychological and physiological outcomes in a sample of 31 patients on chronic hemodialysis. At study completion, the chair yoga group had significantly lower depression and anxiety scores, and diastolic blood pressure than the standard care group. This study demonstrated the difficulty in recruiting participants for yoga studies. Future studies with larger sample sizes and over longer durations of time should be conducted to further validate findings. In addition, further exploration of interventions to promote motivation in this population to participate in similar low-intensity exercises needs to be conducted.","Kauric-Klein, Zorica PhD Aprn- B.

It based on a series of qualitative interviews conducted with workers and experts as part of a longitudinal study in 2020â€“2021 in the Ulyanovsk region. We focus on three key aspects: quarantine, mask wearing and vaccination, showing the attitudes of workers towards these measures, the degree of their acceptance or resistance to them. We conclude that restrictions were largely ineffective, but they allowed employers to increase control over staff and led to violations of labor rights. Coercion rather than persuasion served as the primary tool for promoting anti-COVID measures. The workers did not relate the implementation of these measures to occupational safety or management's concern about their health, but expressed a growing feeling of powerlessness. Anti-COVID restrictions are perceived to have reduced staff cohesion and caused conflicts between workers and management. Informants criticized both the content of the measures and the non-systemic manner of their implementation. The paper traces how long the anti-COVID measures lasted, and what were the reasons for their cancellation.Alternate

"Razlike u percipiranome temperamentu dojenceta, povezivanju s dojencetom i mentalnom zdravlju izmedu majki koje doje i onih koje ne doje","Dojenje je povezano s raznim zdravstvenim blagodatima za majku i dijete, stoga krovne zdravstvene organizacije preporucuju dojenje najmanje do navrÅ¡enih 6 mjeseci. S obzirom na nedosljedne rezultate u literaturi, cilj je ovoga istraÅ¾ivanja bio ispitati razlike izmeÃ°u majki koje doje i onih koje hrane djecu nadomjesnim mlijekom u nekim sociodemografskim i opstetrickim cimbenicima, percipiranom temperamentu dojenceta, kvaliteti povezivanja majke s djetetom te mentalnom zdravlju (depresivnosti, anksioznosti, stresu). TakoÃ°er, htjeli smo provjeriti koliko ispitivane varijable pridonose objaÅ¡njenju varijance nacina prehrane dojenceta. Majke (N = 284) dojencadi u dobi do Å¡est mjeseci ispunile su upitnike u online istraÅ¾ivanju. KoriÅ¡teni su Upitnik karakteristika dojenceta (ICQ), EdinburÅ¡ki upitnik poslijeporoÃ°ajne depresivnosti (EPDS), Upitnik depresije, anksioznosti i stresa (ljestvice anksioznost i stres;DASS-21), Upitnik povezivanja nakon poroÃ°aja (PBQ) te upitnik opcih podataka. Rezultati su pokazali da su majke koje doje viÅ¡eg obrazovanja, izvjeÅ¡tavale su o niÅ¾oj stopi hitnoga carskog reza te su poroÃ°aj rjeÃ°e procjenjivale traumaticnim. Majke koje doje svoju su dojencad percipirale viÅ¡e neprilagodljivima i nepredvidivima. Nije pronaÃ°ena znacajna razlika u ostalim sociodemografskim i opstetrickim karakteristikama, kvaliteti povezivanja s dojencetom, kao ni u mentalnom zdravlju izmeÃ°u majki koje doje i onih koje ne doje. Regresijska analiza pokazala je da dojenju znacajno pridonosi viÅ¡e obrazovanje majke, niÅ¾a stopa traumaticnoga iskustva poroÃ°aja te neprilagodljivi temperament dojenceta. Rezultati ukazuju na potrebu formiranja dodatne podrÅ¡ke dojenju kod majki koje su imale poroÃ°aj hitnim carskim rezom ili koje su poroÃ°aj doÅ¾ivjele traumaticnim. TakoÃ°er, majke dojilje potrebno je podrÅ¾ati u uspostavi predvidljivije rutine hranjenja i pristupanju dojencetu s teÅ¾im temperamentom.Alternate :Breastfeeding is associated with numerous health benefits for the mother and the child. Therefore, global health organizations recommend exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first six months of an infant's life. Considering the inconsistent results within the literature, this study aimed to examine the differences between breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mothers in sociodemographic and obstetric factors, perceived infant temperament, quality of mother-infant bonding and maternal mental health (depression, anxiety, stress). We also wanted to explore how much these variables contribute to the variance of the infant feeding method. The online study involved 284 mothers of infants up to the age of six months. The following questionnaires were used: Questionnaire (ICQ);Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS);Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21;Anxiety and Stress subscales);Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ), and the general data questionnaire. The results showed that breastfeeding mothers had higher education, had less frequently emergency caesarean sections, and evaluated their childbirth as a traumatic experience less often. Also, breastfeeding mothers reported significantly more unadaptable and unpredictable temperament of their infants. However, there was no significant difference between breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mothers in other sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, bonding or mental health. Higher education, non-traumatic childbirth and more unadaptable infant temperament contribute to explaining breastfeeding. The findings suggest the need for breastfeeding support for mothers who had an emergency caesarean section or a traumatic birth experience. Moreover, breastfeeding mothers need adequate help establishing a more predictable feeding routine and the optimal approach to the infant with a difficult temperament.","VukÅ¡ic, Nikolina, Å½utic, Maja, RadoÅ¡, Sandra Nakic","https://doi.org/10.31820/pt.31.2.8","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychological Topics; 31(2):359-381, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38003,""
"Men's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","Background: Mental health issues can be more severe in men vulnerable to isolation and loneliness during a pandemic because of social distancing and isolation measures. The purpose of this study was to identify current research trends and the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on men's mental health through a scoping review, and to make recommendations for improvements. Methods: This study conducted a scoping review to explore and analyze research trends on the effect of COVID-19 on men's mental health during the period January 2020 to October 2021. The PubMed and CINAHL databases, as well as Google Scholar, were used to identify relevant studies. The two researchers individually reviewed the studies, and all references were reviewed to determine the final sample of included studies. Results: A total of 27 studies were included in the analysis. Of all the studies, 14 were descriptive, one was quasi-experimental, and six were qualitative. Remaining studies included four commentaries, one case study, and one review. COVID-19 was found to impact the following areas of men's mental health at the individual level: psychological distress, addictive behaviors, sleep, well-being, cognitive function, and coping. At the interpersonal level, family outcomes, community belonging, and violence were impacted. At the social level, masculinity, inequity, and social service changes were affected. Intervention strategies for men's mental health during COVID-19 recommended by these studies were also divided into three levels (individual, interpersonal, and social level). Conclusions: Efforts should be made to improve mental health services for men who may experience anxiety, depression, and anger, along with the physical health concerns of the COVID-19 era.","Yu, Soyoung, Park, Hyunbong","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jomh1809179","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Men's Health; 18(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38004,""
"Healthcare Professionals and Telehealth Usability during COVID-19","Objective: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many other health providers needed to rapidly adopt telehealth services to ensure continuity of patient care, without the opportunity to extensively evaluate the usability of the adopted technology. Therefore, this study aims to examine health professionalsâ€™ telehealth usability during COVID-19 in Florida. Design: This cross-sectional study employed the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) to licensed healthcare providers in Florida in June 2020. Setting and Participants: A total of 399,660 selected health professionals with Florida licensure were recruited from open-access Florida healthcare to participate in a Qualtrics web-based survey. A total of 1,868 health professionals completed the survey. Multiple linear and mixed regression models were applied to analyze the overall and subdomain scores from TUQ. Main Outcome Measures: Telehealth usability. Results: The analysis of the overall TUQ score showed younger, female healthcare professionals, and participants who reported an increase in telehealth usage during pandemic had a significantly higher overall TUQ score. Compared with the score from physicians and nurses, the scores from the mental health group and social work group were significantly higher, while the score rehabilitation group was significantly lower. Analysis of the subdomain scores was consistent with the overall scores. Conclusion: The findings from this study indicate that the health professionalsâ€™ telehealth usability is related to age, gender, and the change of telehealth usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. While pandemics represent only one possible impetus for the healthcare system to swiftly switch to telehealth platforms, each profession should consider providing adequate resources to accommodate the need for change.","Xu, Jing, Hamadi, Hanadi Y.; Hicks-Roof, Kristen K.; Zeglin, Robert J.; Bailey, Chloe E.; Zhao, Mei","https://doi.org/10.30953/tmt.v6.270","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Telehealth and Medicine Today; 6(3), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38005,""

"Telepsychiatry During the COVID Pandemic: Reflection from India","Introduction: Recent advancements in information technology and access to smartphone have expanded the scope of healthcare delivery services across the globe. Telemedicine is making healthcare affordable and more accessible to the needy in situations like the present pandemic. Although telepsychiatry services were underutilised initially in India due to various barriers, its role in delivering healthcare services, has gained pace since the last few years. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, India introduced telemedicine practice guidelines (March, 2020), and telepsychiatry operational guidelines (May, 2020), to remove barriers and promote equitable access. In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic various mental health institutes across India relied heavily upon telepsychiatry services to provide care. National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore being an Institute of National Importance has introduced different modules to provide clinical care to the mentally ill. Objectives: In this article, the authors provide an experiential account of various clinical services provided by our institute through telepsychiatry means across India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: These clinical service modules have tremendous potential to increase the use of technology in providing quality care to the unreached population, bridging the treatment gap for psychiatric disorders globally and developing countries in particular.","Suchandra, Harihara, Damodaran, Dinakaran, Malathesh, Barikar C.; Lakshmi, Nirisha P.; Narayana, Manjunatha, Kumar, C.

"Neurology and Telemedicine: The Way Forward","Objective: During the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) times, we have all learned to appreciate the advantages of communicating with each other on the digital or virtual format. This included both social, commercial and professional settings. This was necessitated through the restrictions on direct physical contact mandated by the pandemic. Through innovations and adaptations, the practice of medicine has also changed with telemedicine, triggered by â€˜necessity is the mother of inventionâ€™ concept being embraced by both patients and physicians. Neurology, traditionally seen as a complex speciality and the preserve of a couple of thousand practising neurologists in the country, has opened itself up to the telemedicine or tele-neurology format very easily in the anecdotal and a few pilot studies conducted globally and in India. Design: Despite the initial misgivings and anticipation of patient reluctance to adopt this technology, the real-world experience has been, to the contrary, where both young and old patients have readily embraced the new medium and cooperated with the neurologists to improve their care, which would otherwise have been severely restricted in the COVID-19 times. The neurologists have also adapted to the new way of working to deliver optimum diagnosis and care plans. Outcome measures: There have been technical glitches (in form of internet connectivity, smartphone hardware and software problems and lighting and camera angle and image stabilization issues to name a few), which have been reduced with practice and innovation. Feedback from neurologists, patients, and their carers via regular audits and questionnaires are being circulated, and practice parameters are being improved (IFNR survey- Ref 5). The contribution of national regulatory agencies, such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), and stakeholders, such as the Telemedicine Society of India (TSI), has been phenomenal to facilitate the tele-neurology practice and make it safe for all stakeholders. Results: In a country of 1.37 billion population and only 2,500 accredited neurologists, there is a need for tele-neurology to be able to serve patients living in remote areas in mountains and coastal areas, and also in poorly connected areas on the plains. This becomes paramount for patients requiring specialised acute neurological care and to improve access, which now becomes a practical feasibility on the digital format to bring neurology to the doorsteps of the people. Follow-up care of patients, epidemiological studies of various neurological chronic illnesses and their audit will become realities cutting down on costs and time to access quality neurological care using the digital format for 21st-century India. Conclusions: Tele-neurology is no longer a vision, but a reality precipitated by the pandemic, the needs and aspirations of the Indian population, and the technological infrastructure India has achieved in the last 20 years.","Ray, Partha S.; Surya, Nirmal","https://doi.org/10.30953/tmt.v6.260","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Telehealth and Medicine Today; 6(2), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38009,""
"VA Video Telehealth and Training Programs During the COVID-19 Response","Objective: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has a robust telehealth program supported by a training infrastructure for VA clinicians and staff. In fiscal 2019, over 909,000 VA patients received a portion of their VA care through telehealth, and over 60% of VAâ€™s primary and mental health care providers participated in one or more Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT) appointments to a patientâ€™s home. In March 2020, during the initial spread of COVID-19, Veterans Health Administration leadership issued guidance for providers to transition from in-person care to virtual modalities for routine care not requiring a physical encounter. VAâ€™s comprehensive training infrastructure helped providers quickly become capable of delivering CVT care to meet the needs of their patients, and the VA Office of Connected Care Quality and Training (QT) Division adjusted the program as providersâ€™ needs evolved. Design: As clinical staff faced new and increasing demands to respond to needs during the pandemic, the QT Division streamlined existing training programs to deliver essential content and enable providers to acquire necessary telehealth skills more quickly. This included reducing the number of core courses required to become telehealth-capable from four to two by introducing an integrated course. The QT Division reorganized and edited content from other accredited courses to convey key topics. To shorten courses for providers with full schedules, the QT Division removed accreditation from some courses, such as the COVID-19 VA Video Connect for Providers course. Results: The QT Divisionâ€™s pandemic response resulted in over 80,000 new course completions in the first month and over 20% more primary care and mental health providers conducting CVT visits in the first five months. During this period, the number of CVT appointments increased by over 1,000%. Conclusion: VAâ€™s telehealth training infrastructure, implemented by the QT Division, enabled VA to enter the COVID-19 public health emergency fully prepared for the rapid growth in telehealth care. As CVT became increasingly important during the COVID-19 response, the QT Division made necessary curriculum adjustments to meet provider and patient needs. ____________________________________________________________________________ Fireside Chat with Authors Moderator: Lyle Berkowitz, MD, FACP, FHIMSS, Editor-in-Chief, Telehealth and Medicine Today","Johnston, Rhonda, Kobb, Rita F.; Marty, Claire, McVeigh, Padraic","https://doi.org/10.30953/tmt.v6.241","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Telehealth and Medicine Today; 6(1), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38010,""
"DEVELOPMENT OF CONDITIONS FOR ANALYTICAL DIAGNOSIS OF POISONING WITH CLOPIDOGREL","Introduction. Clopidogrel bisulfate (Clopidogrel) is one of the main drugs for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases (acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, etc.). Especially, this drug is very relevant in the treatment of COVID-19. Clopidogrel has repeatedly been the cause of lethal poisoning, and cases of clopidogrel being used for suicide are very common in China. According to the studied literature data, the analysis of this drug in the biological material is not presented. Objective: The aim of the research was to establish the distinctive ability of conventional methods of isolating medicinal substances from biological material in relation to clopidogrel in chemical and toxicological analysis (CTA). Material and methods. The study was carried out with model samples of pig liver that had not undergone putrefactive changes, which contained the studied drug. Detection and quantification of clopidogrel in extracts were carried out using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and UV spectrophotometry. Results. The isolation efficiency of clopidogrel according to the method of A.A. Vasilyeva was 57.75Â±5.08%, according to the method of V.P. Kramarenko â€“ 64.23Â±5.44%. When using the isolation method of A.A. Vasilyeva, the detection limit of clopidogrel was 1.04%, according to the method of V.P. Kramarenko â€“ 1.09%. The limit of quantitative determination of clopidogrel according to the method of A.A. Vasilyeva is 3.31%, according to the method of V.P. Kramarenko â€“ 3.34%, respectively. Conclusion. For analytical diagnostics in case of clopidogrel poisoning, TLC screening and UV spectrophotometric determination must be carried out with preliminary TLC purification. Isolation of clopidogrel with water acidified with ethyl alcohol (the Stas-Otto method) does not work. The effectiveness of isolating the drug by the method of V.P. Kramarenko is 64.23Â±5.44%. The greatest selectivity of the UV spectrophotometric method for determining clopidogrel in biological material in relation to matrix components was provided by the method of isolation with water acidified with sulfuric acid (V.P. Kramarenko's method).

"Mental Health Problems during COVID-19 Pandemic","Mental health is essential to achieving a comprehensive degree of health, but it has not become a top priority in some developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for people to access physical and mental health services. The situation of this pandemic pushes WHO and mental health services as an integral component of the condition. Only a third of healthcare providers in the United States can receive standardized mental health care. In developing countries with low and middle incomes, 75% more people experience neurological disorders, mental disorders, and addictive substance abuse. The prevalence of patients affected by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is around 4-41%, and the prevalence of major depression due to the epidemic - increased by 7%. Unfortunately, of those with mental disorders, only a tiny percentage get proper treatment.","Achmad Yasin, Mustamin, Pratama, Yanasta Yudo, Tri, Ani Marwati","https://doi.org/10.26555/eshr.v4i2.5814","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Epidemiology and Society Health Review; 4(2):87-88, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38012,""

"Psychological Reaction of Teachers in the Context of the Covid Pandemic 19","The Covid 19 pandemic, is a period with a strong impact in all areas of the families, their social, economic, political and educational life. The rules and sanitary measures to prevent the spread of the pandemic, the educational policies, as well as the isolation, quarantine of some teachers, imposed the transition from classical education to online one. This transition, and also the need for digitalization, have led to major changes in teaching activity and implicitly have affected the well-being of teachers. The present study investigates the psychological reactions of 73 teachers as well as the effectiveness of a psychological intervention applied to 15 teachers, who showed severe psychological reactions during the pandemic period. The motivation of the study derives from the need to offer quick methods and techniques for managing the emotional states they went through. The psychological intervention model presented in the article, aims to reduce the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression that teachers experience during a pandemic situations, and also to help them apply psychological intervention techniques to regain their well-being).

"Comparing Childbirth Experience Between Induced and Spontaneous Labour During Covid-19 Pandemic","Introduction: Every pregnant mother has a different expectation on each laboring experience and would want to imagine a pleasant journey about giving birth. A good childbirth experience boosts self-confidence, self-worth and feeling accomplishment. A bad childbirth experience leads to postpartum depression, fear of childbirth and some even experience post-traumatic stress disorder. Induction of labour (IOL) is a common procedure in obstetrics practice, done prior to onset of labour using mechanical or pharmacological methods. This questionnaire-based study was planned in order to improve our approach and service in making women more comfortable during the childbirth process albeit spontaneously or through IOL. Objective: To compare childbirth experience among induced labour and spontaneous labour and to evaluate their contributing factors. Methods: This was a cross sectional study where questionnaire was distributed to all postpartum women who had delivered in Hospital Cansellor Tuanku Muhriz who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. Suitable participants were identified at postnatal ward just after delivery. Results: A total of 314 women were recruited. Study showed no significant labour experiences difference among both IOL and spontaneous labour groups. Overall, both spontaneous and IOL groups had positive childbirth experience. Age, ethnicity body mass index labour analgesia and indication of IOL has influence in childbirth experiences. Conclusion: Childbirth experiences were comparably positive in both groups possibly due to patients understanding of labour process and healthcare factors.","Sinnasamy, Dhivya Nayar, Ismail, Nor Azlin Mohamed, Rahman, Rahana Abd, Kalok, Aida Hani Mohd, Ahmad, Shuhaila, Syah, Shamsul Azhar","https://doi.org/10.17576/MH.2022.s1702","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicine & Health (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia); 17:8-8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38015,""

"Lack of policy consideration for breastfeeding co-mothers in maternity services","This article reports on two cases of lesbian non-gestational mothers whose breastfeeding intentions were disrupted by the postnatal ward visitor restrictions imposed by NHS trusts during the COVID-19 lockdowns in the UK. One case came to the attention of the author as part of a wider study using an online survey to examine experiences of birth during the first COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020. In the second case, the author was approached by the non-gestational mother for support in her capacity as a doula in April 2021. In both cases, the non-gestational mothers intended to breastfeed their babies and had taken steps to ensure they were lactating, but the heterosexist restrictions for partners in the early postnatal period created complications that impacted their breastfeeding intentions. In the second case, perinatal mental health care for previous birth trauma was also potentially indicated. Both non-gestational mothers also reported that they were not receiving antenatal support to overcome these difficulties, as they were mothers-to-be who were not pregnant.","Greenfield, Mari","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjom.2022.30.9.526","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Midwifery; 30(9):526-530, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38017,""
"Knowledge of Public Environmental Health with Covid-19 Prevention Behavior at the Jalan Gedang Public Health Center Bengkulu City","Background: The highest spread of Covid-19 cases in 9 sub-districts in Bengkulu City was Gading Cempaka District, with 86 positive cases, 46 recovered, and 3 died. People do not comply with health and personal hygiene protocols such as washing hands and using masks, do not behave in a healthy life, and lack public awareness in maintaining environmental cleanliness. In addition, the community still litters in several places and lacks knowledge and understanding of clean water and household waste management properly. This study aimed to determine the relationship between public environmental health knowledge and Covid-19 prevention behavior in the Working Area of <U+200B><U+200B>Jalan Gedang Health Center, Bengkulu City. Method: The design used in this research is quantitative research using a cross-sectional approach. This research took place in the area of <U+200B><U+200B>Jalan Gedang Health Center, Bengkulu City.

"Psychological impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on health professions students at the University of Zambia: a cross-sectional study","Introduction: the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively impacted the mental health of students across the globe. In Zambia, little is known about the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare students. This study assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on health professions students at the University of Zambia. Methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2021 to October 2021. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with anxiety and depression among the participants. Data were analysed using Stata 16.1. Results: of the 452 students, 57.5% were female, with the majority aged between 19 and 24 years. Overall, 65% (95% CI: 60.5-69.4) experienced anxiety, while 86% (95% CI: 82.7-89.3) experienced depression. Participants whose income was affected were more likely to experience anxiety (aOR;2.09, 95% CI: 1.29-3.37) and depression (aOR;2.87, 95% CI: 1.53-5.38). Anxiety was associated with difficulty in observing the COVID-19 preventive measures (aOR;1.84, 95% CI: 1.21-2.81). Being depressed was associated with having a chronic condition (aOR;3.98, 95% CI: 1.67-9.50) or a relative or friend who died from COVID-19 (aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.06-3.70). Conclusion: many students experienced anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 third wave of infections. This calls for mitigation measures because continued anxiety and depression can affect the academic performance of students. Fortunately, most of the associated factors are modifiable and can easily be targeted when formulating interventions to reduce anxiety and depression among students.","Mudenda, S.; Chomba, M.; Mukosha, M.; Daka, V.; Chileshe, M.; Okoro, R.

Results: The results revealed that the average score for depression in the participants was 9.19Â±9.23 out of 63 points. The factors affecting depression in the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic were satisfaction with major (moderate) (ÃŸ=-.38, p=.009), satisfaction with major (satisfied) (ÃŸ=-.35, p=.018), job-seeking anxiety (ÃŸ=.33, p&lt;.001), health status (good) (ÃŸ=-.28, p=.016), and self-efficacy (ÃŸ=-.26, p=.001), and the explanatory power of these variables for depression in the participants was 43.0%. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that for early prevention and management of depression in nursing students, to increase their satisfaction with the nursing major, it is necessary to implement learning enhancement programs and adopt strategies to improve their understanding of nursing. It is also necessary to develop and implement various extracurricular programs for reducing job-seeking anxiety and enhancing self-efficacy.","<U+C724>, <U+D615><U+C219>, <U+B958> <U+C740>, <U+C815>","https://doi.org/10.7475/kjan.2022.34.4.380","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Korean Journal of Adult Nursing; 34(4):380-390, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38020,""
"THE ROLE OF EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY SOCIAL WORK IN A VIRTUAL CLINIC DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The Psychiatry Emergency Services (PES) virtual clinic is an innovative clinical program that was established to enhance access to psychiatric crisis follow-up care during COVID-19. The clinic provides psychiatric follow-up via scheduled phone calls or videoconference for patients that have been seen by the PES team. The social worker has an important role on the PES virtual clinic team: they initiate initial assessments, collaboratively develop follow-up plans, and facilitate community care. The clinic meets the provincial agenda to reduce Emergency Department (ED) visits, ED/PES wait times, ED/PES overcrowding, and inappropriate admissions, while addressing both psychiatric needs and social determinants of health in an acute care setting. Throughout our survey of relevant literature, we found little research to inform the implementation of virtual care in Canadian healthcare emergency services (Hensel et al., 2020;Serhal et al., 2017). More specifically, there is a void in research regarding a collaborative psychiatric and social work care model in the context of a global pandemic. Further robust studies are needed and encouraged that use emergency psychiatric settings as critical prevention sites of mental healthÂ crises.Alternate :La clinique virtuelle des Psychiatry Emergency Services (PES) est un programme clinique innovant qui a Ã©tÃ© mis en place pour amÃ©liorer lâ€™accÃ¨s aux suivis lors des crises psychiatriques pendant la pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19.

"Diagnosis of Socio-Educational Needs in the Face of the Covid-19 Pandemic: Family Situation in the State of Aguascalientes (Mexico)","The general purpose of this study is to identify and diagnose the family situation, the main socio-educational needs and government services of support and advice required by the families of the State of Aguascalientes (Mexico), in order to guide the process of analysis and redesign of public policies in family matters, by the Strategic Consultative Body (OCE) of the State Government. For this, a study with a non-experimental design, of a transactional type and with an exploratory and descriptive scope, was carried out, in which a sample of 2,488 families answered an instrument designed to measure sociodemographic indicators, social cohesion and socio-educational needs in a context where the confinement promoted by the state and federal governments respectively due to the contingency of COVID-19 was just beginning. The analysis of the results showed an adequate level of reliability in the items analyzed for the purposes of this study. Likewise, it was revealed that in the State the priority socio-educational needs are those related to substance addictions, depression and sadness, psychological or verbal aggression, physical aggression and other addictions (social networks, video games, gambling, pornography, among others). Regarding the government services with the highest demand, family psychological care, learning assertive communication processes with children, as well as care and prevention of domestic violence were identified. The previous results are relevant for the fact of reflecting a diagnosis of the family situation in a context affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for the contribution they imply for the process of analysis and redefinition of state public policies on family matters as a result of the work of the OCE and the State Government.","Fernandez-De-Castro, J.; Ramirez-Ramirez, L.

"Impact of covid-19 on education, psychological wellness and life style of dental students in Saudi Arabia","The COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant impact on dental education, psychological health, and students' way of life worldwide. The new methods of teaching and learning had to be adapted by dental educational institutions. Due to lifestyle changes, COVID-19 had a major negative influence on students' mental health. Therefore, it is of interest to assess depression;anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) levels experienced by dental students and compare them with gender and course of students. A cross-sectional survey based descriptive study was conducted among 356 undergraduate dental students, aged between 18-31 years, at Riyadh Elm University, Riyadh, kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January â€“ March, 2022. A self-administered structured questionnaire written in English and Arabic language was given to all the willing participants. Four components of the questionnaire covered demographic information, the effect of COVID-19 on dental education, psychological health, and student lifestyle. In order to establish statistically significant variations across genders and student course levels regarding the effect of COVID-19 on dentistry education, the Chi-square test was used. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare depression, anxiety, stress scales (DASS- 21) with variables such as gender and course level of students. Statistical significance was set at p-value &lt;0.05.A total of 356 dental students were involved in this study with the total response rate of 92.2%.Majority of the respondents were males (56.2%) than females 156 (43.8), aged between 18-22 years (53.4%). Overall, moderate levels of the depression, anxiety and stress scores (DASS-21) were seen among 46.9%, 30.3% and 35.6% of the dental students, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on dentistry students' education, mental health, and way of life. More women and dentistry students on the clinical level felt the effects on their education. In order to implement psychological empowerment initiatives integrating institutional counseling services for students, the right steps should be done.","Abdul, Nishath Sayed, Alarbash, Sarah Abdulmohsin, Albati, Zinab Hassan, Alkhelaiwi, Nouf Khalid, Alkhalifa, Walaa Qasim, Shenoy, Mahesh","https://doi.org/10.6026/97320630018588","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Bioinformation; 18(6):588, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38023,""
"Enteritis in calves: anamnestic, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic evaluations with special attention to enteropathogenic rotavirus and bovine coronavirus","Introduction: Neonatal calf diarrhoea is a multifactorial disease that sometimes leads to high economic losses. It can be fatal due to dehydration and acidosis and has been one of the main causes of calf mortality. Material and methods: This retrospective study considered calves of a maximum of 35 days of age and with a diagnosed infection with rotavirus and/or bovine coronavirus. We examined the clinical records of 156 calves that were referred to the University Clinic for Ruminants in Vienna. Results Calves that had been treated with antibiotics before admission to the Clinic had a higher risk of staying longer, suggesting either that these calves had a more serious illness or that antibiotic treatment was not indicated and so therapeutic success was not achieved. Twenty-three calves died or were euthanized at the Clinic. At the time of admission, they were younger than the surviving calves and they had a lower inner body temperature and a lower base excess at the first examination. The four most common pathogens in faecal samples were rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum and Escherichia coli, which were detected in 67.1%, 53.9%, 48.1% and 94.1% of the faecal samples examined. The most common co-infection was rotavirus with Cryptosporidium parvum (17 faecal samples). We inspected the four most common pathogens in more detail. There were significant correlations between bovine coronavirus and season, with the risk of suffering from bovine coronavirus 1.6 times higher in winter than in other seasons. There was also a correlation between Cryptosporidium parvum and general behaviour: the risk of being infected with Cryptosporidium parvum was 2.6 times higher in calves that were moderately to severely depressed at the first examination. There was a correlation between co-infections and mortality, with calves with a co-infection at three times higher risk of dying than calves with a mono-infection.","Schoiswohl, J.; Sohm, C.; Eibl, C.; Krametter-Frotscher, R.","https://doi.org/10.5680/wtm000009","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Wiener Tierarztliche Monatsschrift; 109(Artikel 9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38024,""
"Brief Report: An Art Therapy Pilot Dyadic (parent/caregiver and child) Telehealth for Children Living with Autism Spectrum Disorder","Due to COVID-19 safety protocols, the vulnerable within our community had limited access to resources. Children of determination have encountered disruption to therapeutic services especially from March 2020 to November 2020. The pilot attempted to address question(s) of feasibility in maintaining services, preventing mental health and deterioration of symptoms and behaviour, and in increasing access to resources for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The research looked to question, if online services could substitute in-person services with this population, and to determine plausibility of online group art therapy services for children and their caregivers. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is still unclear;early published reports indicate the onset of moderate to severe depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress, potentially having a prolonged psychological impact on some individuals (Qiu et al., 2020). Overall, there is a lack of literature on art therapy in the region, and more so for online intervention, specifically in support of ASD during the pandemic. ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs a person's ability to communicate, socialize, and respond to certain stimuli within environments. Parents, pediatricians, and nurseries typically identify concerns that prompt diagnosis, ideally by age 3;prevalence is higher in males than females (Elsabbagh et al., 2012). ASD is recognized by delayed language development, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, impacting imagination, and difficulty with social interaction (Rapin & Dunn, 1997). Overall, the Middle East has had relatively little published research on ASD etiology, although statistics indicate that ASD affects 1 in 146 births in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Virolainen, 2020). Genetic linkage such as kinship and multiparity is culturally and regionally common. Epidemiological research into autism in the UAE is relatively new. The prevalence of autism likely remains underdetermined as many cases of autism potentially go undiagnosed within the community due to stigma and lack of awareness;mild cases can be unnoticed, and delayed diagnoses might result from a lack of focus or training in the area of early intervention (Salhia et al., 2014). It is, therefore, crucial that there is a continuation of support without disruption. Art Therapy is an integrative mental health profession that engages participants with the creative process, active art-making, and integrated psychological theory within the context of a therapeutic relationship (American Art Therapy Association, 2020). Art psychotherapists have a minimum of a master's degree in art psychotherapy with clinical practice and supervised experience before gaining professional registration, a rigorous process. Children with autism are generally referred to art therapy specifically in the West (Martin, 2009;Teeuw, 2011) to support coping with communication challenges, behaviour, and low self-esteem (Schweizer et al., 2014;Schweizer et al., 2017). Research demonstrates that children with autism are expected to benefit from a non-verbal treatment such as art therapy, through sensory exploration, looking at, and shaping art materials to facilitate expression (Malchiodi, 2003;Rubin, 2001;Schweizer et al., 2009). This pilot study explores if conducting art therapy online would be beneficial and fill the gap when in-person services are not possible.

"Art Therapy Service Provision during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)","Objective: To report novel developments in standard art therapy practices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic circa 2020-22. Background: Art therapy services are a new phenomenon in the Middle East, with current practitioners having received their training primarily in the UK, US, and Australia. Religious therapies, such as prayers, rituals, talismans (against the evil eye) and Quranic recitation continue to be common approaches to mental illness in the Arabian Gulf. The visual arts have experienced a renaissance in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, with billions of U.S. dollars of government funds invested in art education, galleries, exhibitions, and museums (Louvre Abu Dhabi, Museum of Islamic Art, etc.). Qatar has a national strategy to become an art and cultural hub in the Middle East. Methodology: Self-reflective exercises, process art, and specialist discussions among 5 experts in the field currently practicing in the Gulf were conducted in 2020 to document and analyze new methodologies and perspectives implemented during COVID-19 lockdowns, primarily in the area of telehealth and telemedicine. A related study by the authors in 2020, ""Best Practices in Art Therapy Telehealth Communication: Perspectives from the Middle East,"" provided additional analytical data. Qualitative data was organized into themes using standard Grounded Theory techniques. The practitioners framed their therapeutic work within the model of Relational Cultural Theory (RCT). Results and Discussion: The thematic findings were grouped under the headings: ""Stigma,"" ""Empowerment,"" ""Confidentiality,"" ""Therapeutic Relations,"" and ""Art/Nonverbal Communication."" The pandemic allowed practitioners to expand services geographically outside of the Gulf beyond traditional face-face meetings through the Zoom.com videoconferencing platform. Online sessions provided unexpected benefits in the areas of increased privacy and reduction of social stigma. Since telehealth laws in the Gulf are almost non-existent, practitioners collaborated with international partners to develop best practices and ethical guidelines adapted to the local cultural context. Results of the analysis revealed shifts in previously established boundaries and power dynamics (clients and therapists can turn video and microphone off, see each other's house, pets and other family members). The presence of family members at home sometimes impacted the privacy of the client, but in some situations allowed opportunities to meet extended family members, providing additional diagnostic clues into family dynamics. A reduced ability to communicate and understand nonverbal cues and body language (eye contact was different, lack of seeing the body) was cited as a drawback to virtual clinical encounters. The expert / novice skill level disparity of the therapist / client was diminished when co-creating digital artwork (ex. use of the Zoom whiteboard). The limitations on art materials that could be obtained during shop closures for some clients increased creativity and innovation in artmaking, but for others it decreased artmaking opportunities. Conclusion: All aspects of art therapy in the Arabian Gulf, and especially online services provision, are under-researched. Areas for further inquiry include: cultural adaptation of western models of care, local perceptions of the origins and treatment of mental health disorders, and awareness and acceptance of expressive arts psychotherapeutic interventions.

"Art Therapy and Beyond: Emerging Practice Innovations and Implications for Practice and Research in the Arabian Gulf","Engaging in the arts has been demonstrated scientifically to enhance brain function. Creativity can modify a person's perspective and experience of the world. Changes in cerebrum waves impact changes in the nervous system which can raise serotonin levels. This can affect emotions positively by regulating moods and improving brain function which influences both psychological and physiological wellbeing. Creativity is part of our natural development and should be a part of our healing as a community. Art Therapy (AT) is a mental health profession which carries out innovative adaptations as it is recognized as a stand-alone clinical intervention and through community engagement and social justice. Art Therapists are collaborating within diverse fields of clinical and non-clinical practice such as neuroscience and virtual reality. Three papers explore the development of Art Therapy as a profession in Qatar and how AT is an accessible and underutilised or often misjudged profession. Paper one introduces ways that AT is practiced as a clinical, social action and community-based profession. AT might address the shame connected with psychological wellness by connecting with communities, sharing experiences of AT with the general public and by clinical professionals to support their careers, prompting less burnout. Dr. Hadi Mohamad Abu Rasheed shares the Qatar Cancer Society's experience of using Art in psychosocial support for children living with cancer. The western trained Art Therapist's awareness of cultural competence when working in the context of non-western cultural approaches to mental health is imperative to complement the heritage, creativity and community values of the local culture. Intersectional frameworks will inform ethical professional values to be upheld. Paper two develops how AT offers context to reduce the stigma of mental health in Qatar. The first Museum and Gallery AT visit in Qatar, with patients attending a substance misuse program, saw outcomes that included increased engagement in clinical sessions and an art exhibition that was held in the hospital and at conferences within Qatar and globally. Paper three discusses the global alterations in the AT workplace following the Covid-19 epidemic;online AT;and how AT has adapted to employing technology before and after the pandemic. The technology employed in AT is not new. Art Therapists are now using Virtual Reality, where the client becomes part of the world they have created, interacting in it, with the art therapist present. The Emotion Sensing Recognition (ESRA) app is being developed by Dr. Mowafa and Dr. Jens with the consultation of an Art Therapist Trish, to ensure the ethics of working with images. This app can increase positive parent-child attachment and increase the ability to recognise and talk about feelings for parent and child. AT is a cost-effective adaptive treatment and is being prescribed by General Practitioners in the UK and USA alongside visits to museums, choirs etc. How will Qatar embrace this adaptable, unique profession and will ensure it is ethically practiced by trained licensed Art Therapists? Collaborative research and training within different fields should be encouraged.

"â€œThe show must go onâ€: Aftermath of Covid-19 on anesthesiology residency programs","COVID-19 has caused tectonic changes in the personal and professional lives of anesthesiologists and, among several aspects, anesthesiology residency and sub-specialty training has also undergone an unforeseen overhaul. We read the articles published on the impact of COVID-19 on training of anesthesiologists and set out to extract and narrate all the significant observations. At the outset, we begin by explaining how this pandemic posed a threat to the safety of the residents and mitigating measures like PPE and barriers that have now become 'the new normal'. Sub-specialties like critical care, cardiac anesthesia, pain and palliative care have also faced difficulty in imparting training due to an initial dearth in elective surgery case load but have adapted innovative measures to overcome that. Initially, conducting thesis and research became difficult due to problems in achieving the desires sample size needed to get significant results, but this pandemic has emerged as a dynamic laboratory where topics like 'psychological impact of COVID-19' and 'development of artificial intelligence models in COVID -19 ICUs' came into the fore. Pattern of examination has also become virtual and webinars showed how knowledge, with the right medium, has the potential of global outreach. As the pandemic took a toll on the mental health of the residents, attention was paid to this previously neglected aspect and ensuring their emotional well-being became a priority to avoid the issue of burn-out. We comment on how what initially was considered a scary problem, actually paved way for growth. It brought attention to safety, innovation, new tools for training, finding solutions within constraints, continuing developing our residents into future leaders who were also trained for mitigating disasters. Changes like online education, research on socio-economic impact, priority to mental health and artificial intelligence are here to stay and by imbibing it, we ensure that 'the show must go on'.","Jaju, Rishabh, Saxena, Medhavi, Paliwal, Naveen, Bihani, Pooja, Tharu, Vidya","https://doi.org/10.4103/sja.sja_563_22","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia; 16(4):452-456, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38029,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on orthodontic patientâ€™s inflow in daily orthodontic practice: A cross-sectional study","Aim: To evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on orthodontic patientsâ€™ apprehension and inflow and to investigate the treatment-related problems encountered during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Saudi Arabia, and patients with active orthodontic treatment were reached via an online questionnaire. A total of 260 orthodontic patients agreed to participate in the study. The sample size calculation was performed using the Raosoft sample size calculator based on the estimation of 75% of the population need orthodontic treatment. The questionnaire included three sections: demographic data, patient fear, and troubles encountered during the lockdown. A link was sent to the participants via different social media platforms and applications. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to assess differences between the variables. Pearson correlation, binomial logistic regression, and multiple logistic regression tests were used to assess the extent of the relationship between patient apprehension and safety measures of COVID-19, as well as between patient orthodontic-related problems. Results: About half of the participants (52.3%) were not afraid of COVID-19 or panicked;however, 54% of them felt depressed during the lockdown. More than 80% were not afraid of visiting the orthodontists or thinking of changing their orthodontists for safety measures and did not want to postpone their treatment. The participants felt that excellent disinfection was the most important measure of infection control followed by wearing masks, face shields, and protective clothing. Conclusion: COVID-19 and the lockdown have a noticeable impact on the patientsâ€™ apprehension and dejection. A very high percentage of patients in this study showed no hesitation to visit their orthodontists, and they did not want to stop their treatment during the pandemic. The most common treatment-related problem reported was cheek injury, followed by bracket breakage.","Al-Gunaid, Talat, Hammad, Mohammad, Maher, Shahada, Allam, Hamzah, Abdulqader, Abuanq, Zakour, Ghaidaa, Zubaidi, Hazim, Karbouji, Ghofran","https://doi.org/10.4103/JIOH.JIOH_58_22","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of International Oral Health; 14(4):409-415, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38030,""

"The Silent Toll of Second COVID-19 Wave: A Dass-21 Questionnaire Survey among Health-Care Workers at a Tertiary-Care Public Hospital, Mumbai","Background: The uncontrolled spread of the COVID-19 disease in India's second wave post-February 2021, put to task the public health system across the nation. This, in turn, exhausted our health-care workforce both physically and mentally. To establish the prevalence of psychological symptoms and guide the action plan in place, the present study was undertaken among COVID-19 health-care workers (HCWs) at tertiary-care public hospital, Mumbai. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted after due institutional ethical clearance among 212 HCWs engaged in the management of COVID-19 patients during the second wave. A Google Form (R) was created in English, Hindi, and Marathi languages for self-administration. Data were collected under three domains;informed consent, sociodemographic and workplace-related details, and DASS-21 Questionnaire scores. This was further subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS (R) software. Results: This study included 90 (42.5%) doctors, 91 (42.9%) nurses, and 31 (14.6%) other categories of HCWs. Depression was prevalent in 44.3% HCWs, while 43.9% and 36.3% of the HCWs were affected by anxiety and stress, respectively. Younger population, female gender, and doctors were associated (P &lt; 0.05) with an increased likelihood of either of the prevalent psychological symptoms. Other significantly associated (P &lt; 0.05) factors included COVID-19 vaccination status of the HCW, history of COVID-19 infection, infected colleague at workplace, workplace housing facilities and commute, number of dependents on the HCW and hospitalized family member or close friend. Conclusion: The COVID-19 HCWs were found to be under considerable psychological strain. In essence, screening, identifying, and effectively targeting HCWs for psychological interventions is needed to protect and strengthen the health-care system.","Khan, F.; Dewalwar, V.; Roy, P.; Merchant, H.; Das, S.; Desousa, A.","https://doi.org/10.4103/aip.aip_61_22","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Indian Psychiatry; 6(2):155-163, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38032,""
"Incidence of Psychiatric Illness among COVID-19-Positive Individuals with and Without Loss of Smell or Taste Symptoms in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India - A Prospective Cohort Study","Background: COVID infection is known to cause acute and long-term neuropsychiatric presentations. Coronavirus infections are known to have neuroinvasive potential with consequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, and COVID-19-positive individuals were grouped based on the presence or absence of loss of smell (anosmia) or taste symptoms (ageusia). Group 1 without smell or taste disturbance, and Group 2 with smell or taste disturbance. Both groups were followed up for 6 months to assess the new onset of psychiatric illness. Results: The onset of new psychiatric illness was present in 8 out of 30 (26.66%) cases in group 2 when compared with 2 out of 30 (6.66%) cases in Group 1, with a relative risk of 4 (95% confidence interval 0.9247-17.3023). In 10 cases, the pattern of psychiatric illness was depression (16.66%), anxiety (6.6%), posttraumatic stress disorder (3.33%), acute psychosis (3.33%), and acute stress disorder (3.33%). Both groups were compared in terms of socio-demographic profile, inflammatory markers, and computed tomography severity score, and no significant difference was noted between the two. A relative risk of 4 indicates that COVID-19-infected individuals who lose their sense of smell or taste are more likely to develop new-onset psychiatric illness. Conclusion: Impact of COVID-19 on the central nervous system is very evident, and loss of smell or taste symptoms could be an early marker. Early recognition and prompt treatment with immunotherapy or newer therapies will prevent the emergence of psychiatric disturbance and its disability.","Shankar, S.; Rahamathulla, M. M.

"Background of suicide amidst COVID-19 pandemic in India: A review of published literature","Background and Objectives: Globally, suicide is a pertinent public health crisis that affects almost all nations cross-culturally. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in many countries, even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit worldwide. India, a nation developing rapidly, is also not free from the leashes of suicide deaths. COVID-19 augmented the rate of suicide due to multifaceted determinants. Adequate empirical evidence about data on suicide is also scarce. Materials and Methods: This review synthesizes determinants, available demographic correlates, and reported rates of suicide published in the Indian context. The authors conducted a thorough literature search to find published English free full-text scientific articles related to suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian context. Databases relied on for literature were PubMed, Google scholar, and PLOS one databases using comprehensive search strategies to avail the maximum number of studies. Results: Ten out of 76 studies available in the initial search were analyzed thoroughly for ruling out determinants, rates, and sociodemographic correlates of suicide. Fear of COVID-19 infection, financial crisis, mental breakdown, and job loss are cardinal reasons attributed for suicide, and male suicides are more prevalent in this arena. Interpretation and Conclusions: Findings portray factors such as fear of COVID-19 diagnosis, apprehension to become infected, financial crisis, loss of job, and isolation are some of the significant determinants quoted out. The study points out the need for multifaceted policies in preventing this public health crisis.","Kumar, L. M.; George, R.

"Vaccination Status and Attitudes towards Vaccines in a Cohort of Patients with Celiac Disease","(1) Background: The identification of vaccination status and attitudes towards vaccines among celiac disease (CD) patients is of great importance, but it has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), attitudes towards vaccinations, and its determinants among CD patients. (2) Methods: An anonymous web-based validated questionnaire was sent to a mailing list of CD adult patients. Patients were asked to self-report their previous vaccinations and attitudes towards vaccinations, which were defined as positive, negative, and partially positive/negative. The influencing factors towards vaccinations were investigated, and crude and adjusted odds ratios (AdjORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. (3) Results: The questionnaire was sent to 412 patients, with a response rate of 31.6% (130 patients, 105 women, median age 40 years, interquartile range 36â€“51). Patients self-reported vaccination against the following diseases: 73.8% tetanus, 42.3% flu, 20% measles, mumps and rubella, 19.2% meningitis, and 16.2% pneumococcus. Thirty-two people (24.6%) did not remember all of their previous vaccinations. In total, 104 (80%) respondents had a positive attitude towards vaccines, 25 (19.2%) a partially positive/negative one, and 1 a negative one. The determinants significantly influencing the positive attitude were being a graduate (AdjORs 7.49) and a belief in the possible return of VPDs with declining vaccination coverage rates (AdjORs 7.42), while the use of complementary and alternative medicines (AdjORs 0.11) and past negative experience (AdjORs 0.16) were associated with a negative attitude. (4) Conclusions: Despite four out of five CD patients showing a strong positive attitude towards vaccinations, one out of five had a partially negative one. Only a minority (16â€“20%) reported being vaccinated against some VPDs potentially harmful to their CD because of hyposplenism, such as meningitis and pneumococcus. The low vaccination rate against some VPDs, in spite of the 80% of CD patients stating a positive attitude towards vaccination, may be explained in part by patientsâ€™ vaccine hesitancy and in part by a possible role of physicians in under-prescribing vaccinations to these patients. These results may be a starting point for developing specific vaccination campaigns to increase vaccination rates against VPDs in CD patients.","Costantino, Andrea, Michelon, Marco, Roncoroni, Leda, Doneda, Luisa, Lombardo, Vincenza, Costantino, Claudio, Vecchi, Maurizio, Elli, Luca","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081199","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(8):1199, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38037,""
"Frontal Alpha Asymmetry and Negative Mood: A Cross-Sectional Study in Older and Younger Adults","Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been associated with emotional processing and affective psychopathology. Negative and withdrawal stimuli and behaviors have been related to high levels of right cortical activity, while positive and approach stimuli and behaviors have been related to increased left cortical activity. Inconsistent results in terms of depressive and anxious symptoms and their relationship to FAA have been previously observed, especially at older ages. Additionally, no studies to date have evaluated whether loneliness, a negative feeling, is related to FAA. Therefore, this study aimed (i) to compare FAA between younger and older adults and (ii) to investigate the possible relationships between loneliness, depressive and anxious symptomatology with FAA in young and older adults. Resting electroencephalogram recordings of 39 older (Mage = 70.51, SD = 7.12) and 57 younger adults (Mage = 22.54, SD = 3.72) were analyzed. Results showed greater left than right cortical activity for both groups and higher FAA for older than younger adults. FAA was not predicted by loneliness, depressive or anxious symptomatology as shown by regression analyses. Findings bring clarity about FAA patterns at different ages and open the discussion about the relationship between negative emotional processing and frontal cortical imbalances, especially at older ages.","Barros, Catarina, Pereira, Ana Rita, Sampaio, Adriana, BujÃ¡n, Ana, Pinal, Diego","https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14081579","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Symmetry; 14(8):1579, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38038,""
"Life-Cycle Spatial Strategy for Multidimensional Health-Oriented Medical Care Communityâ€”From the Perspective of Sustainable Marketing","The aging population and the increasing number of sub-healthy people in all age groups in China have brought huge opportunities for related industries. From the perspective of marketing and consumer psychology, there is a great demand for health care properties, especially those that provide long-term medical care. Against this situation, almost all the leading real estate companies have entered this field and tried to occupy more market shares through different products and brand marketing sustainably. In this context, it is urgent to explore a comprehensive community model combining medical and nursing care that covers all stages of life, so as to promote the health of diverse populations. In China, existing research on the growth of medical care communities for sustainable needs started relatively late, and insufficient attention has been paid to the supplyâ€“demand linkage among psychological demand, health behavior, spatial bearing, and service supply. Taking Wuzhishan city for example, we deduce the Medical-Care Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs System according to classical theories. Based on motivation theory and marketing strategy, a theoretical model of Health demand-behavior-facilities and Spatial Interaction (HBSI) mediated by healthy behavior is constructed. Then, expert group decision making processes and the Fuzzy Delphi Method (DFM) were used to screen 67 spatial impact factors of 14 categories in five dimensions, including life safety, physical health, mental health, social adaptation and resilience recovery, which fit usersâ€™ multi-dimensional health needs. Finally, to provide a spatial strategy reference for the construction of sustainable and adaptive medical caring communities, spatial planning strategies and guidelines are offered based on correlation analysis, so as to fit the changeable market pattern, meet the psychological expectations and life-cycle caring needs of consumers.","Le, Che, Guo, Zhijian, Yang, Yi, Kang, Honghao, Cao, Shangqing","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141711081","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(17):11081, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38039,""
"Online Retailerâ€™s Contingent Free-Shipping Decisions under Large-Scale Promotions Considering Delayed Delivery","Large-scale promotions lead to a huge number of orders, and the quantity of deliveries grows sharply, which puts considerable strain on citiesâ€™ logistics and imposes high related shipping costs. To alleviate these consequences, in this paper we provide a new contingent free shipping policy with delayed delivery (DD-CFS) for an online retailer during large-scale promotions and study its CFS threshold decisions, considering consumersâ€™ different sensitivities to delivery time delays.We start by analyzing a consumerâ€™s purchasing decision based on consumer utility theory. Next, we establish a mathematical model to help the online retailer find the optimal CFS threshold to maximize its expected profit. Finally, we analyze the benefit of delayed delivery to the online retailer and conduct a sensitivity analysis to examine the impacts of important parameters on the online retailerâ€™s CFS threshold decisions, profit, and the value of the delayed delivery. We find that the DD-CFS policy can lead to more profits during the large-scale promotions period compared with the traditional CFS policy. As the delayed delivery time and the consumerâ€™s negative attitude towards delayed delivery time increase, the online retailer should reduce the low CFS threshold value. On the other hand, as the shipping fee and the consumerâ€™s negative attitude towards the shipping fee increase, the online retailer should raise the high and low CFS threshold values.","Ma, Xiaxia, Bian, Wenliang, Yang, Xiqing, Niu, Shengnan, Cai, Yongming, Guan, Jie, Wang, Wenbin","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141710773","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(17):10773, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38040,""
"Potential Implications of Optimism and Mental Health for the Independent Learning of Chinese University Students","This study investigated the potential implications of optimism and mental health in promoting independent learning among Chinese university students using a theoretical model related to loneliness, optimism, mental health, independent learning, and academic achievement and the relationships between them. Valid data were obtained from 509 participants from four universities in Wuhan, China, through a questionnaire with five-point Likert scales specific to loneliness, optimism, mental health, independent learning, and academic achievement in September 2021. These data were used to construct models to test measurement validity and mediating mechanisms through structural equation modeling. The results revealed that loneliness influences mental health, thereby influencing the academic achievement of Chinese university students, and optimism can reduce the partial negative effect of loneliness on studentsâ€™ mental health. Good mental health can support independent learning to promote academic achievement. This study provides recommendations for university managers to promote independent learning among Chinese university students.","Yang, Dong, Swekwi, Usaporn, Dai, Xiao, Tu, Chia Ching","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141710602","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(17):10602, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38041,""
"Using a Sensitivity Analysis and Spatial Clustering to Determine Vulnerability to Potentially Toxic Elements in a Semiarid City in Northwest Mexico","The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic clustering technique was used to create a hot spot exposure map using 14 potentially toxic elements (PTEs) found in urban dust samples in a semiarid city in northwest Mexico. The dust distribution and deposition in this city are influenced by the seasonal wind and rain from the North American Monsoon. The spatial clustering patterns of hot spots were used in combination with a sensitivity analysis to determine which variables most influenced the PTE hot spot exposure base map. The hot spots areas (%) were used as indicators of environmental vulnerability, and a final integrated map was selected to represent the highest vulnerability of PTEs with a 99% level of confidence. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the flood zones and pervious and impervious zones were the most sensitive variables due to their weight in the spatial distribution. The hot spot areas were reduced by 60.4% by not considering these variables. The hot spot analysis resulted in an effective tool that allowed the combination of different spatial layers with specific characteristics to determine areas that present greater vulnerability to the distribution of PTEs, with impacts on public and environmental health.","Vizuete-Jaramillo, Efrain, Meza-Figueroa, Diana, Reyes-Castro, Pablo A.; Robles-Morua, Agustin","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141710461","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(17):10461, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38042,""
"A Multidimensional Evaluation of Technology-Enabled Assessment Methods during Online Education in Developing Countries","Humanity has faced unprecedented chaos in the education sector due to the inevitable sudden adoption of online mode of learning during the pandemic. The complexities associated with technology-enabled learning and assessment have different connotations in developing countries due to a lack of infrastructure and awareness. Such countries can switch over to an online mode of education more frequently in the future due to highly volatile local political and cultural situations on top of the pandemic. This study evaluates the complexities associated with technology-enabled online assessment methods in Pakistan. Technology readiness and performance for the learning assessment of students are appraised through approaching approximately one thousand students from more than one hundred public and private sector engineering universities. A screened list of assessment alternatives and their influencing factors are then prioritized using the multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) by considering the perceptions of national policymakers, faculty members and students. The aggregate results reveal that, among the influencing factors, â€˜mental healthâ€™ received the highest weightage, and stakeholders are indifferent to associated costs despite financial challenges. Automated MCQs secured the top position in the ranking list. Sensitivity analysis incorporates some disagreements among the stakeholders, which makes this study highly beneficial for policy modeling.","Ambreen Sultana, Khattak, Ali, Muhammad Khurram, Mohammed Al, Awadh","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141610387","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(16):10387, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38043,""
"Do Investor Overconfidence and Loss Aversion Drive Saudi Firm Market Performance? The Moderating Effect of Corporate Governance","sThis study investigated the impact of investor psychological bias on a firmâ€™s market value. In detail, we examined the effect of investor overconfidence (optimism) and loss aversion (pessimism) on firm market value. We also aimed to investigate the moderating effect of corporate governance on the relationship between investor behavior biases and firm market value. This study used a sample of 143 firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange over the period from 2012 to 2021. The results suggest that investor overconfidence affects a firmâ€™s value positively. On the other hand, loss aversion is negatively associated with the firmâ€™s market value. Furthermore, we find that corporate governance (measured by board size and board independence) enhances the positive association between overconfidence and firm market value. In contrast, we find that corporate governance seems to marginally mitigate the negative effect of loss aversion.","Aljughaiman, Abdullah A.; Chebbi, Kaouther E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141610072","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(16):10072, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38044,""
"A Development of Counseling Competency for Academic Advisors in Higher Education","Southeast Asia has a high prevalence of mental health problems and a low desire to seek professional help. Low treatment rates in LMICs are also reflected in the lack of readily available treatments geared toward students. In developing countries such as Thailand, academic advisors in higher education play another extra role in providing appropriate mental health counseling beyond teaching, researching, and delivering academic advising to their students. This quasi-experimental research aimed to study counselingâ€™s competency of academic advisors in higher education and develop counselingâ€™s competency of academic advisors in higher education. The sample groups used in this study were academic advisors who worked in a Thai university. There were two data collection stages. In stage 1, 250 samples were selected using a multi-stage random sampling technique for examining counseling competency. In stage 2, 60 samples used in the first stage having counselingâ€™s competency score rating from low to moderate were equally divided into two groups (control and intervention). The results in the first stage showed that the total mean score of counseling competency was moderate. In the second stage, the hypothesis-tested result also showed significant differences in counseling competency outcomes in the intervention and control groups. These findings highlight intervention;the Brief Counseling Competency Training Program (BCCTP) could be helpful for reskilling and upskilling academic advisorsâ€™ counseling competency, especially attitude dimension, and implicate set friendly services, a sustainable academic advisor network to support and strengthen these competencies.","Choompunuch, Bovornpot, Lebkhao, Dussadee, Suksatan, Wanich, Suk-erb, Wipanee","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14169907","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(16):9907, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38045,""
"From Mental Health Crisis to Existential Human Suffering: The Role of Self-Transcendence in Contemporary Mindfulness","Our paper addresses the so-called college mental health crisis and the adoption of the strategy of mindfulness-based interventions. We offer a critique of their underlying medicalâ€“therapeutic paradigm by engaging the notion of self-transcendence in Viktor Franklâ€™s Existential Analysis and Buddhism in dialogue. We argue that the current mindfulness movement has decontextualized and appropriated mindfulness from its Buddhist foundations in favor of a model that offers objectively verifiable biophysical and mental benefits. Self-transcendence, whether from the perspective of Buddhism or Franklâ€™s work, offers what we feel is an existentially viable path forward for college students, in lieu of the current paradigm promoted by those advocating use of these mindfulness-based interventions. We conclude by considering Existential and Buddhist notions of self-transcendence in dialogue, suggesting they offer an educational practice worthy of implementation.","Renata Cueto de, Souza, Scott, Charles","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13080681","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(8):681, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38046,""
"The PROVIT Studyâ€”Effects of Multispecies Probiotic Add-on Treatment on Metabolomics in Major Depressive Disorderâ€”A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial","The gutâ€“brain axis plays a role in major depressive disorder (MDD). Gut-bacterial metabolites are suspected to reduce low-grade inflammation and influence brain function. Nevertheless, randomized, placebo-controlled probiotic intervention studies investigating metabolomic changes in patients with MDD are scarce. The PROVIT study (registered at clinicaltrials.com NCT03300440) aims to close this scientific gap. PROVIT was conducted as a randomized, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled multispecies probiotic intervention study in individuals with MDD (n = 57). In addition to clinical assessments, metabolomics analyses (1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) of stool and serum, and microbiome analyses (16S rRNA sequencing) were performed. After 4 weeks of probiotic add-on therapy, no significant changes in serum samples were observed, whereas the probiotic groupsâ€™ (n = 28) stool metabolome shifted towards significantly higher concentrations of butyrate, alanine, valine, isoleucine, sarcosine, methylamine, and lysine. Gallic acid was significantly decreased in the probiotic group. In contrast, and as expected, no significant changes resulted in the stool metabolome of the placebo group. Strong correlations between bacterial species and significantly altered stool metabolites were obtained. In summary, the treatment with multispecies probiotics affects the stool metabolomic profile in patients with MDD, which sets the foundation for further elucidation of the mechanistic impact of probiotics on depression.","Kreuzer, Kathrin, Reiter, Alexandra, Birkl-TÃ¶glhofer, Anna Maria, Dalkner, Nina, MÃ¶rkl, Sabrina, Mairinger, Marco, Fleischmann, Eva, Fellendorf, Frederike, Platzer, Martina, Lenger, Melanie, FÃ¤rber, Tanja, Seidl, Matthias, Birner, Armin, Queissner, Robert, Lilli-Marie, Stefanie Mendel, Maget, Alexander, Kohlhammer-Dohr, Alexandra, HÃ¤ussl, Alfred, Wagner-Skacel, Jolana, SchÃ¶ggl, Helmut, Amberger-Otti, Daniela, Painold, Annemarie, Lahousen-Luxenberger, Theresa, Leitner-Afschar, Brigitta, Haybaeck, Johannes, Habisch, HansjÃ¶rg, Madl, Tobias, Reininghaus, Eva, Bengesser, Susanne","https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo12080770","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Metabolites; 12(8):770, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38047,""
"Potential Psychoactive Effects of Microalgal Bioactive Compounds for the Case of Sleep and Mood Regulation: Opportunities and Challenges","Sleep deficiency is now considered an emerging global epidemic associated with many serious health problems, and a major cause of financial and social burdens. Sleep and mental health are closely connected, further exacerbating the negative impact of sleep deficiency on overall health and well-being. A major drawback of conventional treatments is the wide range of undesirable side-effects typically associated with benzodiazepines and antidepressants, which can be more debilitating than the initial disorder. It is therefore valuable to explore the efficiency of other remedies for complementarity and synergism with existing conventional treatments, leading to possible reduction in undesirable side-effects. This review explores the relevance of microalgae bioactives as a sustainable source of valuable phytochemicals that can contribute positively to mood and sleep disorders. Microalgae species producing these compounds are also catalogued, thus creating a useful reference of the state of the art for further exploration of this proposed approach. While we highlight possibilities awaiting investigation, we also identify the associated issues, including minimum dose for therapeutic effect, bioavailability, possible interactions with conventional treatments and the ability to cross the blood brain barrier. We conclude that physical and biological functionalization of microalgae bioactives can have potential in overcoming some of these challenges.","McCarthy, Bozena, Graham, Oâ€™Neill, Abu-Ghannam, Nissreen","https://doi.org/10.3390/md20080493","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Marine Drugs; 20(8):493, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38048,""
"Efficient Ontology Meta-Matching Based on Interpolation Model Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm","Ontology is the kernel technique of the Semantic Web (SW), which models the domain knowledge in a formal and machine-understandable way. To ensure different ontologiesâ€™ communications, the cutting-edge technology is to determine the heterogeneous entity mappings through the ontology matching process. During this procedure, it is of utmost importance to integrate different similarity measures to distinguish heterogeneous entity correspondence. The way to find the most appropriate aggregating weights to enhance the ontology alignmentâ€™s quality is called ontology meta-matching problem, and recently, Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) has become a great methodology of addressing it. Classic EA-based meta-matching technique evaluates each individual through traversing the reference alignment, which increases the computational complexity and the algorithmâ€™s running time. For overcoming this drawback, an Interpolation Model assisted EA (EA-IM) is proposed, which introduces the IM to predict the fitness value of each newly generated individual. In particular, we first divide the feasible region into several uniform sub-regions using lattice design method, and then precisely evaluate the Interpolating Individuals (INIDs). On this basis, an IM is constructed for each new individual to forecast its fitness value, with the help of its neighborhood. For testing EA-IMâ€™s performance, we use the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) Benchmark in the experiment and the final results show that EA-IM is capable of improving EAâ€™s searching efficiency without sacrificing the solutionâ€™s quality, and the alignmentâ€™s f-measure values of EA-IM are better than OAEIâ€™s participants.","Xue, Xingsi, Wu, Qi, Ye, Miao, Lv, Jianhui","https://doi.org/10.3390/math10173212","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mathematics; 10(17):3212, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38049,""
"Mental Health Symptom Reduction Using Digital Therapeutics Care Informed by Genomic SNPs and Gut Microbiome Signatures","Neuropsychiatric diseases and obesity are major components of morbidity and health care costs, with genetic, lifestyle, and gut microbiome factors linked to their etiology. Dietary and weight-loss interventions can help improve mental health, but there is conflicting evidence regarding their efficacy;and moreover, there is substantial interindividual heterogeneity that needs to be understood. We aimed to identify genetic and gut microbiome factors that explain interindividual differences in mental health improvement after a dietary and lifestyle intervention for weight loss. We recruited 369 individuals participating in Digbi Healthâ€™s personalized digital therapeutics care program and evaluated the association of 23 genetic scores, the abundance of 178 gut microbial genera, and 42 bacterial pathways with mental health. We studied the presence/absence of anxiety or depression, or sleep problems at baseline and improvement on anxiety, depression, and insomnia after losing at least 2% body weight. Participants lost on average 5.4% body weight and &gt;95% reported improving mental health symptom intensity. There were statistically significant correlations between: (a) genetic scores with anxiety or depression at baseline, gut microbial functions with sleep problems at baseline, and (b) genetic scores and gut microbial taxa and functions with anxiety, depression, and insomnia improvement. Our results are concordant with previous findings, including the association between anxiety or depression at baseline with genetic scores for alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder. As well, our results uncovered new associations in line with previous epidemiological literature. As evident from previous literature, we also observed associations of gut microbial signatures with mental health including short-chain fatty acids and bacterial neurotoxic metabolites specifically with depression. Our results also show that microbiome and genetic factors explain self-reported mental health status and improvement better than demographic variables independently.

"H-FABP Levels and Psycho-Emotional Improvement of CABG Patients during Cardiac Rehabilitation","(1) Background: The heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a specific myocardial biomarker and high levels indicate ischemia regardless of patient-reported symptoms. Concurrently, major adverse cardiovascular events and surgery such as coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG) cause substantial psycho-emotional distress e.g., depression and anxiety. Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation is, therefore, essential to both physical and psychological recovery. (2) Methods: This is a unicentric, prospective study on 120 consecutive post-CABG patients undergoing a 6-month cardiac rehabilitation program based on physical exercise, Mediterranean diet principles, and Q10 coenzyme antioxidant supplements. H-FABP levels, depression, and anxiety scores (Hamilton HAM-D and HAM-A scales) were monitored after surgery and at 6 months. (3) Results: Mean H-FABP dropped from 60.56 to 4.81. Physical ability increased from 1â€“2 to 4â€“5 METS. Mean depression and anxiety improved from 15.88 to 6.96 and from 25.13 to 15.68, respectively. Median scores went down 50% for depression and 9% for anxiety. Explored associations between H-FABP and psycho-emotional status were statistically insignificant.

"Effects of Two Distinct Psychoactive Microbes, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus JB-1 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri 6475, on Circulating and Hippocampal mRNA in Male Mice","Discovery of the microbiota-gutâ€“brain axis has led to proposed microbe-based therapeutic strategies in mental health, including the use of mood-altering bacterial species, termed psychobiotics. However, we still have limited understanding of the key signaling pathways engaged by specific organisms in modulating brain function, and evidence suggests that bacteria with broadly similar neuroactive and immunomodulatory actions can drive different behavioral outcomes. We sought to identify pathways distinguishing two psychoactive bacterial strains that seemingly engage similar gutâ€“brain signaling pathways but have distinct effects on behaviour. We used RNAseq to identify mRNAs differentially expressed in the blood and hippocampus of mice following Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus JB-1, and Limosilactobacillus reuteri 6475 treatment and performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify enrichment in pathway activity. L. rhamnosus, but not L. reuteri treatment altered several pathways in the blood and hippocampus, and the rhamnosus could be clearly distinguished based on mRNA profile. In particular, L. rhamnosus treatment modulated the activity of interferon signaling, JAK/STAT, and TNF-alpha via NF-KB pathways. Our results highlight that psychobiotics can induce complex changes in host gene expression, andin understanding these changes, we may help fine-tune selection of psychobiotics for treating mood disorders.","Haas-Neill, Sandor, Iwashita, Eiko, Dvorkin-Gheva, Anna, Forsythe, Paul","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23179653","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 23(17):9653, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38052,""
"Rationale, Feasibility, and Acceptability of the Meeting in Nature Together (MINT) Program: A Novel Nature-Based Social Intervention for Loneliness Reduction with Teen Parents and Their Peers","Recently, there has been an increase in feelings of loneliness and mental health conditions among adolescents. Within this population, parenting teens are at an increased risk for these conditions. Outdoor experiences are shown to be an antidote to loneliness and a way to promote social connectedness by amplifying the processes for supporting social relationships. In 2020â€“2021, we piloted the 8-week Meeting in Nature Together program (MINT) at a charter school for pregnant and parenting teenagers in Colorado, USA. MINT aimed to promote relatedness and nature connection for students ages 14 to 19. MINT included online and in-person group meetings with educational content, creative activities, discussion, park excursions, mindfulness activities, journaling, and nature photography. Here, we ask, can a school-level nature-based social intervention reduce loneliness among pregnant and parenting teens by promoting and sustaining social connections?

"Stress, Burnout, Anxiety and Depression among Teachers: A Scoping Review","Background: Worldwide, stress and burnout continue to be a problem among teachers, leading to anxiety and depression. Burnout may adversely affect teachersâ€™ health and is a risk factor for poor physical and mental well-being. Determining the prevalence and correlates of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression among teachers is essential for addressing this public health concern. Objective: To determine the extent of the current literature on the prevalence and correlates of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression among teachers. Method: This scoping review was performed using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Relevant search terms were used to determine the prevalence and correlates of teachersâ€™ stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression. Articles were identified using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Data Base), APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Scopus Elsevier and ERIC (Education Resources Information Center). The articles were extracted, reviewed, collated, and thematically analyzed, and the results were summarized and reported. Results: When only clinically meaningful (moderate to severe) psychological conditions among teachers were considered, the prevalence of burnout ranged from 25.12% to 74%, stress ranged from 8.3% to 87.1%, anxiety ranged from 38% to 41.2% and depression ranged from 4% to 77%. The correlates of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression identified in this review include socio-demographic factors such as sex, age, marital status, and school (organizational) and work-related factors including the years of teaching, class size, job satisfaction, and the subject taught. Conclusion: Teaching is challenging and yet one of the most rewarding professions, but several factors correlate with stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression among teachers. Highlighting these factors is the first step in recognizing the magnitude of the issues encountered by those in the teaching profession. Implementation of a school-based awareness and intervention program is crucial to resolve the early signs of teacher stress and burnout to avoid future deterioration.","Agyapong, Belinda, Obuobi-Donkor, Gloria, Burback, Lisa, Wei, Yifeng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710706","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10706, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38055,""
"Dual Mediating Effect of Electronic Device Utilization and Life Satisfaction on the Relationship between Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Depression in Older Adults","This study aimed to investigate the correlation between instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), depression, electronic device utilization (EDU) and life satisfaction in older adults and to evaluate the dual mediating effect of EDU and life satisfaction on the relationship between IADL and depression. A secondary data analysis of the 2020 Korean Elderly Survey was carried out with 9906 older adults. The dual mediating effect was analyzed using model 6 of PROCESS Macro for SPSS v. 4.1 (New York, NY, USA). EDU (B = -0.010, 95% CI [0.007, 0.013]) and life satisfaction (B = 0.071, 95% CI [0.064, 0.079]) each had a mediating effect on the relationship between IADL and depression in older adults, and in particular, these two variables were shown to dual mediate (B = 0.017, 95% CI [0.015, 0.019]). This study confirmed that life satisfaction can be increased and depression decreased by improving the ability to use electronic devices to combat the limitations in daily functioning due to aging. It is necessary to establish a strategy to increase EDU as a part of the intervention methods for managing depression in older adults.","Hwa-Soo, Koong, Lim, Mihye, Seo, Kawoun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710617","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10617, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38056,""
"Is There Always a Negative Causality between Human Health and Environmental Degradation? Current Evidence from Rural China","This study explores the incidence and trend of zoonoses in China and its relationship with environmental health and proposes suggestions for promoting the long-term sustainable development of human, animal, and environmental systems. The incidence of malaria was selected as the dependent variable, and the consumption of agricultural diesel oil and pesticides and investment in lavatory sanitation improvement in rural areas were selected as independent variables according to the characteristics of nonpoint source pollution and domestic pollution in Chinaâ€™s rural areas. By employing a fixed effects regression model, the results indicated that the use of pesticides was negatively associated with the incidence of malaria, continuous investment in rural toilet improvement, and an increase in economic income can play a positive role in the prevention and control of malaria incidence. Guided by the theory of One Health, this study verifies human, animal, and environmental health as a combination of mutual restriction and influence, discusses the complex causal relationship among the three, and provides evidence for sustainable development and integrated governance.","Zhou, Wei, Zhang, Fan, Cui, Shihao, Chang, Ke-Chiun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710561","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10561, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38057,""
"Mental Health of Japanese Workers: Amotivation Mediates Self-Compassion on Mental Health Problems","Workplace mental health is a cause for concern in many countries. Globally, 78% of the workforce experienced impairment of their mental health in 2020. In Japan, more than half of employees are mentally distressed. Previously, research has identified that self-compassion (i.e., being kind and understanding towards oneself) and work motivation were important to their mental health. However, how these three components relate to each other remains to be elucidated. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the relationship between mental health problems, self-compassion and work motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and amotivation). A cross-sectional design was employed, where 165 Japanese workers completed self-report scales regarding those three components. A correlation and path analyses were conducted. Mental health problems were positively associated with amotivation and negatively associated with age and self-compassion. While intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation did not mediate the impact of self-compassion on mental health problems, amotivation did. The findings can help managers and organizational psychologists help identify effective approaches to improving work mental health.","Kotera, Yasuhiro, Asano, Kenichi, Kotera, Hiromasa, Ohshima, Remi, Rushforth, Annabel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710497","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10497, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38058,""
"Leveraging Reddit for Suicidal Ideation Detection: A Review of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Techniques","Suicide is a major public-health problem that exists in virtually every part of the world. Hundreds of thousands of people commit suicide every year. The early detection of suicidal ideation is critical for suicide prevention. However, there are challenges associated with conventional suicide-risk screening methods. At the same time, individuals contemplating suicide are increasingly turning to social media and online forums, such as Reddit, to express their feelings and share their struggles with suicidal thoughts. This prompted research that applies machine learning and natural language processing techniques to detect suicidality among social media and forum users. The objective of this paper is to investigate methods employed to detect suicidal ideations on the Reddit forum. To achieve this objective, we conducted a literature review of the recent articles detailing machine learning and natural language processing techniques applied to Reddit data to detect the presence of suicidal ideations. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we selected 26 recent studies, published between 2018 and 2022. The findings of the review outline the prevalent methods of data collection, data annotation, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Furthermore, we present several Reddit-based datasets utilized to construct suicidal ideation detection models. Finally, we conclude by discussing the current limitations and future directions in the research of suicidal ideation detection.","Yeskuatov, Eldar, Sook-Ling, Chua, Lee Kien, Foo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610347","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):10347, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38059,""
"Results from Brazilâ€™s 2022 Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Adolescents","This research aims to summarize the process and results of the 2022 Report Card on Physical Activity for Brazilian children and adolescents.

"The Relationship between the Unmet Needs of Chinese Family Caregivers and the Quality of Life of Childhood Cancer Patients Undergoing Inpatient Treatment: A Mediation Model through Caregiver Depression","A large proportion of the global burden of childhood cancer arises in China. These patients have a poor quality of life (QoL) and their family caregivers have high unmet needs. This paper examined the association between the unmet needs of family caregivers and the care recipientâ€™s QoL. A total of 286 childhood cancer caregivers were included in this cross-sectional study. Unmet needs and depression among caregivers were assessed by the Comprehensive Needs Assessment Tool for Cancer Caregivers (CNAT-C) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. The patientâ€™s QoL was proxy-reported by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Measurement Models (PedsQL 3.0 scale Cancer Module). Descriptive analyses, independent Studentâ€™s t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and mediation analyses were performed. The mean scores (standard deviations) for unmet needs, depression, and QoL were 65.47 (26.24), 9.87 (7.26), and 60.13 (22.12), respectively. A caregiverâ€™s unmet needs (r = -0.272, p &lt; 0.001) and depression (r = -0.279, p &lt; 0.001) were negatively related to a care recipientâ€™s QoL. Depression among caregivers played a mediating role in the relationship between a caregiverâ€™s unmet needs and a care recipientâ€™s QoL. As nursing interventions address depression among caregivers, it is important to standardize the programs that offer psychological support to caregivers.","Wang, Jiamin, Coyte, Peter C.; Shao, Di, Zhen, Xuemei, Zhao, Ni, Chen, Sun, Sun, Xiaojie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610193","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):10193, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38061,""
"Sensory Processing Sensitivity and Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Japanese Adults","Background: Sensory processing sensitivity is a personality or temperamental trait defined as individual differences in the tendency to perceive and process both positive and negative stimuli and experiences. Studies have shown that high sensitivity is correlated with psychosocial health, including depression and anxiety. However, its relationship with physical health has not been clarified. To fill this gap, using a large sample size with sufficient statistical power, an adult sample not including university students, and a range of covariates, this study examined the association between gastrointestinal symptoms as an indicator of physical health and sensory processing sensitivity. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the participants were 863 Japanese adults (female = 450;male = 413;Mage = 30.4 years;SD = 4.9) who completed a web-based questionnaire. We statistically controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and examined whether sensory processing sensitivity is correlated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: The results showed that highly sensitive individuals were more likely to experience a wide range of gastrointestinal symptoms in the past week, including reflux symptoms, abdominal pain, indigestion symptoms, diarrhea symptoms, and constipation symptoms, even when statistically controlling for the participantsâ€™ sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that high sensory processing sensitivity is associated with physical health. Some of the potential causes of this are also discussed.","Iimura, Shuhei, Takasugi, Satoshi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169893","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9893, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38062,""
"State of Mental Health Research of Adolescents and Youth in Chile: An Ontological Analysis","Knowing the state of mental health research in adolescents and youth can be an important tool for decision-making, especially in contexts of limited resources. The aim of this study is to map the scientific research on adolescent and youth mental health in Chile using an ontological framework. We have mapped the population of research articles on mental health of adolescents and youth in Chile in Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO databases onto the ontology. The PRISMA reporting guidelines were used to screen the 1688 items based on relevance, duplication, and version. The corpus of 346 articles was coded into the ontology through an iterative process among the seven authors. This ontological mapping shows isolated research efforts that have been carried out in Chile to explain the whole state of mental health in adolescents and youth.

"Domains of Physical and Mental Workload in Health Work and Unpaid Domestic Work by Gender Division: A Study with Primary Health Care Workers in Brazil","Various studies indicate that workload metrics can be used to assess inequities in the division of labor according to gender and in the mental health of health care professionals. In most studies, the workload is portrayed in a way that does not integrate the different fields of work, that is, work in health services and unpaid domestic work. The objective was to determine the effects of the workload domains of health work and unpaid domestic work according to the gender division of health professionals working in primary health care (PHC), and to analyze the workload as an inducer of anxiety disorders and episodes of depression. This cross-sectional study consisted of 342 health care professionals recruited for interview at primary health care units in the extreme south of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Sociodemographic and occupational variables, workload in PHC and unpaid domestic work, and dichotomies of anxiety disorders and episodes of depression were considered. Poisson and multivariate linear regression models were used for data analysis. Cohenâ€™s standardized effect size was used to assess the magnitude of the difference between women and men in terms of workload. The female professionals presented higher scores in terms of PHC work and unpaid domestic work and higher proportions of episodes of depression and anxiety disorders compared to males. The male professionals showed that anxiety disorders presented a medium standardized effect size on domestic workload and the level of frustration with family involvement was higher in those with episodes of depression. The results illustrate that the workload metric is an important indicator of female vulnerability to working conditions in PHC and in the family environment.","Cezar-Vaz, Marta Regina, Daiani, Modernel Xavier, Clarice Alves, Bonow, Vaz, Jordana Cezar, LetÃ­cia Silveira, Cardoso, Cynthia Fontella, Santâ€™Anna, Valdecir Zavarese da, Costa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169816","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9816, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38064,""
"Analysis of Factors Related to Mental Health, Suppression of Emotions, and Personality Influencing Coping with Stress among Nurses","(1) The specificity of a nurseâ€™s work, apart from performing medical procedures, is characterized by intensive contacts with other people. Stress is an inevitable part of a nurseâ€™s job and can affect their physical and mental health. Thus, strategies for coping with stress play an important role in improving health or well-being by reducing the level of stress. (2) The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of coping strategies in predicting the overall health of nurses. The study also assessed the impact of personality traits and emotional control (anger, depression, anxiety) on the choice of coping with stress among nurses. (3) The study included 811 nurses from the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, with an average age of 40 (SD = 9.8), working mainly in hospitals (82%). The research was carried out with a diagnostic survey method, using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations questionnaire, NEO-Five Factor Inventor, Courtland Emotional Control Care Scale, General Health Questionnaire 30, and a demographic questionnaire. (4) Among the surveyed nurses, the dominant style of coping with stress was the style focused on emotions (MT 0.43), followed by the style focused on avoidance (MT 0.42). There were mental problems among 46.1% of the respondents. Nurses with mental problems according to GHQ-30 were characterized by a high intensity of coping styles focused on emotions (30.2%), avoiding (18.7%), and engaging in alternative activities (32.3%) (p = 0.000).

"Network Analysis for a Community-Based School- and Family-Based Obesity Prevention Program","Rising childhood obesity with its detrimental health consequences poses a challenge to the health care system. Community-based, multi-setting interventions with the participatory involvement of relevant stakeholders are emerging as promising. To gain insights into the structural and processual characteristics of stakeholder networks, conducting a network analysis (NA) is advisable. Within the program â€œFamily+â€”Healthy Living Together in Families and Schoolsâ€, a network analysis was conducted in two rural model regions and one urban model region. Relevant stakeholders were identified in 2020â€“2021 through expert interviews and interviewed by telephone to elicit key variables such as frequency of contact and intensity of collaboration. Throughout the NA, characteristics such as density, centrality, and connectedness were analyzed and are presented graphically. Due to the differences in the number of inhabitants and the rural or urban structure of the model regions, the three networks (network#1, network#2, and network#3) included 20, 14, and 12 stakeholders, respectively. All networks had similar densities (network#1, 48%;network#2, 52%;network#3, 42%), whereas the degree centrality of network#1 (0.57) and network#3 (0.58) was one-third higher compared with network#2 (0.39). All three networks differed in the distribution of stakeholders in terms of field of expertise and structural orientation. On average, stakeholders exchanged information quarterly and were connected on an informal level. Based on the results of the NA, it appears to be useful to initialize a community health facilitator to involve relevant stakeholders from the education, sports, and health systems in projects and to strive for the goal of sustainable health promotion, regardless of the rural or urban structure of the region. Participatory involvement of relevant stakeholders can have a positive influence on the effective dissemination of information and networking with other stakeholders.","Brauer, Katharina, Wulff, Hagen, Pawellek, Sabine, Ziegeldorf, Alexandra","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081501","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1501, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38067,""

"Emotion Regulation Flexibility and Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes: A Framework for Understanding Symptoms and Affect Dynamics in Pediatric Psycho-Oncology","Simple SummaryThe individualâ€™s ability to conceive and regulate the broad spectrum of their human emotions is closely linked to their mental health. The implications of a serious disease such as cancer represent an extraordinary burden to these internal coping mechanisms, especially in the case of young patients. Regarding their well-being and support, it is therefore of particular interest for caregivers to be able to follow the dynamics of the patientâ€™s emotional world and perceptions. Technical progress enables new possibilities for data collection through tools for digital patient self-reports while simultaneously creating new challenges. Within the scope of this article, we provide an overview of the literature on this topic, outlining the current strengths and weaknesses and possible perspectives on digital aids, especially in terms of capturing the flexibility, fluctuations and early detection of symptom changes.Emotion dysregulation is regarded as a driving mechanism for the development of mental health problems and psychopathology. The role of emotion regulation (ER) in the management of cancer distress and quality of life (QoL) has recently been recognized in psycho-oncology. The latest technological advances afford ways to assess ER, affective experiences and QoL in child, adolescent and young adult (CAYA) cancer patients through electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) in their daily environment in real-time. Such tools facilitate ways to study the dynamics of affect and the flexibility of ER. However, technological advancement is not risk-free. We critically review the literature on ePRO in cancer existing models of ER in pediatric psycho-oncology and analyze strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of ePRO with a focus on CAYA cancer research and care. Supported by personal study-based experiences, this narrative review serves as a foundation to propose a novel methodological and metatheoretical framework based on: (a) an extended notion of ER, which includes its dynamic, adaptive and flexible nature and focuses on processes and conditions rather than fixed categorical strategies;(b) ePRO as a means to measure emotion regulation flexibility and affect dynamics;(c) identifying early warning signals for symptom change via ePRO and building forecasting models using dynamical systems theory.","Mirzaie, Kasra, Burns-Gebhart, Anna, Meyerheim, Marcel, Sander, Annette, Graf, Norbert","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14163874","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cancers; 14(16):3874, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38070,""
"Anxiety and Depression: What Do We Know of Neuropeptides?","In modern society, there has been a rising trend of depression and anxiety. This trend heavily impacts the populationâ€™s mental health and thus contributes significantly to morbidity and, in the worst case, to suicides. Modern medicine, with many antidepressants and anxiolytics at hand, is still unable to achieve remission in many patients. The pathophysiology of depression and anxiety is still only marginally understood, which encouraged researchers to focus on neuropeptides, as they are a vast group of signaling molecules in the nervous system. Neuropeptides are involved in the regulation of many physiological functions. Some act as neuromodulators and are often co-released with neurotransmitters that allow for reciprocal communication between the brain and the body. Most studied in the past were the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of oxytocin, vasopressin or neuropeptide Y and S, or Substance P. However, in recent years, more and more novel neuropeptides have been added to the list, with implications for the research and development of new targets, diagnostic elements, and even therapies to treat anxiety and depressive disorders. In this review, we take a close look at all currently studied neuropeptides, their related pathways, their roles in stress adaptation, and the etiology of anxiety and depression in humans and animal models. We will focus on the latest research and information regarding these associated neuropeptides and thus picture their potential uses in the future.","Kupcova, Ida, Danisovic, Lubos, Grgac, Ivan, Harsanyi, Stefan","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12080262","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(8):262, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38071,""
"Validation of the Mental Health Literacy Scale in French University Students","Background: Mental health literacy is a determinant of mental health, which can facilitate early detection of psychological problems and endorse timely access to care. Instruments to measure mental health literacy exist, but not in French. Assessment of mental health literacy in young adults is essential to tailor appropriate educational interventions promoting psychological wellbeing and preventing mental health problems in this vulnerable population. The aim of this study was to validate the French version of the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS-FR) in university students. Methods: A total of 482 students from the University of Bordeaux, France, completed the translated version of the scale. Collected data were used to validate the MHLS-FR through psychometric analyses: descriptive statistics, item distribution, test-retest reliability, exploratory structural equation model, confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbachâ€™s alpha and McDonaldâ€™s omega coefficients, and hypothesis testing. Results: The final scale included 26 items covering 6 dimensions. Cronbachâ€™s alpha and McDonaldâ€™s omega coefficients were 0.744 and 0.961, respectively. With test-retest, about 50% of items had intraclass correlation coefficients superior to 0.5. Conclusions: The MHLS-FR can be considered as a valid and reliable instrument for measuring mental health literacy in French students.","Montagni, Ilaria, GonzÃ¡lez Caballero, Juan Luis","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12080259","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(8):259, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38072,""
"Dopamine and Beyond: Implications of Psychophysical Studies of Intracranial Self-Stimulation for the Treatment of Depression","Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability and suicide worldwide. Consecutive rounds of conventional interventions are ineffective in a significant sub-group of patients whose disorder is classified as treatment-resistant depression. Significant progress in managing this severe form of depression has been achieved through the use of deep brain stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The beneficial effect of such stimulation appears strong, safe, and enduring. The proposed neural substrate for this promising clinical finding includes midbrain dopamine neurons and a subset of their cortical afferents. Here, we aim to broaden the discussion of the candidate circuitry by exploring potential implications of a new â€œconvergenceâ€ model of brain reward circuitry in rodents. We chart the evolution of the new model from its predecessors, which held that midbrain dopamine neurons constituted an obligatory stage of the final common path for reward seeking. In contrast, the new model includes a directly activated, non-dopaminergic pathway whose output ultimately converges with that of the dopaminergic neurons. On the basis of the new model and the relative ineffectiveness of dopamine agonists in the treatment of depression, we ask whether non-dopaminergic circuitry may contribute to the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation of the MFB.","Pallikaras, Vasilios, Shizgal, Peter","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12081052","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 12(8):1052, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38073,""
"How comprehensive and effective are waste management policies during the COVID-19 pandemic? Perspectives from the Philippines","This study presents a comprehensive analysis on policies governing the management of COVID-19 waste in the Philippines, highlighting gaps in pre-existing policies and opportunities for further policy development and adaptation in the context of present and future public health emergencies. A hybrid search strategy and consultative process identified fifty (50) policy documents directly impacting the management of wastes (general domestic, healthcare, and household healthcare waste) released prior to and during the pandemic. Content analysis revealed comprehensive policy coverage on managing general domestic waste and healthcare waste. However, there remains a dearth in policies for managing household healthcare waste, an emerging category for waste generated by patients isolating at home or in isolation facilities. Applicable, pre-existing policies were neither adequate nor specific to this category, and may therefore be subjected to variable interpretation and mismanagement when applied to this novel waste category. Assessment using the modified Cradle-to-End-Of-Life (CTEOL) framework revealed adequate policy coverage across the waste lifecycle stages. However, policies on reducing waste generation were relatively minimal and outdated, and policy gaps in waste segregation led to downstream inefficiencies and introduction of environmental health risks in waste collection, treatment, and disposal. The internal validity of policies was also evaluated against eleven (11) criteria adapted from Rutten et al. and Cheung et al. The criteria analysis revealed strong fulfillment of ensuring policy accessibility, goal clarity, provision of human resources, and strength of policy background, but weak fulfillment of criteria on providing adequate financing, organizational capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, and encouragement of opportunities for public participation. We conclude that existing waste management policies in the Philippines leave much room for improvement to ensure effective management of COVID-19 waste from various settings and circumstances. Hence, these policies are expected to adapt and evolve over time, utilizing the best available technology and environmental practices. Integrated, region-wide waste management systems, involving both government and society, and strengthened by equitable provisional support are needed for effective waste management that is both inclusive and resilient in the face of present and future pandemics.","Apostol, G.

"The impact of postpartum obsessive-compulsive symptoms on child development and the mediating role of the parent-child relationship: A prospective longitudinal study","BackgroundThe first 2 years of life are a particularly sensitive period for the parent-child relationship as well as a healthy, age-appropriate child development. Both have been shown to be linked to postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms, while the role of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which are also common, is still largely understudied. In addition, fathers have been neglected in this area of research. This study, which includes both mothers and fathers, aims to investigate the longitudinal associations between postpartum obsessive-compulsive symptoms and different domains of child development, as well as the mediating role of the parent-child relationship. MethodsData were drawn from the prospective longitudinal study DREAM, with 674 mothers and 442 fathers from the general population completing self-report questionnaires at four measurement points. Longitudinal associations between parental postpartum obsessive-compulsive symptoms 8 weeks postpartum, the parent-child relationship 14 months postpartum, and child development 24 months postpartum were investigated using regression and mediation analyses. A number of potential confounding variables were considered, i.e., age, academic degree, postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms of the parents, preterm birth and temperament of the child, as well as COVID-19 pandemic-driven adversities. ResultsWhen adjusting for confounders, neither maternal nor paternal postpartum obsessive-compulsive symptoms had adverse effects on the respective parent-child relationship and child development. Further, no mediating role of the parent-child relationship between parental postpartum obsessive-compulsive symptoms and child development could be confirmed. Instead, we found that the mother- and father-child relationship were differentially related to specific child developmental domains. For mothers, a poorer mother-child relationship was prospectively related to poorer fine motor development. For fathers, a poorer father-child relationship prospectively predicted a poorer overall development as well as poorer gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal-social development. ConclusionOur results suggest that negative effects on the parent-child relationship and child development may only become apparent in full-blown postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder. Given the differential impact on specific developmental domains, our findings also suggest that it is crucial to consider both parents in clinical practice as well as in future research, rather than focusing only on the mother-child dyad.","Blum, S.; Mack, J.

"Modeling Socio-Economic Consequences of COVID-19: An Evidence From Bibliometric Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the world towards a digital era and affected the environment significantly. The present study uses a bibliometric approach to provide a comprehensive overview based on existing literature related to COVID-19 and E-learning and its environmental consequences, particularly from the year 2020-2022. In addition to the terrible impact of the pandemic on the world, environmental advantages have also been noticed. The findings show that the use of E-learning reduces the consumption of paper and prevents the cutting of trees which makes the environment more sustainable. The optimum use of technology leads to the conservation of the environment. Second, E-learning ensures developing and less developing countries to provide education at lower levels or remote areas of the society. The findings also suggest that governments and educational institutions should upgrade technology and digital tools in order to enhance E-learning education. Additionally, reviewing 1807 published articles extracted from the SCOPUS database, enrich literature related to COVID-19, E-learning, and the environment. This study also represents a graphical visualization of the bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R studio software. A coupling map and three-field plot also have been used for directions for future research.","Ansari, Y.; Arwab, M.; Subhan, M.; Alam, M. S.; Hashmi, N. I.; Hisam, M. W.; Zameer, M.

"Willingness to Use Internet-Based Versus Bibliotherapy Interventions in a Representative US Sample: Cross-sectional Survey Study","Background: Self-help interventions have the potential to increase access to evidence-based mental health care. Self-help can be delivered via different formats, including print media or digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, we do not know which delivery format is more likely to result in higher engagement. Objective: The aims of this study were to identify if there is a preference for engaging in print media versus DMHIs and whether there are individual differences in relative preferences. Methods: Participants were 423 adults between the ages of 18 and 82 years (201/423, 47.5% female) recruited on Prolific as a nationally representative sample of the US population, including non-Hispanic White (293/423, 69.2%), non-Hispanic Black (52/423, 12%), Asian (31/423, 7%), Hispanic (25/423, 6%), and other individuals (22/423, 5%). We provided individuals with psychoeducation in different self-help formats and measured their willingness to use print media versus DMHIs. We also assessed participantsâ€™ demographics, personality, and perception of each formatâ€™s availability and helpfulness and used these to predict individual differences in the relative preferences. Results: Participants reported being more willing to engage with print media than with DMHIs (B=0.41, SE 0.08;t422=4.91;P&lt;.001;d=0.24, 95% CI 0.05-0.43). This preference appeared to be influenced by education level (B=0.22, SE 0.09;t413=2.41;P=.02;d=0.13, 95% CI â€“0.06 to 0.32), perceived helpfulness (B=0.78, SE 0.06;t411=13.66;P&lt;.001;d=0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.66), and perceived availability (B=0.20, SE 0.58;t411=3.25;P=.001;d=0.12, 95% CI 0.07-0.30) of the self-help format. Conclusions: This study suggests an overall preference for print media over DMHIs. Future work should investigate whether receiving mental health treatment via participantsâ€™ preferred delivery format can lead to higher engagement.","Robinson De, JesÃºs-Romero, Wasil, Akash, Lorenzo-Luaces, Lorenzo","https://doi.org/10.2196/39508","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(8), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38077,""
"Insights Into Needs and Preferences for Mental Health Support on Social Media and Through Mobile Apps Among Black Male University Students: Exploratory Qualitative Study","Background: Black college-aged men are less likely than their peers to use formal, therapeutic in-person services for mental health concerns. As the use of mobile technologies and social media platforms is steadily increasing, it is important to conduct work that examines the future utility of digital tools and technologies to improve access to and uptake of mental health services for Black men and Black men in college. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and understand college-attending Black menâ€™s needs and preferences for using digital health technologies and social media for stress and mental health symptom management. Methods: Interviews were conducted with Black male students (N=11) from 2 racially diverse universities in the Midwestern United States. Participants were asked questions related to their current mental health needs and interest in using social media platforms and mobile-based apps for their mental health concerns. A thematic analysis was conducted. Results: Four themes emerged from the data: current stress relief strategies, technology-based support needs and preferences (subthemes: mobile-based support and social mediaâ€“based support), resource information dissemination considerations (subthemes: information-learning expectations and preferences and information-sharing preferences and behaviors), and technology-based mental health support design considerations (subtheme: relatability and representation). Participants were interested in using social media and digital technologies for their mental health concerns and needs, for example, phone notifications and visual-based mental health advertisements that promote awareness. Relatability in the context of representation was emphasized as a key factor for participants interested in using digital mental health tools. Examples of methods for increasing relatability included having tools disseminated by minority-serving organizations and including components explicitly portraying Black men engaging in mental health support strategies. The men also discussed wanting to receive recommendations for stress relief that have been proven successful, particularly for Black men. Conclusions: The findings from this study provide insights into design and dissemination considerations for future work geared toward developing mental health messaging and digital interventions for young Black men.","Williams, Kofoworola D.

"Health Care Workersâ€™ Need for Headspace: Findings From a Multisite Definitive Randomized Controlled Trial of an Unguided Digital Mindfulness-Based Self-help App to Reduce Healthcare Worker Stress","Background: Health care workers experience high stress. Accessible, affordable, and effective approaches to reducing stress are lacking. In-person mindfulness-based interventions can reduce health care worker stress but are not widely available or accessible to busy health care workers. Unguided, digital, mindfulness-based self-help (MBSH) interventions show promise and can be flexibly engaged with. However, their effectiveness in reducing health care worker stress has not yet been explored in a definitive trial. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an unguided digital MBSH app (Headspace) in reducing health care worker stress. Methods: This was a definitive superiority randomized controlled trial with 2182 National Health Service staff in England recruited on the web and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to fully automated Headspace (n=1095, 50.18%) or active control (Moodzone;n=1087, 49.82%) for 4.5 months. Outcomes were subscales of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (primary outcome) Scale short form;Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale;Maslach Burnout Inventory;15-item Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire minus Observe items;Self-Compassion Scaleâ€“Short Form;Compassionate Love Scale;Penn State Worry Questionnaire;Brooding subscale of the Ruminative Response Scale;and sickness absence. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses found that Headspace led to greater reductions in stress over time than Moodzone (b=â€“0.31, 95% CI â€“0.47 to â€“0.14;P&lt;.001), with small effects. Small effects of Headspace versus Moodzone were found for depression (b=â€“0.24, 95% CI â€“0.40 to â€“0.08;P=.003), anxiety (b=â€“0.19, 95% CI â€“0.32 to â€“0.06;P=.004), well-being (b=0.14, 95% CI 0.05-0.23;P=.002), mindfulness (b=0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.34;P=.001), self-compassion (b=0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.64;P&lt;.001), compassion for others (b=0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.04;P=.04), and worry (b=â€“0.30, 95% CI â€“0.51 to â€“0.09;P=.005) but not for burnout (b=â€“0.19, â€“0.04, and 0.13, all 95% CIs &gt;0;P=.65, .67, and .35), ruminative brooding (b=â€“0.06, 95% CI â€“0.12 to 0.00;P=.06), or sickness absence (<U+03B3>=0.09, 95% CI â€“0.18 to 0.34). Per-protocol effects of Headspace (454/1095, 41.46%) versus Moodzone (283/1087, 26.03%) over time were found for stress, self-compassion, and compassion for others but not for the other outcomes. Engagement (practice days per week) and improvements in self-compassion during the initial 1.5-month intervention period mediated pre- to postintervention improvements in stress. Improvements in mindfulness, rumination, and worry did not mediate pre- to postintervention improvements in stress. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: An unguided digital MBSH intervention (Headspace) can reduce health care workersâ€™ stress. Effect sizes were small but could have population-level benefits. Unguided digital MBSH interventions can be part of the solution to reducing health care worker stress alongside potentially costlier but potentially more effective in-person mindfulness-based interventions, nonmindfulness courses, and organizational-level interventions.

"Self-help Digital Interventions Targeted at Improving Psychological Well-being in Young People With Perceived or Clinically Diagnosed Reduced Well-being: Systematic Review","Background: Levels of well-being are declining, whereas rates of mental health problems remain high in young people. The World Health Organization defines mental health as not merely the absence of mental disorder but also includes social and psychological well-being as integral to positive mental health, highlighting that mental health is applicable to young people with mental health conditions and those without a diagnosis of a mental health condition. Reduced mental well-being have been identified in studies of young people with clinical populations, as well as in populations consisting of nonclinical young people. Self-help digital interventions can be delivered at mass at a low cost and without the need for trained input, thereby facilitating access to support for well-being. Self-help interventions are effective in young people with mental health conditions, but systematic reviews of such studies have been limited to randomized controlled trials, have not included reduced well-being as an inclusion criterion, and do not consider engagement factors such as retention. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review all controlled studies of digitally delivered, self-administered interventions for young people aged 9 to 25 years, with perceived or clinically diagnosed reduced psychological well-being. Participant retention and effectiveness of the interventions were also explored. Methods: A systematic search of the PsycInfo, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases from inception to 2021, reference searches of relevant papers, and gray literature was carried out for digitally controlled studies conducted with young people with perceived or clinically diagnosed reduced well-being, aimed at improving psychological well-being. Data were extracted to identify the effectiveness and retention rates of the interventions and the quality of the studies. Results: Overall, 1.04% (12/1153) of studies met the inclusion criteria: 83% (10/12) of studies were randomized controlled trials and 17% (2/12) were controlled pre-post studies. Most (6/12, 50%) studies aimed to improve symptoms of depression;3 interventions aimed at both anxiety and depressive symptoms and 2 studies aimed at improving social functioning difficulties. Owing to the high risk of bias across interventions and lack of similar outcome measures, a meta-analysis was not conducted. Retention rates across studies were regarded as good, with moderate to high retention. Overall, the findings indicated that predominantly self-administered self-help interventions improved well-being in the areas targeted by the intervention and identified additional areas of well-being that were positively affected by interventions. Few interventions supported psychological well-being that was different from those used by young people with a clinical diagnosis of mental illness or young people from neurodiverse backgrounds. Conclusions: The findings, along with the advantages of self-help interventions, highlight the need for upscaling self-help interventions to better support vulnerable populations of young people who experience poor psychological well-being.

With regard to the future, our findings suggest renewed focus towards attracting domestic tourists through the increasing use of technology and workforce restructuring are major thrust areas.","Majumdar, R.","https://doi.org/10.1504/IJICBM.2021.10040974","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Indian Culture and Business Management; 26(4):521-537, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38082,""
"Trends In Mental Health Care Delivery By Psychiatrists And Nurse Practitioners In Medicare, 2011â€“19","The supply of psychiatrists in the United States is inadequate to address the unmet demand for mental health care. Psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) may fill the widening gap between supply of and demand for mental health specialists with prescribing privileges. Using Medicare claims for a 100 percent sample of fee-forservice beneficiaries (average age, sixty-one years) who had an office visit for either a psychiatrist or a PMHNP during the period 2011-19, we examined how the supply and use of psychiatrists and PMHNPs changed over time, and we compared their practice patterns. Psychiatrists and PMHNPs treated roughly comparable patient populations with similar services and prescriptions. From 2011 to 2019 the number of PMHNPs treating Medicare beneficiaries grew 162 percent, compared with a 6 percent relative decrease in the number of psychiatrists doing so. During the same period, total annual mental health office visits per 100 beneficiaries decreased 11.5 percent from 27.4 to 24.2, the net result of a 29.0 percent drop in psychiatrist visits being offset by a 111.3 percent increase in PMHNP visits. The proportion of all mental health prescriber visits provided by PMHNPs increased from 12.5 percent to 29.8 percent during 2011-19, exceeding 50 percent in rural, full-scope-of-practice regions. PMHNPs are a rapidly growing workforce that may be instrumental in improving mental health care access.","Cai, Arno, Mehrotra, Ateev, Germack, Hayley D.; Busch, Alisa B.; Huskamp, Haiden A.; Barnett, Michael L.","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00289","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Affairs; 41(9):1222-10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38083,""
"Social predictors of doctoral student mental health and well-being","Graduate studentsâ€™ mental health and well-being is a prominent concern across various disciplines. However, early predictors of mental health and well-being in graduate education, specifically doctoral education, have rarely been studied. The present study evaluated both the underlying latent classification of individualsâ€™ mental well-being and predictors of those classifications. Results estimated two latent classes of studentsâ€™ mental health and well-being: one class with generally high levels of mental well-being and one with lower levels of mental well-being. Regression analyses showed that mentoring in the second year of doctoral study, certainty of choice in the third year, and both academic development and sense of belonging in the fourth year were positive predictors of membership in the higher mental well-being class. In contrast to some prior studies, demographic variables were not related to the identified well-being classifications. Regression analyses further showed that mental well-being was negatively related to participantsâ€™ number of publications and research self-efficacy, indicating a problematic relationship between scholarly productivity and confidence and well-being. These findings may be used to identify and provide targeted support for students who are at-risk for having or developing lower levels of mental well-being in their graduate programs.","Zhang, Feng, Litson, Kaylee, Feldon, David F.","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274273","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38084,""
"Pattern of substance use and substance use disorder in adolescent learners at public secondary schools in Gaborone, Botswana","Introduction Substance use amongst adolescents remains a global public health challenge. The potential negative health outcomes of substance use suggest the need to understand the pattern of use and the associated factors among adolescents. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of substance use, SUDs, and PD and the associated factors in adolescent learners at public schools in Gaborone, Botswana. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at 13 public secondary schools in Gaborone among 742 students. Assessment tools included the World Health Organization drug questionnaire, DSM-5 interview for SUD, and the General Health Questionnaire-12. Results The mean age (SD) of the participants was 15.26 (1.57) years, and there were more females (55.5%). Over two-fifths (44.6%) of learners reported psychoactive substance use in the past 12 months, and 31.5% meeting DSM 5 criteria for a SUD. Alcohol was the most used psychoactive substance (25.1%). Male gender (AOR = 1.94;95% CI: 1.26â€“2.995), having a friend (AOR = 4.27;95% CI: 2.68â€“6.78), or father (AOR = 1.87;95% CI: 1.14â€“3.04), who uses substance, and higher levels of PD (AOR = 1.09;95% CI: 1.03â€“1.17) remained significantly associated with SUD. Regular participation in religious activities negatively correlated with SUD (AOR = 0.61;95% CI: 0.38â€“0.96). Conclusion The high prevalence of substance use and SUDs among in-school adolescents is concerning. Substance use programs need to include family-focused and religious-based therapy and youth empowerment in developing positive peer relationships. Also, they should be integrated with mental health screening to assess comorbid PD.","Olashore, Anthony A.; Paruk, Saeeda, Maphorisa, Taboka, Mosupiemang, Boitshepo","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268961","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38085,""
"Stigma and discrimination tendencies towards COVID-19 survivors: evidence from a nationwide population-based survey in Ghana","Historically, infectious diseases have generated fears among populations. Unhealthy handling of these fears result in the stigma and discrimination of infected patients. Globally, measures taken so far by governments to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, although helpful, have created fears in people. Consequently, there are reported Ghanaian media cases of stigmatisation against persons who were infected and recovered from COVID-19. However, these reports remain unsubstantiated. This study, therefore, sought to examine stigma and discriminatory tendencies towards COVID-19 survivors among the adult population in Ghana. This was a population-based cross-sectional study among 3,259 adults. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Descriptive and inferential statistics comprising frequency, percentage, chi-square, and multivariable logistic regression were employed in analysing the data. Knowledge on COVID-19 was poor among 33.6% of the participants. Forty-three per cent had a good attitude towards COVID-19. Nearly half (45.9%) exhibited stigma and discriminatory tendencies towards COVID-19 survivors. Participants who had poor COVID-19 related knowledge (aOR = 1.91, 95%CI = 1.59-2.29, p&lt;0.001) and poor attitude towards COVID-19 (aOR = 5.83, 95% CI = 4.85-6.98, p &lt; 0.001) were more likely to exhibit stigma and discriminatory tendencies towards COVID-19 survivors. Our study found relatively high proportions of poor knowledge and negative attitudes towards COVID-19. Stigma and discriminatory tendencies were consequently high. Our findings call for increased public education on COVID-19 by the Ghana Health Service and the Information Services Department, to increase the level of knowledge on the pandemic while reducing stigma and discrimination associated with it.","Osei, E.; Amu, H.; Appiah, P.

"Psychological and situational factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention among postpartum women in Pakistan: a cross-sectional study","Contributing factors to COVID-19 vaccination intention in low-income and middle-income countries have received little attention. This study examined COVID-19-related anxiety and obsessive thoughts and situational factors associated with Pakistani postpartum women's intention to get COVID-19 vaccination. Cross-sectional study administering a survey by a telephone interview format between 15 July and 10 September 2020. Four centres of Aga Khan Hospital for Women and Children-Garden, Kharadar, Karimabad and Hyderabad-in Sindh Province, Pakistan. Women who were enrolled in our longitudinal Pakistani cohort study were approached (n=1395), and 990Ã¢â‚¬â€°women (71%) participated in the survey, of which 941Ã¢â‚¬â€°women who were in their postpartum period were included in the final analysis. COVID-19 vaccine intention, sociodemographic and COVID-19-related factors, Coronavirus anxiety, obsession with COVID-19 and work and social adjustment were assessed. Multiple multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with women's intentions. Most women would accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (66.7%). Only 24.4% of women were undecided about vaccination against COVID-19, and a small number of women rejected the COVID-19 vaccine (8.8%). Women with primary education were less likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine willingly than those with higher education. COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were predicted by having no experience of COVID-19 infection, childbirth during the pandemic, having no symptoms of Coronavirus anxiety and obsession with COVID-19. Predictors for women's intention to vaccinate themselves and their children against COVID-19 were similar. Understanding the factors shaping women's intention to vaccinate themselves or their children would enable evidence-based strategies by healthcare providers to enhance the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine and achieve herd immunity against Coronavirus.","Premji, Khademi, Forcheh, Lalani, Shaikh, Javed, Saleem, Babar, Muhabat, Jabeen, Nausheen, Shahid Ali, Aijaz, Ali, Dosani, Schetter, Faisal, Ghani, Hashmani, Jehan, Ishtiaq, Jabeen, Khoja, Letourneau, Lohana, Merali, Mian, Musana, Namdave, Naugler, Okoko, Omuse, Pardhan, Samia, Shamim, Siddiqui, Sulaiman, Tariq, Wanyonyi, Yim","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063469","20220922","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; perinatology; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38089,""
"Excess deaths from COVID-19 among Medicare beneficiaries with psychiatric diagnoses: community versus nursing home","Psychiatric illness may pose an additional risk of death for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults in the community versus institutions might be influenced by the pandemic differently. This study examines excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic among Medicare beneficiaries with and without psychiatric diagnoses (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) in the community versus nursing homes. This is a retrospective cohort study of a 20% random sample of 15,229,713 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, from January 2019 through December 2021. Unadjusted monthly mortality risks, COVID-19 infection rates, and case-fatality rates after COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated. Excess deaths in 2020, compared to 2019 were estimated from multivariable logistic regressions. Of all included Medicare beneficiaries in 2020 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5,140,619), 28.9% had a psychiatric diagnosis; 1.7% lived in nursing homes. In 2020, there were 246,422 observed deaths, compared to 215,264 expected, representing a 14.5% increase over expected. Patients with psychiatric diagnoses had more excess deaths than those without psychiatric diagnoses (1,107 vs. 403 excess deaths per 100,000 beneficiaries, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The largest increases in mortality risks were observed among patients with schizophrenia (32.4% increase) and bipolar disorder (25.4% increase). The pandemic-associated increase in deaths with psychiatric diagnoses was only found in the community, not in nursing homes. The increased mortality for patients with psychiatric diagnoses was limited to those with medical comorbidities. The increase in mortality for psychiatric diagnoses was associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates (1-year infection rateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.9% vs. 4.2% in 2020), rather than excess case fatality. Excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic were disproportionally greater in beneficiaries with psychiatric diagnoses, at least in part due to higher infection rates. Policy interventions should focus on preventing COVID-19 infections and deaths among community-dwelling patients with major psychiatric disorders in addition to those living the nursing homes.","Xu, Li, Mehta, Hommel, Goodwin","https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18062","20220922","COVID-19; epidemiology; excess deaths; nursing home; psychiatric diagnoses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38090,""
"Prevalence of Chronic Diseases, Depression, and Stress Among US Childcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Given their central role in supporting children's development, childcare professionals' overall physical and mental health is important. We evaluated the prevalence of chronic diseases, depression, and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among US childcare professionals. Data were obtained from US childcare professionals (N = 81,682) through an online survey from May 22, 2020, through June 8, 2020. We used multivariable logistic and linear regression models to assess the association of sociodemographic characteristics with 4 physical health conditions (asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity), depression, and stress weighted to national representativeness. For physical health conditions, 14.3% (n = 11,717) reported moderate to severe asthma, 6.5% (n = 5,317) diabetes, 4.9% (n = 3,971) heart disease, and 19.8% (n = 16,207) obesity. For mental health, 45.7% (n = 37,376) screened positive for depression and 66.5% (n = 54,381) reported moderate to high stress levels. Race, ethnicity, and sex/gender disparities were found for physical health conditions but not mental health of childcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlighted that childcare professionals' depression rates during the pandemic were higher than before the pandemic, and depression, stress, and asthma rates were higher than rates among US adults overall during the pandemic. Given the essential work childcare professionals provided during the pandemic, policy makers and public health officials should consider what can be done to support their physical and mental health.","Elharake, Shafiq, Cobanoglu, Malik, Klotz, Humphries, Murray, Patel, Wilkinson, Yildirim, Diaz, Rojas, Kuperwajs Cohen, Lee, Omer, Gilliam","https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd19.220132","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38091,""
"Workplace violence, bullying, burnout, job satisfaction and their correlation with depression among Bangladeshi nurses: A cross-sectional survey during the COVID-19 pandemic","Depression is one of the most serious yet understudied issues among Bangladeshi nurses, bringing health dangers to this workforce. This study aimed to investigate how workplace violence (WPV), bullying, burnout, and job satisfaction are correlated with depression and identify the factors associated with depression among Bangladeshi nurses. For this cross-sectional study, data were collected between February 26, 2021, and July 10, 2021 from the Bangladeshi registered nurses. The Workplace Violence Scale (WPVS), the Short Negative Acts Questionnaire [S-NAQ], the Burnout Measure-Short version (BMS), the Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS-5), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure WPV, bullying, burnout, job satisfaction, and depression, respectively. Inferential statistics include Pearson's correlation test, t-test, one-way ANOVA test, multiple linear regression, and multiple hierarchal regression analyses were performed. The study investigated 1,264 nurses (70.02% female) with an average age of 28.41 years (SD = 5.54). Depression was positively correlated with WPV, bullying, and burnout and negatively correlated with job satisfaction (p &lt;0.001). According to the multiple linear regression model, depression was significantly lower among nurses with diploma degrees (ÃŽÂ² = -1.323, 95% CI = -2.149 to -0.497) and bachelor's degrees (ÃŽÂ² = -1.327, 95% CI = -2.131 to- 0.523) compared to the nurses with master's degree. The nurses who worked extended hours (&gt;48 hours) had a significantly higher depression score (ÃŽÂ² = 1.490, 95% CI = 0.511 to 2.470) than those who worked Ã¢â€°Â¤ 36 hours. Depression was found to be significantly higher among those who did not receive a timely salary (ÃŽÂ² = 2.136, 95% CI = 1.138 to 3.134), rewards for good works (ÃŽÂ² = 1.862, 95% CI = 1.117 to 2.607), and who had no training on WPV (ÃŽÂ² = 0.895, 95% CI = 0.092 to 1.698). Controlling burnout, bullying, and workplace violence, as well as improving the work environment for nurses and increasing job satisfaction, are the essential indicators of reducing depression. This can be accomplished with integrative support from hospital executives, policymakers, and government officials.","Chowdhury, Kabir, Mazumder, Akter, Chowdhury, Hossain","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274965","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38092,""
"Incidence rate of psychiatric disorders in 2020: The pivotal role played by SARS-CoV-2 infection","The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted mental health outcomes. While the frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms has increased in the whole population, the relationship between COVID-19 and new psychiatric diagnoses remains unclear. To compare the population incidence rate of emergence of de novo psychiatric disorders in 2020 compared to the previous years, and to compare the incidence rate of new psychiatric disorder diagnoses between people with vs without COVID-19. This study utilized administrative claims data from the ClinformaticsÃ‚Â® Data Mart database, licensed from OptumÃ‚Â®. The study is a cross-sectional analysis that compared the incidence rate of new psychiatric disorders in 2020 vs. 2018 and 2019 in the entire insured population database. Subsequently, the incidence of new psychiatric disorders in people with vs. without COVID-19 during 2020 was analyzed. The exposures included diagnosis and severity of COVID-19 infection. The dependent variables of interest were the incidence rates of new psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The population studied included 10,463,672 US adults (mean age 52.83, 52% female) who were unique people for the year of 2020. Incidence of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders per 1,000 individuals in the 2020 whole population were 28.81 (CI: 28.71, 28.92) for anxiety disorders, 1.04 (CI: 1.02, 1.06) for schizophrenia disorders, 0.42 (CI: 0.41, 0.43) for OCD and 28.85 (CI: 28.75, 28.95) for mood disorders. These rates were not significantly higher than 2018 or 2019. When comparing incidence rates between COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19 populations in 2020, the rates were significantly higher in the COVID-19 population: 46.89 (CI: 46.24, 47.53) for anxiety, 49.31 (CI: 48.66, 49.97) for mood disorders, 0.57 (CI: 0.50, 0.65) for OCD, and 3.52 (CI: 3.34, 3.70) for schizophrenia. COVID-19 severity was significantly associated with new diagnoses of schizophrenia, anxiety and mood disorders in multivariate analyses. Compared to 2018 and 2019, in 2020 there was no increased incidence of new psychiatric disorders in the general population based on insurance claims data. Importantly, people with COVID-19 were more likely to be diagnosed with a new psychiatric disorder, most notably disorders with psychosis, indicating a potential association between COVID-19 and mental/brain health.","Teixeira, Hansen, Wozny, Schaefer, Machado-Vieira, Shahani, Lane, Soares, Krause","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274330","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38093,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on students' mental health: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic is currently one of the biggest public health threats for people's mental health. A particularly endangered group were students, who became highly affected by measures of social distance due to their active lifestyle. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to assess the level of self-reported stress, anxiety and depression of the student population in Serbia, in relation to demographic characteristics, living and studying conditions, students' activities during the epidemic, potential coronavirus infection and general, mental and physical health. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 580 undergraduate medical students from the University of Belgrade during the 2020/2021 school year. Mental health data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to examine the association between independent variables with the dependent variable mental health. Women made up the majority of the sample with 80.3%. A total of 64.5%, 66.8% and 66.7% of students between the ages of 21 and 30 had severe depressive symptoms, severe degree of anxiety, and a severe degree of stress, respectively. Women almost twice as often (OR = 1.89) assessed their anxiety as severe and almost two and a half times more (OR = 2.39) perceived stress as severe compared to men. Students who lived with their families during studies two and a half times (OR = 2.57) more often assessed their stress as severe, compared to students who lived alone. Fifth- and sixth-year students were less likely to rate depression and anxiety as serious than the first-year students. Medical students reported their health as severely impaired in terms of depression, anxiety and stress reactions. The results indicate the need to launch a mental health program in the form of counseling and emotional support to students affected by the pandemic.","MiriloviÃ„â€¡, JankoviÃ„â€¡, Latas","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275167","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38094,""
"The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder and its associated factors among frontline health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic working at case management center in Ethiopia, 2020","COVID-19, because of its rapid transmission and the uncertainty about how it is transmitted, evoked fear and anxiety among frontline health professionals. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its association with impairments in functioning and comorbid mental health symptoms in Ethiopia in 2020. An English-language, online, cross-sectional survey study was administered to 207 different health professionals working at a COVID-19 center using a random sampling technique. The 17-item Symptom Scale for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Self-Reporting Version was used to determine the presence of PTSD. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine psychosocial factors associated with PTSD. The overall prevalence of PTSD in this study was 55 (26.5%). Those at the highest risk included women, those working at a high-risk site, current substance users, and professionals with poor quality of sleep. The prevalence of PTSD among frontline health care providers was higher than in the general population. Some environmental and psychological variables were associated with increased risk. We recommend that health care providers who provide frontline care be regularly screened for PTSD and provided with mental health services.

"The Use of Information Communication Technologies in a South African Deaf Older Adult Population Living in a Residential Care Home to Communicate with Emigrant Family Members","South Africa has experienced considerable international outward migration in the last half century, which has had a severe psychological impact on members of families affected by this phenomenon. Older parents who remain behind may experience feelings of loss and isolation. Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are useful in maintaining relationships between family members separated by migration and increasingly allow migrant families to experience a virtual co-presence despite geographical separation. However, the process may be challenging, especially for older people with hearing difficulties. This article reports on a qualitative study exploring the perceptions of a group of older adults who have difficulty hearing and who live in a residential care home about using ICTs to communicate with family abroad. Interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. Most of the participants used either a fixed line telephone or a mobile phone. They reported challenges in communicating with family members abroad arising from their deafness, as well as difficulties using technological devices together with their hearing aids. These challenges resulted in feelings of helplessness and frustration. Although the data collection took place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these findings may be of particular relevance to situations such as those during the pandemic when many older adults became more reliant on technology to communicate with family members because of restrictions on direct contact. Accordingly, suggestions are made to address challenges in communication between older adults and loved ones who are geographically separated.","de Andrade, Marchetti-Mercer, Omar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10823-022-09457-z","20220922","COVID-19; ICTs; deafness; migration; older adults; residential care homes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38096,""
"Examining Healthcare Professionals' Telehealth Usability before and during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study","COVID-19 has placed substantial stress on healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia as they struggle to avoid contracting the virus, provide continued care for their patients, and protect their own families at home from possible exposure. The demand for care has increased due to the need to treat COVID-19. This pandemic has created a surge in the need for care in select healthcare delivery specialties, forcing other nonurgent or elective care to halt or transition to telehealth. This study provides a timely description of how COVID-19 affected employment, telehealth usage, and interprofessional collaboration. The STROBE checklist was used. We developed a cross-sectional online survey design that is rooted and grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The TAM model allows us to identify characteristics that affect the use of telehealth technologies. The survey was deployed in November 2021 to local healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. There were 66 individuals in the final sample. Both interprofessional satisfaction on frequency and quality were positively correlated with the frequency of interactions. The odds for satisfaction of frequency and quality were about 12 times (OR = 12.27) and 8 times 110 (OR = 8.24) more, respectively, for the participants with more than three times of interaction than the participants with no interaction at all. We also found that change in telehealth usage during the pandemic was positively associated with the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) scores. The estimated score for the participants who reported an increase in telehealth usage was 5.37, while the scores were lower for the participants reporting 'no change' and 'decreased usage'. Additional training on telehealth use and integration to improve interprofessionalism is needed.","Alzahrani, Zakari, Abuabah, Ousman, Xu, Hamadi","https://doi.org/10.3390/nursrep12030064","20220922","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; interprofessionalism; telehealth; usability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38097,""
"Well-being and experiences of adults in German federal states under pandemic conditions","Research on people's experiences during the Covid-19-pandemic provides growing evidence on subjective well-being and distress under pandemic conditions, however mainly at a country, not state level. The relationship between positive and negative experiences is described in Diener's conceptualization of subjective well-being. We assumed that people who experience well-being and positive affect through connectedness with nature, and social support during the pandemic feel relatively less alone, distressed, depressed, self-focused, and thoughtless. We further assumed changes in these constructs during the pandemic. The aim of this research was to examine the concurrent relationships between these positive and negative experiences of German adults simultaneously as well as their changes over 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks in 2020. Owing to German federalism, we expected these changes to differ between German states. A sample of 1,038 adults responded to an online questionnaire twice (April and May 2020). A structural equation model including 16 factors and 12 covariates yielded the expected negative relationships and different mild change effects between the German states. For example, adults' connectedness with nature increased while loneliness and distress decreased in Saxony, whereas thoughtlessness increased in Bavaria. The results imply a new finding that different changes in adults' positive and negative experiences during the pandemic exist.","Wolgast, Bruns, Werner, Reinhaus","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12402","20220922","connectedness with nature; loneliness; pandemic conditions; social perspective-taking; stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38098,""
"Research of the Coronavirus Anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Quality of Life, and Stress Coping Styles in COVID-19 Survivors","The COVID-19 survivors suffer from severe psychosocial challenges related to the current pandemic. In this context, it was aimed to evaluate the coronavirus anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and also determine the quality of life (QOL), and coping styles with stress in survivors by comparing them with non-COVID controls (NCs). This study was conducted from April 15 to October 15, 2021, as a cross-sectional study design. The study included 339 survivors who were confirmed with COVID-19 through clinical tests in the last 3 months and 321 NCs who had not been infected with COVID-19. Besides sociodemographic and clinical data, a set of valid and reliable assessment tools were used to measure outcomes of coronavirus anxiety, coping styles, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, and quality of life. The total scores of IES-R, GAD-7, and CAS were significantly higher in survivors than in the NCs. These results revealed that survivors manifested higher levels of coronavirus anxiety, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). In survivors,Ã‚ the rates of GAD and coronavirus anxiety were found to be 59.3% and 25.7%, respectively. Additionally, the majority of survivors (89.4%) reported the severity of anxiety as moderate to severe, and also almost two-thirds of them reported the psychological impact of the pandemic as moderate to severe. Furthermore, survivors were found to have a lower quality of life. The findings of this study indicate that survivors experienced higher levels of coronavirus anxiety, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, and had lower QOL. In addition, it was determined that survivors haven't been using active styles adequately in coping with stress. Thus, psychological intervention studies should be conducted and public mental health strategies should be developed. Providing psychosocial support and psychological guidance will contribute to mental health well-being, and improve the QOL and coping strategies.","Korkut","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221129131","20220922","COVID-19 survivors; coping styles; coronavirus anxiety; generalized anxiety disorder; post-traumatic stress; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38099,""

"Social participation and self-reported depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased depressive symptoms and disrupted activities that might typically mitigate depressive symptoms. Pandemic restrictions to social participation that supports well-being in older adults may contribute to worse mental health outcomes, but how participation relates to pandemic depressive symptoms is unclear. Using longitudinal data from the nationally representative National Health and Aging Trends Study (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3181), we assessed whether older adults' pandemic depressive symptoms were associated with participation in paid work, volunteering, religious services, and other organized activities during the pandemic, as well as changes in participation in these activities compared to pre-pandemic engagement. Of participation during the pandemic, only attending religious services predicted pandemic depression, with religious attendance associated with higher risk of mild pandemic depressive symptoms. However, for changes in participation, stopping paid work during the pandemic predicted higher risk of moderate/severe pandemic depressive levels, while stopping attending religious services predicted lower risk of mild pandemic depression. This work demonstrates the importance of social participation for mental health and indicates what types of disruptions may reduce integration to increase older adults' vulnerability to depressive symptoms during a global pandemic.","Copeland, Nowak, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2126821","20220922","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; older adults; participation; social integration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38101,""

Associations between QoL and care burden, care competence, social support, and resilience, and changes over time were analysed using (logistic) regressions. No significant changes in overall QoL nor its domains were found. Care burden was negatively associated with QoL and increased during the pandemic. Care competence was lower than in 2019. Competence, social support, and resilience were positively associated with QoL. Although relatives' QoL remained stable, the pandemic poses non-negligible risks to their wellbeing. It is, therefore, crucial to provide relatives with adequate support.","Zonneveld, van Schelven, Boeije","https://doi.org/10.1111/jar.13035","20220922","COVID-19; family; intellectual disability; mental health; quality of life; relatives","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38102,""
"Mental health and wellbeing of seafaring personnel during COVID-19: Scoping review","We aimed to synthesize published literature on seafarers' mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review searched four electronic databases for literature on the mental health and wellbeing of seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fourteen studies were included in the review. Few reported on the prevalence of mental health conditions. Only one compared mental health data gathered during the pandemic to pre-pandemic matched samples, suggesting symptoms of depression and anxiety were greater during the pandemic. There was some evidence that mental health worsened with longer stays on board during the pandemic and being on board longer than expected. Crew exchange difficulties forced many participants to extend their contracts or delay repatriation, often with little information as to when they might get to go home, leading them to feel they had no control over their lives and causing concern about fatigue and the potential for accidents and injuries. Participants described other challenges such as denial of shore leave; concerns about finances and future employment; loneliness and isolation; fears of COVID-19 infection; limited access to essential supplies; and feeling unsupported by management. Maritime organizations must understand how best to support their staff in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and in any other prolonged crises that may arise in the future.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Postpartum Depression and the Responsibility of the Healthcare System","Peripartum depression is a common complication of pregnancy with the potential for dangerous consequences to maternal and infant health if left untreated. The disorder was previously classified as a global public health issue due to the high prevalence of the disorder and the mismatch between available treatment options and successful completion of those options. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased the incidence of mental health disorders globally, with an even greater effect on peripartum mothers. A preliminary study on fetal implications suggests the resulting increased maternal stress and depressive mood symptoms correlates to worsened fetal brain development. The pandemic highlighted existing barriers to the treatment of peripartum mood disorders. The drastic increase in the use of telemedicine as a modality of treatment in response to the public health crisis has the potential to address some of these barriers. Future global disasters are inevitable with peripartum mothers highly susceptible to worsened mental health outcomes. We are thusÃ‚Â highlighting the responsibility of clinicians, professional organizations, and policymakers to support, identify, and facilitate the treatment of postpartum depression for this vulnerable population to prevent short-term and long-term repercussions.","DiGregory, Githere, Crites, Rouse, Shanks","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.27805","20220922","covid 19; general obstetrics; health disparities and vulnerable populations; mental health services; peripartum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38104,""
"Associations of Psychological Capital, Coping Style and Emotional Intelligence with Self-Rated Health Status of College Students in China During COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 lockdown can lead to mental health problem, and the problem is heterogeneous across individuals. In this study, we aimed to explore the association between the self-reported health status, emotional coping style, emotional intelligence and positive psychological state of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The questionnaires of Self-rated Health Measurement Scale (SRHMS), Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS), Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used for online survey. The study included 367 undergraduates. Undergraduate sex, sibling and birth of place were associated with either psychological capital scores or emotional intelligence. Online time per day had significantly negative associations with self-rated health and psychological capital scores. Multivariate analysis showed that the interaction between emotional intelligence, psychological capital and coping styles was statistically significant (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.112, p = 0.045) in health status with psychological capital ranking the top (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.428). Mediation analysis showed that psychological capital and coping style modified the effect of emotional intelligence on health status. Psychological capital and coping style modified the effect of emotional intelligence on health status in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Perception of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on dental researchers","Historical evidence shows a gender-based disproportionate effect of pandemics across different populations. In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began spreading its devastating effects worldwide. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on research productivity, work-life arrangements, and mental health of dental professionals worldwide with focus on gender differences. A 38-item survey, concerning demographics, career stage, employer support, family structure, mental health, and relationships, was distributed to 7692 active members of the International Association for Dental Research. Bivariate associations between independent variables and the primary outcome variable were tested using Spearman's correlation test. A logistic regression model was used to assess the simultaneous, independent associations between each variable and researcher productivity. A total of 722 responses were obtained, indicating a 9.4% response rate. Higher productivity was reported by male respondents (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.021), and by those in senior career stages (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001). Institutional support was associated with higher productivity (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001). Lower productivity was reported by younger researchers (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003). Remote work negatively affected productivity (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001) and female respondents reported working more hours, regardless of work location (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004). Poor mental health was associated with low productivity (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001).

"Trajectories of parent and child well-being across the pandemic year: Role of financial strain, social distancing, and COVID-19 prevalence","Existing research demonstrated large deteriorations in parent, child, and family well-being within 2 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, little is known about the trajectories of families' adjustment in the following months, including what risk factors are associated with changes in families' adjustment. The current study examined (1) change in the parent, child, and family well-being over time; (2) associations of pandemic-related stressors, financial and social distancing-associated stress, with well-being between and within families; and (3) the role of local COVID-19 prevalence, prior participation in family-focused prevention, and parent gender. From April 2020 to January 2021, 393 parents from 235 families reported five times on parent mental health, child behavior problems, family relationships, and pandemic-related stressors. Findings indicate that, across all domains of well-being, there was either little change across the 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°months or a small degree of recovery followed by a shift to further deterioration. On average, parents experiencing greater pandemic-related stressors also reported poorer functioning in all domains; monthly fluctuations in pandemic-related stressors were also associated with fluctuations in parent mental health and child behavior problems. In some domains, the links between pandemic-related stressors and parent and child well-being were stronger among families living in areas with overall higher COVID-19 prevalence rates. Parents' experiences during the pandemic did not differ systematically across prior intervention participation or parent gender. Taken together, findings suggest a need for supportive interventions to help families navigate extended periods of crisis.

"Proteomics of fibrin amyloid microclots in long COVID/post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) shows many entrapped pro-inflammatory molecules that may also contribute to a failed fibrinolytic system","Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also now known as long COVID, has become a major global health and economic burden. Previously, we provided evidence that there is a significant insoluble fibrin amyloid microclot load in the circulation of individuals with long COVID, and that these microclots entrap a substantial number of inflammatory molecules, including those that might prevent clot breakdown. Scientifically, the most challenging aspect of this debilitating condition is that traditional pathology tests such as a serum CRP (C-reactive protein) may not show any significant abnormal inflammatory markers, albeit these tests measure only the soluble inflammatory molecules. Elevated, or abnormal soluble biomarkers such as IL-6, D-Dimer or fibrinogen indicate an increased risk for thrombosis or a host immune response in COVID-19. The absence of biomarkers in standard pathology tests, result in a significant amount of confusion for patients and clinicians, as patients are extremely sick or even bed-ridden but with no regular identifiable reason for their disease. Biomarkers that are currently available cannot detect the molecules present in the microclots we identified and are therefore unable to confirm their presence or the mechanisms that drive their formation. Here we analysed the protein content of double-digested microclots of 99 long COVID patients and 29 healthy controls. The patients suffering from long COVID reported their symptoms through a questionnaire completed by themselves or their attending physician. Our long COVID cohort's symptoms were found to be in line with global findings, where the most prevalent symptoms were constant fatigue (74%,) cognitive impairment (71%) and depression and anxiety (30%). Our most noteworthy findings were a reduced level of plasmaÃ‚Â Kallikrein compared to our controls, an increased level of platelet factor 4 (PF4) von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a marginally increased level of ÃŽÂ±-2 antiplasmin (ÃŽÂ±-2-AP). We also found a significant presence of antibodies entrapped inside these microclots. Our results confirm the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules that may also contribute to a failed fibrinolysis phenomenon, which could possibly explain why individuals with long COVID suffer from chronic fatigue, dyspnoea, or cognitive impairment. In addition, significant platelet hyperactivation was noted. Hyperactivation will result in the granular content of platelets being shed into the circulation, including PF4. Overall, our results provide further evidence of both a failed fibrinolytic system in long COVID/PASC and the entrapment of many proteins whose presence might otherwise go unrecorded. These findings might have significant implications for individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.","Kruger, Vlok, Turner, Venter, Laubscher, Kell, Pretorius","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-022-01623-4","20220921","Antibodies; Failed fibrinolysis; Kallikrein; Long COVID; Microclots; Platelet factor 4; Platelet hyperactivation; von Willebrand factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38112,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health status and care of adults with epilepsy in Germany","To mitigate the potential consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on public life, the German Federal Government and Ministry of Health enacted a strict lockdown protocol on March 16, 2020. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health status and the supply of medical care and medications for people with epilepsy (PWE) in Germany. The Epi2020 study was a large, multicenter study focused on different healthcare aspects of adults with epilepsy. In addition to clinical and demographic characteristics, patients were asked to answer a questionnaire on the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between March and May 2020. Furthermore, the population-based number of epilepsy-related admissions in Hessen was evaluated for the January-June periods of 2017-2020 to detect pandemic-related changes. During the first wave of the pandemic, 41.6% of PWE reported a negative impact on their mental health, while only a minority reported worsening of their seizure situation. Mental and physical health were significantly more negatively affected in women than men with epilepsy and in PWE without regular employment. Moreover, difficulties in ensuring the supply of sanitary products (25.8%) and antiseizure medications (ASMs; 19.9%) affected PWE during the first lockdown; no significant difference regarding these impacts between men and women or between people with and without employment was observed. The number of epilepsy-related admissions decreased significantly during the first wave. This analysis provides an overview of the general and medical care of epilepsy patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. PWE in our cohort frequently reported psychosocial distress during the first wave of the pandemic, with significant adverse effects on mental and physical health. Women and people without permanent jobs especially reported distress due to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the mental health burden and barriers to accessing medication and medical services, as self-reported by patients and verified in population-based data on hospital admissions.

"Internet-based cognitive therapy for women with antenatal depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: protocol for a multi-center randomized controlled trial across China","Depression and anxiety are common among pregnant women. Internet-delivered psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) have been developed to increase accessibility and address common help-seeking barriers, especially during pandemic period. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of iCBT on reducing depressive symptoms among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic with the overall goal of preventing depression recurrence in the first 12 months postpartum. A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted where 300 pregnant women early in their third trimester will be screened for depression symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during a routine obstetrical visit. Eligible and consenting women with a score greater than 9 will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either intervention group or control group. ICBT involving the completion of 7 weekly online modules will be delivered via a well-designed perinatal mental healthcare app. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of iCBT on reducing depression symptoms among pregnant Chinese women starting from their third trimester. The secondary objectives are to examine the effect of iCBT on anxiety, sleep quality, social support, parenting stress, co-parenting relationship, and infant development. This multi-center randomized controlled trial has been planned in accordance with best practices in behavioral trial design. The internet-based intervention addressed the needs of pregnant women during a major pandemic where face-to-face therapy is not preferable. The trial has a relatively large sample size with sufficient power to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT intervention for the primary and secondary outcomes. One year follow-up evaluation in the study is designed to determine the longer-term effect of the intervention on both maternal and infant outcomes. Although a limitation is the assessment of depression and anxiety using self-report measures, these easily incorporated and maternal-preferred assessments allow for real-life scalability if the intervention is proven to be effective. Ethics was approved by the institutional review board of International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital (GKLW2020-25). Dissemination of results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and presented at scientific conferences. The first patient was enrolled on 19 August 2020. To date, 203 participants have met eligibility requirements and been randomized to either the intervention group or control group. Data collection aims to be complete in September 2022.

"Veterans' ambulatory care experience during COVID-19: veterans' access to and satisfaction with primary care early in the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread changes to healthcare, but few studies focus on ambulatory care during the early phase of the pandemic. We characterize veterans' ambulatory care experience, specifically access and satisfaction, early in the pandemic. We employed a semi-structured telephone interview to capture quantitative and qualitative data from patients scheduled with a primary care provider between March 1 - June 30, 2020. Forty veterans were randomly identified at a single large urban Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical center. The interview guide utilized 56 closed and open-ended questions to characterize veterans' perceptions of access to and satisfaction with their primary care experience at VHA and non-VHA primary care sources. We also explored the context of veterans' daily lives during the pandemic. We analyzed quantitative data using descriptive statistics and verbatim quotes using a matrix analysis. Veterans reported completing more appointments (mean 2.6 (SD 2.2)) than scheduled (mean 2.3 (SD 2.2)) mostly due to same-day or urgent visits, with a shift to telephone (mean 2.1 (SD 2.2)) and video (mean 1.5 (SD 0.6)). Among those who reported decreased access to care early in the pandemic (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27 (67%)), 15 (56%) cited administrative barriers (""The phone would hang up on me"") and 9 (33%) reported a lack of provider availability (""They are not reaching out like they used to""). While most veterans (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31 (78%)) were highly satisfied with their VHA care (mean score 8.6 (SD 2.0 on a 0-10 scale), 9 (23%) reported a decrease in satisfaction since the pandemic. The six (15%) veterans who utilized non-VHA providers during the period of interest reported, on average, higher satisfaction ratings (mean 9.5 (SD 1.2)). Many veterans reported psychosocial effects such as the worsening of mental health (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6 (15%)), anxiety concerning the virus (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12 (30%)), and social isolation (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8 (20%), ""I stay inside and away from people""). While the number of encounters reported suggest adequate access and satisfaction, the comments regarding barriers to care suggest that enhanced approaches may be warranted to improve and sustain veteran perceptions of adequate access to and satisfaction with primary care during times of crisis.","Thomas, Thadani, Chen, Christie, Kern, Rajan, Kadiyala, Helmer","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-022-01851-3","20220921","Access; COVID-19; Pandemic; Primary care; Satisfaction; Veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38115,""
"Long COVID symptoms in a population-based sample of persons discharged home from hospital","The impact of long COVID among persons hospitalized and discharged home is unknown. We aimed to (1) report the prevalence of long COVID in persons hospitalized for COVID-19 and discharged home; (2) estimate the prevalence of physical, sensory, and psychological/mental health impairments; and (3) explore associated factors. We conducted a telephone survey of adult residents in Laval, Quebec, who were discharged home Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2 months post-hospitalization for COVID-19. Participants responded to a standard questionnaire regarding persistent symptoms. We calculated the prevalence of long COVID and of persistent types of symptoms and evaluated associated factors using bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. In our sample (n = 398), 70% reported physical symptoms, 58% psychological problems, and 16% sensory impairments. 31.5% reported being troubled by persistent symptoms (long COVID). Factors associated with long COVID were a greater number of symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.69-2.28) and increased hospital stay (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.06). Other factors associated with physical and psychological symptoms were female sex (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.27-3.71 and OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.25-3.39; respectively), higher education level (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.20-3.68 and OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.44-4.14; respectively), and obesity (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.15-3.34 and OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.05-2.77; respectively). In this population-based study of persons hospitalized for COVID-19 and discharged home, nearly oneÃ‚Â third were troubled by symptoms for 2 months or more post-discharge. There was a high proportion with persistent physical and psychological/mental health symptoms. Further research will assess the specific needs of these patients to inform health policy makers on service requirements for these persons.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health in Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study in Italy","<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms in Italian medical students and to identify the associated factors. <b>Design and Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online survey was administered to second-sixth year medical students of the University of Torino, collecting data on the students' sociodemographics, COVID-19 exposure, anxiety, depression and stress symptoms. Three hierarchical regressions adjusted for age, gender and year of study were executed. <b>Results:</b> The sample size was 1359. The prevalence of anxiety, depression symptoms, moderate perceived stress and severe perceived stress was 47.8%, 52.1%, 56.2% and 28.4%, respectively. The factors associated with mental health symptoms were: being a woman, a family history of psychiatric disorders, living off-site, competitive/hostile climates and unsatisfying friendships among classmates, poor relationships with cohabitants, negative judgment of medical school choice, fear of COVID-19 infection, feelings of loneliness, distressing existential reflections, and a worsening psychological condition related to the pandemic. Being in the fourth or sixth year constituted a protective factor for depression symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Mental health in medical students was associated with both COVID-independent and COVID-related factors. Accessibility to effective interventions must be increased to counteract these changes.","Carletto, Lo Moro, Zuccaroli Lavista, Soro, Siliquini, Bert, Leombruni","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221127632","20220921","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; medical students; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38117,""
"Association of polygenic risk scores and hair cortisol with mental health trajectories during COVID lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global stressor with inter-individually differing influences on mental health trajectories. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) for psychiatric phenotypes are associated with individual mental health predispositions. Elevated hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and high PRSs are related to negative mental health outcomes. We analyzed whether PRSs and HCC are related to different mental health trajectories during the first COVID lockdown in Germany. Among 523 participants selected from the longitudinal resilience assessment study (LORA), we previously reported three subgroups (acute dysfunction, delayed dysfunction, resilient) based on weekly mental health (GHQ-28) assessment during COVID lockdown. DNA from blood was collected at the baseline of the original LORA study (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°364) and used to calculate the PRSs of 12 different psychopathological phenotypes. An explorative bifactor model with Schmid-Leiman transformation was calculated to extract a general genetic factor for psychiatric disorders. Hair samples were collected quarterly prior to the pandemic for determining HCC (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°192). Bivariate logistic regressions were performed to test the associations of HCC and the PRS factors with the reported trajectories. The bifactor model revealed 1 general factor and 4 sub-factors. Results indicate a significant association between increased values on the general risk factor and the allocation to the acute dysfunction class. The same was found for elevated HCC and the exploratorily tested sub-factor ""childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders"". Genetic risk and long-term cortisol secretion as a potential indicator of stress, indicated by PRSs and HCC, respectively, predicted different mental health trajectories. Results indicate a potential for future studies on risk prediction.","Ahrens, Neumann, von Werthern, Kranz, Kollmann, Mattes, Puhlmann, Weichert, Lutz, Basten, Fiebach, Wessa, Kalisch, Lieb, Chiocchetti, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Reif, Plichta","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02165-9","20220921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38118,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon self-reported physician burnout in Ontario, Canada: evidence from a repeated cross-sectional survey","To estimate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on levels of burnout among physicians in Ontario, Canada, and to understand physician perceptions of the contributors and solutions to burnout. Repeated cross-sectional survey. Active and retired physicians, residents and medical students in Canada's largest province were invited to participate in an online survey via an email newsletter. In the first survey wave (March 2020), 1400 members responded (representing 76.3% of those who could be confirmed to have received the survey and 3.1% of total membership). In the second wave (March 2021), 2638 responded (75.9% of confirmed survey recipients and 5.8% of membership). Level of burnout was assessed using a validated, single-item, self-defined burnout measure where options ranged from 1 (no symptoms of burnout) to 5 (completely burned out). The overall rate of high levels of burnout (self-reported levels 4-5) increased from 28.0% in 2020 (99% CI: 24.3% to 31.7%) to 34.7% in 2021 (99% CI: 31.8% to 37.7%), a 1-year increase of 6.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°percentage points (p&lt;0.01). After a full year of practising during the COVID-19 pandemic, respondents ranked 'patient expectations/patient accountability', 'reporting and administrative obligations' and 'practice environment' as the three factors that contributed most to burnout. Respondents ranked 'streamline and reduce required documentation/administrative work', 'provide fair compensation' and 'improve work-life balance' as the three most important solutions. During the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, prevalence of high levels of burnout had significantly increased. The contributors and solutions ranked highest by physicians were system-level or organisational in nature.","Gajjar, Pullen, Li, Weir, Wright","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060138","20220921","COVID-19; Health &amp; safety; Health policy; MENTAL HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38119,""
"How the Covid-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the issue of active mobility and co-benefits in Latin American cities","The Covid-19 pandemic has brought to the fore many issues that will impact public health for years to come -one such impact is on the nexus between transportation and health. Promoting safe, active transport is an activity that has many physical and mental health benefits. During lockdowns, many cities in Latin America imposed infrastructural and legislative changes in order to abide with public health and social mea-sures to reduce virus spread. These ranged from additional bike lanes to reduced speed limits or incentives to purchase bicycles. These cities showed reduced motorized transport, improved air quality and increased active transport, all of which have multiple health and equity benefits. As countries ""build back better"", promoting active transport offers the most value for investment and improves health and well-being while continuing to offer social distancing. Quantified case studies are needed to have a more comprehensive under-standing of the impact of active transport in various contexts.","Peden, Puvanachandra, Keller, Rodrigues, Quistberg, Jagnoor","https://doi.org/10.21149/12786","20220921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38120,""
"Effectiveness of online mindfulness-based interventions in improving mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Psychotherapies, such as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), are currently needed to tackle mental health problems. Online MBIs have become promising since face-to-face interventions are limited during the COVID-19 pandemic due to lockdown and social distancing. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of online MBIs in improving mental health, mainly depression, anxiety, and stress. A systematic literature search was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines on several databases for eligible studies up to October 17, 2021. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tool. Effect sizes were presented as standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) between the online MBIs and control groups at post-test and follow-up using a random-effects model. Eight randomized controlled trials involving 868 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled adherence rate to online MBIs was 94% (95% CI = 91% to 98%). The findings revealed that online MBIs had a statistically significant small to moderate effect in reducing depression (g = -0.32; 95% CI = -0.49 to -0.14; I2 = 0%), a small effect on anxiety (g = -0.25; 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.06; I2 = 27%), and a moderate effect on stress (g = -0.62; 95% CI = -1.09 to -0.16; I2 = 83%). In addition, significant small effects at follow-up were observed for depression (g = -0.26; 95% CI = -0.48 to -0.04; I2 = 0%) and anxiety (g = -0.28; 95% CI = -0.48 to -0.08; I2 = 0%), but not for stress. Online MBIs have beneficial effects on mental health, particularly depression, anxiety, and stress, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the limitations of the current study, future trials that specifically consider potential effect influencing factors, longer follow-up evaluation, and methodological quality are warranted.","Witarto, Visuddho, Witarto, Bestari, Sawitri, Melapi, Wungu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274177","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38121,""
"Perceived manageability of debt and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A UK population analysis","This study examined the association between perceived manageability of debt and risk of depression, anxiety, and mental health help-seeking among a nationally representative sample of adults living in the United Kingdom (UK). Data was derived from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study Wave 6 (August/September 2021) which examined the psychological, social, and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK adult population. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between different levels of perceived debt manageability (i.e., ""easily manageable"", ""some problems"", ""quite serious problems"", ""very serious problems"", ""cannot manage at all"") and mental health related outcomes. Almost a quarter of the sample (24%, n = 494) reported debt management problems, and debt manageability associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, and mental health help-seeking. After adjusting for demographic variables (e.g. income, receipt of benefits), logistic regression analysis demonstrated a dose-response association between increasing levels of debt manageability problems and mental health outcomes. Specifically, adjusted odds ratios for anxiety ranged from 2.28 ('some problems') to 11.18 ('very serious problems'), for depression ranged from 2.80 ('some problems') to 16.21 ('cannot manage at all'), and for mental health help-seeking ranged from 1.69 ('some problems') to 3.18 ('quite serious problems', 'very serious problems'). This study highlights that debt manageability problems represent a robust predictor of depression, anxiety, and mental-health help seeking.","Shevlin, Redican, Hyland, Butter, McBride, Hartman, Murphy, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Bentall","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274052","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38122,""
"Wellbeing and coping of UK nurses, midwives and allied health professionals during COVID-19-a cross-sectional study","Nurse, Midwives and Allied Health Professionals (AHPs), along with other health and social care colleagues are the backbone of healthcare services. They have played a key role in responding to the increased demands on healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper compares cross-sectional data on quality of working life, wellbeing, coping and burnout of nurses, midwives and AHPs in the United Kingdom (UK) at two time points during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous online repeated cross-sectional survey was conducted at two timepoints, Phase 1 (7th May 2020-3rd July 2020); Phase 2 (17th November 2020-1st February 2021). The survey consisted of the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, the Work-Related Quality of Life Scale, and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (Phase 2 only) to measure wellbeing, quality of working life and burnout. The Brief COPE scale and Strategies for Coping with Work and Family Stressors scale assessed coping strategies. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regressions examined the effects of coping strategies and demographic and work-related variables on wellbeing and quality of working life. A total of 1839 nurses, midwives and AHPs responded to the first or second survey, with a final sample of 1410 respondents -586 from Phase 1; 824 from Phase 2, (422 nurses, 192 midwives and 796 AHPs). Wellbeing and quality of working life scores were significantly lower in the Phase 2 sample compared to respondents in Phase 1 (p&lt;0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on psychological wellbeing and quality of working life which decreased while the use of negative coping and burnout of these healthcare professionals increased. Health services are now trying to respond to the needs of patients with COVID-19 variants while rebuilding services and tackling the backlog of normal care provision. This workforce would benefit from additional support/services to prevent further deterioration in mental health and wellbeing and optimise workforce retention.","Gillen, Neill, Mallett, Moriarty, Manthorpe, Schroder, Currie, McGrory, Nicholl, Ravalier, McFadden","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274036","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38123,""
"Associations among Postpartum Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stressors","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related stressors (eg, exposure, infection worry, self-quarantining) can result in heightened levels of distress and symptoms of postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using a cross-sectional descriptive design, we collected survey data from a convenience sample of 670 postpartum persons who gave birth to a newborn during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The presence of PTSD symptoms was measured using the 21-item Birth Memories And Recall Questionnaire (BirthMARQ) and defined as an affirmative rating for each item (score of 5 to 7 on a 1 to 7 agreement scale). Symptoms counts were computed for each of the 6 BirthMARQ domains, 2 symptom clusters (intrusive; mood and cognition alterations), and the total number of symptoms. Symptom counts were analyzed using descriptive statistics. We explored associations among COVID-19 experiences (self-quarantine behaviors, infection worry, exposure) and counts of PTSD symptoms using negative binomial regression models while controlling for postpartum depression screening scores, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, number of weeks postpartum, race, and marital status. Almost 99% of participants reported experiencing at least one of 21 PTSD symptoms (mean, 8.32; SD, 3.63). Exposure to COVID-19 was associated with a 34% greater risk for experiencing intrusive symptoms, specifically, symptoms of reliving the birthing experience as if it were happening now (47% greater risk). Worry surrounding COVID-19 infection was associated with a 26% increased risk for experiencing intrusive recall symptoms in which birth memories came up unexpectantly. COVID-19 quarantining behaviors were not significantly related to increasing PTSD symptoms. Many of the demographic variables included were associated with increasing PTSD symptoms. Screening perinatal persons for PTSD is critically important, especially during public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of comprehensive mental health screening, including specific screening for trauma and symptoms of PTSD, across health care settings can help improve delivery of quality, patient-centered care to postpartum persons.","Shuman, Morgan, Pareddy, Chiangong, Veliz, Peahl, Dalton","https://doi.org/10.1111/jmwh.13399","20220921","COVID-19; depression; post-traumatic stress; postpartum; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38124,""
"Preliminary Investigation of Shift, a Novel Smartphone App to Support Junior Doctors' Mental Health and Well-being: Examination of Symptom Progression, Usability, and Acceptability After 1 Month of Use","Shift is a novel smartphone app for providing a digital-first mental health resource to junior doctors. It contains psychoeducational material, cognitive behavioral modules, guided mediations, information on common work stressors, and a section on help-seeking options for psychological problems through workplace and private avenues. This study aimed to conduct a preliminary investigation of the use and potential effectiveness of Shift on depressive and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes) and work and social functioning, COVID-19 safety concerns, and help seeking (secondary outcomes). This study also sought feedback on whether Shift was seen as an acceptable tool. Junior doctors in New South Wales, Australia, were approached through promotional activities from the Ministry of Health, specialist medical colleges, and social media advertisements between June and August 2020. Consenting participants provided web-based baseline data, used the Shift app for 30 days, and were asked to complete a poststudy web-based questionnaire. Outcomes were analyzed under the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 222 female (n=156, 70.3%; mean age 29.2, SD 4.61 years) junior doctors provided full baseline data. Of these, 89.2% (198/222) downloaded the app, logged into the app approximately 6 times (mean 5.68, SD 7.51), completed 4 in-app activities (mean 3.77, SD 4.36), and spent a total of 1 hour on in-app activities (mean 52:23, SD 6:00:18) over 30 days. Postintervention and app use data were provided by 24.3% (54/222) of participants. Depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly decreased between the pre- and postassessment points as expected; however, physicians' COVID-19 safety concerns significantly increased. Work and social functioning, COVID-19 concerns for family and friends, and help seeking did not change significantly. There was no significant relationship between symptom changes and app use (number of log-ins, days between first and last log-in, and total activity time). Most poststudy completers (31/54, 57%) rated Shift highly or very highly. Despite high levels of nonresponse to the poststudy assessment and increases in COVID-19 safety concerns, junior doctors who used the app reported some improvements in depression and anxiety, which warrant further exploration in a robust manner.","Sanatkar, Counson, Mackinnon, Bartholomew, Glozier, Harvey","https://doi.org/10.2196/38497","20220922","depression; digital mental health; help seeking; junior doctors; mHealth apps; mobile health apps; mobile phone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38125,""
"Increased Self-Reported Mental Health Problems Among Asian-Americans During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Evidence from a Nationally Representative Database","To investigate changes in mental health outcomes among racial groups between 2019 and 2020. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the third through fourth quarters of 2019-2020 longitudinal data from the National Health Interview Survey.

Discrete-time hazard models stratified by race/ethnicity were conducted, with hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values reported. Of a total 10,415 individuals, 16.3 and 14.1% reported that they were diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder in 2019, respectively. In the multivariable model, only Asian-Americans experienced a significant increase in the probability of receiving a diagnosis of depression by 104% between 2019 and 2020 (HR 2.04, 95%CI 1.19-3.52; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.010).

An online survey consisting of close-set and open-ended questions aimed to describe the communication difficulties experienced in different communication activities (in-person and telecommunication) during the COVID-19 pandemic. 172 individuals with hearing loss and 130 who reported not having a hearing loss completed the study. They were recruited through social media, private audiology clinics, hospitals and monthly newsletters sent by the non-profit organisation ""Audition Quebec."" Face masks were the most problematic protective measure for communication in 75-90% of participants. For all in-person communication activities, participants with hearing loss reported significantly more impact on communication than participants with normal hearing. They also exhibited more activity limitations and negative emotions associated with communication difficulties. These results suggest that, in times of pandemic, individuals with hearing loss are more likely to exhibit communication breakdowns in their everyday activities. This may lead to social isolation and have a deleterious effect on their mental health.

"Effect of the first wave of COVID-19 on Poison Control Centre activities in 21 European countries: an EAPCCT initiative","Public health emergencies often affect Poison Control Centre (PCC) operations. We examined possible effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on call volume, call characteristics, and workload in European PCCs. All 65 individual European PCCs were requested to supply data on the number of calls and call characteristics (caller, age groups, reason and specific exposures) from March to June in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (Part 1). Number of calls with specific characteristics was normalised to all calls. Calls (N) and call characteristics (%) were compared between 2020 and 2018/2019 (average), within PCCs/countries and grouped. Correlation between call volume and COVID-19 cases per PCC/country was examined. All PCCs received a survey on workload (Part 2). Parts 1 and 2 were independent. For Part 1, 36 PCCs (21 countries) supplied 26 datasheets. PCCs in the UK and in France merged data and supplied one datasheet each with national data. Summed data showed an increase of 4.5% in call volume from 228.794 in 2018/2019 (average) to 239.170 in 2020 (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

For Part 2, 38 PCCs (24 countries) filled the survey on workload (number/length of shifts and time on PCC duties), which increased in 23/38 PCCs (61%), while 10/38 (26%) worked with fewer employees. Obtaining aggregated European PCC data proved challenging but showed an increase in overall call volume and workload during the first COVID-19 wave. Call characteristics changed including fewer calls from professionals and more calls on specific exposures. Within single PCCs/countries a variety of effects was observed.","Hondebrink, Zammit, HÃƒÂ¸gberg, Hermanns-Clausen, Lonati, Faber","https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2022.2113094","20220921","Poison Control Centres; Poisoning; SARS-CoV-2; public health; toxicology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38128,""
"Patents as a Driver of the Unprecedented Biomedical Response to COVID-19","The response by the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors to the COVID-19 pandemic has been historically unprecedented. Vaccines based in cutting-edge technologies, such as the mRNA platform, were invented, tested, and distributed to patients in less than a year. Yet politicians and activists argue that patents and other intellectual property (IP) have impeded the development and distribution of these vaccines. In explaining why this is profoundly mistaken, this essay first describes the medical and economic uncertainties inherent in the production of vaccines, especially those made in response to an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19. This makes clear the unprecedented achievement in the mass production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in less than 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It then describes the current manufacturing and licensing landscape, which was created on the basis of a market infrastructure built by reliable and effective patent rights. There is now a glut in the global supply of vaccine doses-and billions more doses are still being produced. The essay concludes by identifying the non-IP causes impeding global vaccine distribution, such as lack of infrastructure in the developing world, as well as regulatory restrictions and trade barriers. Those concerned with global vaccine equity should focus on policies to resolve these real-world problems.","Mossoff, Adalja","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221124819","20220922","COVID; WTO; mRNA; patent; patent waiver; vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38129,""

"POST-COVID SUICIDE: FORENSIC SCIENCE ANALYSIS","The aim: The article draws attention to the raise of suicide incidents after COVID-19 and proposes special knowledge to use in some forensic examinations for patients with COVID-19 and after as a measure of suicide preventing. Materials and methods: Scientific researches and comparative analyzes of criminal cases marked as a suicide were done based on statistics method. 415 suicide cases were fixed in Ukraine in 2020, and other persons' influence for suicide committing was revealed only in 61cases. In 2021, the tendency has increased, and only during the first four months (from January till April) there were 213 suicide cases. Conclusions: There are so many cases of suicide after COVID-19 caused by mental and neurological disorders due to the coronavirus effects on human brain and psyche, not only at hospitals but at home as well. The virus can disrupt nervous system work both directly and indirectly, activating the immune system excessively (the so-called cytokine storm). Complex forensic medical and psychological examination may be appointed to determine the mental state of persons after COVID-19. There are two ways to solve the problem with the help of special knowledge and forensic science. On the one hand, investigate person's predisposition for suicide after covid to prevent a suicide. On the other hand, if you had failed and the person committed a suicide use the information received to prevent other persons' suicides.","Latysh","https://doi.org/10.36740/WLek202208216","20220921"," SARS-CoV-2 ;  forensic examination;  forensic expert;  post-COVID state;  special knowledge","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38131,""
"Myocardial Work in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19: Relation to Biomarkers, COVID-19 Severity, and All-Cause Mortality","Background COVID-19 infection has been hypothesized to affect left ventricular function; however, the underlying mechanisms and the association to clinical outcome are not understood. The global work index (GWI) is a novel echocardiographic measure of systolic function that may offer insights on cardiac dysfunction in COVID-19. We hypothesized that GWI was associated with disease severity and all-cause death in patients with COVID-19. Methods and Results In a multicenter study of patients admitted with COVID-19 (n=305), 249 underwent pressure-strain loop analyses to quantify GWI at a median time of 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°days after admission. We examined the association of GWI to cardiac biomarkers (troponin and NT-proBNP [N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide]), disease severity (oxygen requirement and CRP [C-reactive protein]), and all-cause death. Patients with elevated troponin (n=71) exhibited significantly reduced GWI (1508 versus 1707Ã¢â‚¬â€°mmÃ¢â‚¬â€°Hg%; <i>P</i>=0.018). A curvilinear association to NT-proBNP was observed, with increasing NT-proBNP once GWI decreased below 1446Ã¢â‚¬â€°mmÃ¢â‚¬â€°Hg%. Moreover, GWI was significantly associated with a higher oxygen requirement (relative increase of 6% per 100-mmÃ¢â‚¬â€°Hg% decrease). No association was observed with CRP. Of the 249 patients, 37 died during follow-up (median, 58Ã¢â‚¬â€°days). In multivariable Cox regression, GWI was associated with all-cause death (hazard ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.15], per 100-mmÃ¢â‚¬â€°Hg% decrease), but did not increase C-statistics when added to clinical parameters. Conclusions In patients admitted with COVID-19, our findings indicate that NT-proBNP and troponin may be associated with lower GWI, whereas CRP is not. GWI was independently associated with all-cause death, but did not provide prognostic information beyond readily available clinical parameters.

"The Effect of Being Unemployed on Mental Health: The Spanish Case","The lack of work appeared to be linked to several symptoms related to poor mental health. Likewise, the reverse relationship, namely the influence of poor mental health on the risk of job loss, has also been analysed, i.e. distress could lead to a poorer work performance culminating in potential job loss. Thus, the bidirectional nature of the relationship between unemployment and mental health makes the accurate estimation of causal relationships a complex matter, leaving room for additional research on the subject. The aim of this research is to analyse the influence that unemployment could have on mental health taking into account the bidirectional nature that exists between both concepts. In order to tackle the causal effect of being unemployed on mental health, we present a biprobit model taking into account the presence of dummy endogenous regressors and we compare these results with those obtained from a standard univariate probit. Our identification strategy exploits geographical information on the unemployment rates as instrument. We use Spanish cross-sectional data from the 2006, 2011 and 2017 years. Based on the results, the paper concludes that unemployed persons in Spain could be subject to a 5.4% higher probability of suffering symptoms related to a common mental disorder (versus 11% obtained using a standard probit). The results obtained confirm a negative impact of unemployment situation on mental health. In other words, the probability of unemployed people suffering a mental disorder seems superior to that for individuals with a job. Moreover, the marginal effect obtained from a univariate probit model without the possibility of controlling the mental health selection effects, proves the existence of a problem of simultaneity that would have overestimated the effect of being unemployed on mental health. It is hoped that the conclusions obtained here prove useful in the implementation of specific mental health care provision aimed at unemployed people. In this context, the evidence obtained should result in the incorporation of health assistance as an essential part in response to the needs of this collective. These special needs of unemployed people should be contemplated not only from a health care provision but also as part of a broader system that incorporates the mental health care of unemployed persons as part of more general public health policies. Finally, these results suggest that mental health-related objectives should be considered when planning, implementing, and evaluating active labour market policies for the unemployed. The length and severity of the last recession, together with the risks associated with the global crisis resulting from COVID-19, reiterate the obvious concerns about the consequences of economic crises and unemployment on personal mental health. In this context, our study could be a step forward in the study of the causal relationships between unemployment and mental health when new data are available.","Escudero-Castillo, Mato Diaz, Rodriguez-Alvarez","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effect+of+Being+Unemployed+on+Mental+Health:+The+Spanish+Case.","20220921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38133,""
"'We stick people in a house and say okay, you're housed The problem is solved': A qualitative study of service provider and organisational leader perspectives on thriving following homelessness","Research aimed at identifying and evaluating approaches to homelessness has predominately focused on strategies for supporting tenancy sustainment. Fewer studies focus on strategies for enabling thriving following homelessness, and the perspectives of service providers and organisational leaders (SPOL) on this topic are rare. We conducted this study in the context of a community-based participatory research project in two cities in Ontario, Canada. This research was aimed at identifying the strengths and challenges of existing supports in enabling thriving following homelessness, followed by co-designing a novel intervention alongside persons with lived experience of homelessness (PWLEH) and SPOL. The current study presents the findings of interviews conducted in 2020-2021 with SPOL in organisations serving PWLEH. We interviewed 60 individuals including service providers (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°38; 63.3%) and organisational leaders (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°22; 36.7%) using semi-structured qualitative interviews. Interviews were conducted and recorded on Zoom to align with physical distancing protocols associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed abductively informed by the lenses of social justice and health equity. The essence of our findings is represented by a quote from a research participant: 'We stick people in a house and say okay, you're housed. The problem is solved'. This essence was expressed through five themes: (1) stuck in a system that prevents thriving, (2) substance use as an important coping strategy that prevents tenancy sustainment and thriving, (3) the critical importance of targeting community integration following homelessness, (4) incorporating peer expertise as imperative and (5) people need to be afforded options in selecting housing and services following homelessness. Our findings indicate that SPOL envision possibilities of thriving following homelessness yet are embedded within a system that often prevents them from supporting individuals who are leaving homelessness to do so. Research, practice and policy implications are discussed.","Marshall, Phillips, Holmes, Todd, Hill, Panter, Easton, Landry, Collins, Greening, O'Brien, Jastak, Ridge, Goldszmidt, Shanoff, Laliberte Rudman, Carlsson, Aryobi, Perez, Oudshoorn","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14035","20220921","community intervention; health and social care; housing and community care; mental health; preventing homelessness; service delivery and organisation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38134,""
"[Central Nervous System and Psychiatric Complications in Long Coronavirus Disease 2019]","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2)has prevailed worldwide since early 2020 and has caused the global coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)pandemic.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened a COVID-19 aftercare clinic in February 2021 in Okayama University Hospital, where we specifically consult PCC patients. While examining such patients, three Cs are essential: complexity, continuity, and collaboration. Neurological and psychiatric manifestations are particularly important from the wide range of PCC symptoms. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that PCC patients suffer from brain fog(32%), memory loss(27%), attention disorder(22%), dyssomnia(31%), anxiety(23%), and depression(12%). The pathophysiology and treatment strategies for these conditions are yet to be developed, and further research is required. We have corroborated that endocrinological impairments may underlie the onset and deterioration of PCC. Through our continuous consultation at the COVID-19 aftercare clinic, we intend to conduct research on the pathophysiology of and treatment strategies for PCC.","Hagiya, Otsuka","https://doi.org/10.11477/mf.1436204667","20220921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38135,""

Fourteen semistructured interviews with CPSs were conducted from August to November 2020. Data were analyzed by using thematic analysis. Helpful support from employers during the transition to telehealth included clear communication and access to training on telehealth technologies. Main barriers and facilitators were related to interpersonal relationships and logistical factors. CPSs reported that telehealth allowed them to continue to support the peers they serve but that the quality of interactions was not as good as with in-person services. Logistical challenges included inadequate equipment and Internet access. To support CPSs in delivering telehealth, employers can engage them in open and transparent communication about guidelines for service delivery, provide training and equipment, and allow them the flexibility to tailor service delivery modalities to the peers they serve.","Walker, Gonzalez, Howard, Nguyen, Tucker, Hayes, Johnson, Moore, Druss","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100662","20220921","Community mental health services; Coronavirus/COVID-19; certified peer specialists; peer support; qualitative; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38137,""

"Exploring indirect impacts of COVID-19 on local health systems from the perspectives of health workers and higher education stakeholders in the Philippines using a phenomenological approach","Our study aimed to explore the experiences of stakeholders from local government units, health facilities and higher education institutions on the delivery of non-COVID-19 health services after the initial wave of the pandemic. Twenty-nine public health workers, thirteen university staff, and four hospital administrators in the Philippines participated. Using a descriptive phenomenological approach, we analysed transcripts from six focus group discussions conducted online between March and June 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic made the routine health programs inaccessible due to hesitancy among patients to visit health facilities, a shift in public health priorities, and lack of students to augment the existing workforce.Public health workers reported stress and mental health exhaustion. Apart from fear of infection during service provision, public health workers and university staff experienced work overload, pressure to learn new technology, and webinar fatigue. Mental health problems have surfaced as health workers and young people have become more affected while support services remain insufficient.Public health workers have reported actions to maintain service delivery in the new normal such as use of telehealth and social media. However, issues on workforce wellbeing and digital equity posed adaptation challenges. Participants suggested partnership with higher education institutions as pivotal to position local health systems towards recovery. The rapid change in the service landscape highlights the importance of sustainable partnerships, effective workforce management, equitable digital innovations, and promoting mental wellbeing to preserve community, school, and occupational health and rebuild resilient local health systems in low-resourced areas.

"Psychological Well-Being and Coping Strategies among Pakistani Heads of Households during COVID-19 Pandemic: An Online Survey","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic can affect mental health. Heads of the household are at higher risk of this effect because of their financial and social responsibilities. This study aimed to assess the psychological well-being and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic among heads of households in Pakistan. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted an online survey in May 2020. A convenience sampling strategy was used to enroll the heads of the households from all regions of Pakistan. A validated English and Urdu version of the WHO-5 well-being scale was used to assess well-being. The prevalence of poor well-being and its associated factors among heads of the households was measured using logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> A total of 509 heads of households participated in the survey. About 35% of the participants were dependent on financial sources other than salary. The news was considered a source of fear as 70% assumed that avoiding such news may reduce the fear. The most common coping strategies used during lockdown were; spending quality time with family, eating healthy foods, adequate sleep and talking to friends on the phone. The prevalence of poor well-being was found to be 41% (95% CI: 36.62-45.51). Individuals with any chronic illness were at a higher risk of poor wellbeing adjusted odds ratio of 1.64 (95% CI: 1.04-2.59). Worriedness was also found to be associated with a higher risk of poor wellbeing adjusted OR 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06-1.19). Reading books showed a protective association with poor mental wellbeing adjusted OR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.42-0.98). <b>Conclusion:</b> There was a high prevalence of poor mental wellbeing among heads of households in Pakistan. Worriedness related to the pandemic and having chronic illness were significant predictors of poor psychological wellbeing. Actions are required in the form of targeted mass psychological support systems for the heads of the families to improve their mental health during the COVID-19 crises.","Rabbani, Khan, Lodhi, Arshad, Irum, Marwat","https://doi.org/10.47176/mjiri.36.49","20220922","COVID-19; Head of Household; Mental Health; Pakistan; Psychological; Well-Being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38141,""
"The backbone symptoms of depression: a network analysis after the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Macao","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted the working lives of Macau residents, possibly leading to mental health issues such as depression. The pandemic served as the context for this investigation of the network structure of depressive symptoms in a community sample. This study aimed to identify the backbone symptoms of depression and to propose an intervention target. This study recruited a convenience sample of 975 Macao residents between 20th August and 9th November 2020. In an electronic survey, depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Symptom relationships and centrality indices were identified using directed and undirected network estimation methods. The undirected network was constructed using the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC) model, and the directed network was constructed using the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG) method. The stability of the centrality indices was evaluated by a case-dropping bootstrap procedure. Wilcoxon signed rank tests of the centrality indices were used to assess whether the network structure was invariant between age and gender groups. Loss of energy, psychomotor problems, and guilt feelings were the symptoms with the highest centrality indices, indicating that these three symptoms were backbone symptoms of depression. The directed graph showed that loss of energy had the highest number of outward projections to other symptoms. The network structure remained stable after randomly dropping 50% of the study sample, and the network structure was invariant by age and gender groups. Loss of energy, psychomotor problems and guilt feelings constituted the three backbone symptoms during the pandemic. Based on centrality and relative influence, loss of energy could be targeted by increasing opportunities for physical activity.","Zhao, Bai, Cai, Sha, Zhang, Lei, Lok, Chow, Cheung, Su, Balbuena, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13840","20220922","COVID-19; Depression; Macao; Network analysis; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38142,""

The perceptions of nurses related to the hospital safety climate relate positively to their behavior in the workplace. An organization's safety culture determines the risk of patient care. Patankar and Sabin (2010) identified safety values, safety leadership, safety climate, and safety performance as important factors affecting the development and improvement of an organization's safety climate. Several papers in the literature have examined the characteristics (Lin et al., 2017), influencing factors (Wagner et al., 2020), outcomes (Arzahan et al., 2022), and improvement strategies (Lee et al., 2019) related to hospital safety climates. The occupational safety of medical staff and their compliance with safety regulations relate closely to patient safety and care outcomes (Hessels &amp; Larson, 2016). The most frequently used outcome indicators of hospital safety culture are mortality rate, length of stay, infection rates, and patient satisfaction. However, unsafe medical environments and work stress may hinder the compliance of medical staff with safety behaviors and affect the value they place on these behaviors. Furthermore, perceiving a working environment as ""unsafe"" induces physical and mental health problems and dissatisfaction, leading to work stress and causing occupational injuries, physical and mental health issues, increased turnover, and decreased work satisfaction (Arzahan et al., 2022; Kalteh et al., 2021). The working environment of nurses is highly complex and uncertain, and considered to be one of the most hazardous occupational settings. However, guaranteeing a safe and friendly working environment is the responsibility of every organization and also a basic employee right. The International Council of Nurses (International Council of Nurses, 2017) advocates that every nurse has the right to work in a healthy and safe environment that minimizes the risks of injury and illness. Therefore, patient health outcomes should not be the only focus when discussing hospital safety culture, and more attention should be paid to promoting a safe working environment for medical staff as well. In their study conducted in Taiwan, Lin et al. (2022) proposed that the safety climate of hospitals covers six dimensions. Three of these, including ""experience of clinical jobs hindering the use of personal protective equipment,"" ""perception of comfort using personal protective equipment,"" and ""easy usage of personal protective equipment"", have not been addressed in studies conducted elsewhere. These three dimensions, which all relate directly to work environment safety, earned relatively low mean scores from the nurses surveyed, with ""comfort in using personal protective equipment"" earning the lowest mean score of all. Although the safety of working environments in medical organizations includes many dimensions (International Council of Nurses, 2017), including biological (infection risk), chemical (chemotherapy drugs), ergonomic (improper design, lifting), physical (radiation, needle stick injuries), and psychological (workload, workplace violence), the accumulated evidence provides insights that administrators may use to further improve hospital safety environments. Lin et al. (2022)'s investigation of nursing management practices related to hazardous antineoplastic drugs found the availability of adequate and appropriate personal protective equipment to be essential to promoting a safe working environment. During the current coronavirus disease pandemic, the three Taiwan-specific dimensions related to personal protective equipment have great value in helping nurse administrators foster and assess the safety climate in their hospitals. In addition to showing that nurses use personal protective equipment for self-protection and the protection of clients, these dimensions also provide to nurse administrators specific directions for creating a safe working environment by providing to nurses adequate, comfortable, and easy-to-use personal protection equipment.

"A systematic review of the international evolution of online mental health strategies and recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic","The global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health (MH). As a response to the pandemic, international agencies and governmental institutions provided an initial response to the population's needs. As the pandemic evolved, the population circumstances changed, and some of these international agencies updated their strategies, recommendations, and guidelines for the populations. However, there is currently a lack of information on the attention given to response strategies by the different countries throughout the beginning of the pandemic. 1) To evaluate the evolution of online MH strategies and recommendations of selected countries to cope with the MH impact of COVID-19 from the early stages of the pandemic (15 April 2020) to the vaccination period (9 June 2021) and 2) to review and analyse the current structures of these online MH strategies and recommendations. An adaptation of the PRISMA guidelines to review online documents was developed with a questionnaire for MH strategies and recommendations assessment. The search was conducted on Google, including documents from April 2020 to June 2021. Basic statistics and Student's t test were used to assess the evolution of the documents, while a two-step cluster analysis was performed to assess the organisation and characteristics of the most recent documents. Statistically significant differences were found both in the number of symptoms and mental disorders and MH strategies and recommendations included in the initial documents and the updated versions generated after vaccines became available. The most recent versions are more complete in all cases. Regarding the forty-six total documents included in the review, the cluster analysis showed a broad distribution from wide-spectrum documents to documents focusing on a specific topic. Selected governments and related institutions have worked actively on updating their MH online documents, highlighting actions related to bereavement, telehealth and domestic violence. The study supports the use of the adaptation, including the tailor-made questionnaire, of the PRISMA protocol as a potential standard to conduct longitudinal assessments of online documents used to support MH strategies and recommendations.","Almeda, DÃƒÂ­az-MilanÃƒÂ©s, Guiterrez-Colosia, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Alonso","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04257-8","20220920","COVID-19; Longitudinal; Mental health; Recommendations; Strategies; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38145,""
"Midwives' and maternity support workers' perceptions of the impact of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic on respectful maternity care in a diverse region of the UK: a qualitative study","To explore midwives' and maternity support workers' perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternity services and understand factors influencing respectful maternity care. A qualitative study. Eleven semistructured interviews were conducted (on Zoom) and thematically analysed. Inductive themes were developed and compared with components of respectful maternity care. Maternity services in a diverse region of the United Kingdom. Midwives and maternity support workers who worked during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings offer insights into the experiences and challenges faced by midwives and maternity support workers during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (March 2020-2021). Three core themes were interpreted that impacted respectful maternity care: (1) communication of care, (2) clinical care and (3) support for families. 1. Midwives and maternity support workers felt changing guidance impaired communication of accurate information. However, women attending appointments alone encouraged safeguarding disclosures. 2. Maternity staffing pressures worsened and delayed care provision. The health service's COVID-19 response was thought to have discouraged women's engagement with maternity care. 3. Social support for women was reduced and overstretched staff struggled to fill this role. The continuity of carer model of midwifery facilitated supportive care. COVID-19 restrictions separated families and were considered detrimental to parents' mental health and newborn bonding. Overall, comparison of interview quotes to components of respectful maternity care showed challenges during the early COVID-19 pandemic in upholding each of the 10 rights afforded to women and newborns. Respectful maternity care was impacted through changes in communication, delivery of clinical care and restrictions on social support for women and their infants in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future guidance for pandemic scenarios must make careful consideration of women's and newborns' rights to respectful maternity care.","Jones, Thompson, Dunlop, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064731","20220922","mental health; neonatology; obstetrics; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38146,""

It has impacted mental health of all ages specifically children and adolescents. The aim of this review was to assess level of loneliness and mental health related impacts of COVID-19 among both; children and adolescents. For this literature review, two independent reviewers searched articles on Cochrane library, MEDLINE, Google Scholar and Science-direct. Both MeSH terms and free text terms were used forÃ‚Â search purposes between December 01, 2019 and December 30, 2021. A total of 14 studies met inclusion criteria and of these, 8 studies were related to mental health related impacts of COVID-19 pandemic whereas 6 studies involved both aspects i.e. loneliness and mental health among children and adolescents. One study was qualitative, one interventional, and remaining 12 were cross-sectional surveys. The findings of this review suggest an increase in level of loneliness and mental health related impacts during COVID-19 pandemic among children and adolescents.

"A Digital Peer Support Platform to Translate Web-Based Peer Support for Emerging Adult Mental Well-being: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Mental health issues among emerging adults (aged 19-25 years) on a global scale have underscored the need to address their widespread experiences of depression and anxiety. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging studies are being directed toward the development and deployment of digital peer emotional disclosure and support for the psychological well-being of emerging adults. However, it is important to explore the implementation and clinical effectiveness, as well as associated mechanisms of change, for optimal approaches in conducting digital peer support interventions for emerging adults' psychological well-being. We describe a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the implementation and clinical effectiveness of Acceset, a digital peer support intervention to address emerging adult mental well-being. The intervention has 2 components. First, the digital peer support training equips befrienders (ie, peers who provide support) to harness 4 components of psychological well-being-mattering, selfhood, compassion, and mindfulness-to provide effective peer support for seekers (ie, peers who seek support). Second, Acceset incorporates psychological well-being digital markers and harnesses community engagement to drive emotional disclosure among peers. A total of 100 participants (aged 19-25 years) from the National University of Singapore will be recruited and randomized into 2 arms. In arm 1 (n=50), the seekers will use Acceset with befrienders (n=30) as well as moderators (n=30) for 3 weeks. Arm 2 comprises a wait-listed control group (n=50). A questionnaire battery will be used to monitor seekers and befrienders at 4 time points. These include baseline (before the intervention), 3 weeks (end of the intervention), and 6 and 9 weeks (carryover effect measurement). Implementation outcomes of the intervention will involve evaluation of the training curriculum with respect to adoption and fidelity as well as user acceptability of the Acceset platform and its feasibility for broader deployment. Clinical outcomes will include mattering, selfhood, compassion, mindfulness, perceived social support, and psychological well-being scores. This protocol received National University of Singapore Institutional Ethics Review Board approval in October 2021. Recruitment will commence in January 2022. We expect data collection and analyses to be completed in June 2022. Preliminary findings are expected to be published in December 2022. The Cohen d index will be used for effect size estimation with a .05 (95% reliability) significance level and 80% power. This protocol considers a novel digital peer support intervention-Acceset-that incorporates components and digital markers of emerging adult mental well-being. Through the validation of the Acceset intervention, this study defines the parameters and conditions for digital peer support interventions for emerging adults.

In addition, the healthy sisters of patients with EDs are known to present specific psychological vulnerabilities. This study evaluates differences between the general population, patients with EDs, and their healthy sisters. A group of 233 participants (91 patients with EDs, 57 of their healthy sisters and 85 community women) was enrolled in an online survey on general and specific psychopathology 1Ã‚Â year after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey examined associations between posttraumatic symptoms and depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, and eating-related concerns. Clinically relevant scores for posttraumatic disorders were found in patients with EDs. Healthy sisters scored similarly to patients for avoidance. Regression analysis showed specific associations between interpersonal sensitivity and posttraumatic symptomatology in patients and healthy sisters, but not in community women. The psychological burden in patients with EDs is clinically relevant and linked to interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsiveness, and global symptom severity. Differences between patients, healthy sisters, and community women are discussed regarding vulnerability factors for EDs.

"The impact of restrictions on psychological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease on biological treatment during the coronavirus pandemic in Norway","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions have led to changes in the follow-up routine of patients in outpatient clinics at hospitals in Norway. The purpose of this study was to assess possible associations between psychological health and concerns regarding COVID-19 societal and hospital restrictions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease on biological therapy. Patients with IBD (Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years) undergoing biological treatment (TNF-alpha inhibitor, ustekinumab, vedolizumab) for IBD were recruited from an IBD outpatient clinic in Norway. Data were collected through self-report, including questions covering concerns regarding their disease, medical therapy, and follow-up during the pandemic, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire (GAD-7). Multiple logistic regression with backward conditional selection was fitted to examine associations between patients' depression and anxiety levels and their concerns about COVID-19 restrictions, controlled for sociodemographic and disease-related factors. Five-hundred and six patients were included in this study. General condition, self-isolation, employment status, fear of visiting the hospital, and changes to patients' appointments made by the hospital were independently associated with higher levels of depression. Female gender, experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolation, experiencing an increased risk of COVID-19 because of IBD, being afraid to visit the hospital because of COVID-19 restrictions, and having their appointment cancelled due to COVID-19 were independently associated with higher anxiety levels. Concerns about physical health and societal and hospital restrictions were associated with anxiety and depression in patients with IBD undergoing biological treatment. The findings will help facilitate healthcare services for patients with IBD in outpatient clinics and develop guidelines for follow-up.","Opheim, Moum, SmÃƒÂ¥stuen, Moum","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-022-03254-4","20220920","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Inflammatory bowel disease; Patient-reported outcome; Quality of health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38157,""
"Decreased Sensitivity of Rapid Antigen Test Is Associated with a Lower Viral Load of Omicron than Delta SARS-CoV-2 Variant","Large-scale screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection is an important tool for epidemic prevention and control. The appearance of new variants associated with specific mutations can call into question the effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) deployed massively at national and international levels. We compared the clinical and virological characteristics of individuals infected by Delta or Omicron variants to assess which factors were associated with a reduced performance of RDT. A commercially available RDT as well as the evaluation of the viral load (VL) and the detection of replicate intermediates (RIs) were carried out retrospectively on positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal specimens from health care workers of the PitiÃƒÂ©-SalpÃƒÂªtriÃƒÂ¨re Hospital infected by the Delta or Omicron variant between July 2021 and January 2022. Of the 205 samples analyzed (104 from individuals infected with Delta and 101 with Omicron), 176 were analyzed by RDT and 200 by RT-PCR for VL and RIs. The sensitivity of the TDR for Omicron was significantly lower than that observed for Delta (53.8% <i>versus</i> 74.7%, respectively, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Moreover, the Delta VL was significantly higher than that measured for Omicron (median Ct 21.2 <i>versus</i> 24.1, respectively, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and associated with the positivity of the RDT in multivariate analysis. We demonstrate a lower RDT sensitivity associated with a lower VL at the time of diagnosis on Omicron-infected individuals in comparison to those infected with the Delta variant. This RDT lower sensitivity should be taken into account in the large-scale screening strategy and in particular in case of strong suspicion of infection where testing should be repeated. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Previous reports have shown a variability in the diagnostic performance of RDTs. In the era of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the use of RDT, mutation associated with these variants could affect the test performance. We evaluate the sensitivity of the RDT Panbio COVID-19 Ag (Abbott) with two variants of concern (VOC), the Delta and Omicron variants. In order to investigate whether clinical characteristics or virological characteristics can affect this sensitivity, we collected clinical information and performed a specific RT-PCR that detected the RIs as a marker of the viral replication and viral cycle stage. Our results showed that Omicron was less detected than the Delta variant. A lower viral load of Omicron variant in comparison to Delta variant explained this decreased sensitivity, even if they are at the same stage of the disease and the viral cycle and should be taken into account with the use of RDT as diagnostic tool.","Cocherie, Bastide, Sakhi, Zafilaza, Flandre, Leducq, Jary, Burrel, Louet, Calvez, Marcelin, Marot","https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01922-22","20220920","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; antigen; diagnostics; viral load","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38158,""
"General Anxiety, Diabetes-Specific Anxiety, and Quality of Life in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes","The purpose of the study was to identify the differential associations between general anxiety, diabetes-specific anxiety, and diabetes-specific quality of life (QOL). A cross-sectional study was conducted of 146 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) ages 13 to 17 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing demographic characteristics, general anxiety, diabetes-specific anxiety, depressive symptoms, and diabetes-specific QOL. The final sample of 146 adolescents was mostly male, non-Hispanic White, mean age of 14.5 Ã‚Â± 1.27, having diabetes for more than 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year, and using insulin pumps. Higher diabetes-specific anxiety was associated with poorer general treatment-related QOL, but general anxiety was not. General anxiety, diabetes-specific anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with diabetes-specific treatment-related QOL, worry-specific QOL, and poorer communication-related QOL. There may be a differential impact of general anxiety and diabetes-specific anxiety in adolescents with T1DM. Diabetes-specific anxiety may be a more important factor in adolescents reporting poorer general treatment-related QOL, worry-related QOL, and communication-related QOL, while general anxiety and diabetes-specific anxiety appear to similarly impact poorer diabetes-specific treatment-related QOL. Diabetes-specific anxiety may be a more important component of QOL in adolescents. Targeted interventions may be required to effectively improve QOL.","Rechenberg, Koerner Ms","https://doi.org/10.1177/26350106221125689","20220920","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38159,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and youth with anorexia nervosa: A retrospective comparative cohort design","There is a growing body of literature suggesting the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) negatively impacts mental health in individuals self-reporting an eating disorder (ED); however, limited pediatric data is available about the impact COVID-19 has had on youth with EDs, specifically Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our study uses a cross-sectional design to explore differences in ED symptoms between adolescents diagnosed with AN during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a retrospective cohort of adolescents for whom these measures were previously collected, prior to the pandemic. We report cross-sectional data assessing differences between AN behaviors and cognitions during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a retrospective cohort (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°25 per cohort) assessed before the pandemic. Results suggest that individuals with a first-time diagnosis of AN during the pandemic had lower percent expected body weight, and more compulsive exercise behaviors. These data support existing pediatric findings in exercise and body weight differences in adolescents with AN before and during the pandemic. Findings may be helpful in informing considerations for providers treating ED patients amidst and after the pandemic. This manuscript compares a retrospective cohort of adolescents diagnosed with AN prior to the pandemic to a cohort of adolescents diagnosed with AN during the pandemic. Results report that adolescents diagnosed with AN during the pandemic have lower weights and increased compensatory exercise behavior compared to adolescents diagnosed with AN before the pandemic despite no difference in length of illness. Findings may be helpful in informing considerations for providers treating ED patients amidst and after the pandemic.","Datta, Van Wye, Citron, Matheson, Lock","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23817","20220920","COVID-19; adolescent; anorexia nervosa; exercise; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38160,""
"The relationship between health worry, work distress, and affective symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of hopelessness and helplessness","The COVID-19 pandemic presented both serious health threats and economic hardships, which were reflected in increased rates of mood and anxiety symptoms. We examined two separate distress domains, health worries and work distress, as predictors of mood and anxiety symptoms. Additionally, we considered whether these two domains might be uniquely associated with the development of dysfunctional beliefs, as a proposed mechanism to account for increased symptoms during the pandemic. Two separate models were considered to examine if associations remained stable through the first year of the pandemic. Participants (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2152) were a representative sample of Florida adults. They completed online surveys at three waves: Wave 1 (April-May 2020), Wave 2 (May-June 2020), and Wave 3 (December-February 2021). Participants completed measures of COVID-19 health worry and work distress, anxiety, and depression. They also reported their level of hopelessness and helplessness (indices of dysfunctional beliefs). In an early pandemic model (Wave 1-Wave 2), health worry directly and indirectly predicted anxiety and depression via dysfunctional beliefs. In contrast, work distress only indirectly predicted both outcomes. In a longer-term model (Wave 2-Wave 3), health worry had direct and indirect effects on downstream anxiety but not depression. Pandemic work distress had no effect on depression or dysfunctional beliefs; however, it was associated with less anxiety. Although health worry and work distress predicted later symptoms of anxiety and depression, they appeared to operate through different pathways. These findings provide guidance for the development of more effective interventions to reduce the impact of pandemics.","Broos, Llabre, Saab, Leite, Port, Timpano","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12391","20220920","COVID-19 pandemic; affective symptoms; health worry; helplessness; hopelessness; work distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38161,""
"Caregivers' Concerns About Assisted Living Residents' Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study","Family or friend caregivers' concerns about assisted living (AL) residents' mental health are reflective of poor resident and caregiver mental health. COVID-19-related visiting restrictions increased caregiver concerns, but research on these issues in AL is limited. Using web-based surveys with 673 caregivers of AL residents in Western Canada, we assessed the prevalence and correlates of moderate to severe caregiver concerns about residents' depressed mood, loneliness, and anxiety in the 3 months before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregiver concerns doubled after the start of the pandemic (resident depressed mood: 23%-50%, loneliness: 29%-62%, anxiety: 24%-47%). Generalized linear mixed models identified various modifiable risk factors for caregiver concerns (e.g., caregivers' perception that residents lacked access to counseling services or not feeling well informed about and involved in resident care). These modifiable factors can be targeted in efforts to prevent or mitigate caregiver concerns and resident mental health issues.","Hoben, Baumbusch, B Hogan, Gruneir, A Chamberlain, Corbett, E Griffith, McGrail, E Amuah, E Lane, J Maxwell","https://doi.org/10.1177/10748407221124159","20220922","COVID-19; anxiety; assisted living facilities; cross-sectional studies; depressive symptoms; family/friend caregivers; frail elderly; health surveys; loneliness; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38162,""
"Changes in Grandparental Childcare During the Pandemic and Mental Health: Evidence From England","Policies aiming at reducing rates of hospitalization and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) encouraged older people to reduce physical interactions. In England, until July 2021, provision of care for grandchildren was allowed only under very limited circumstances. Evidence also suggests that reduced face-to-face interactions took a toll on mental health during the pandemic. This study aims to investigate associations between changes in grandchild care provision during the first 8/9 months of the pandemic and grandparents' mental health. Using prepandemic data from Wave 9 (2018/2019) and the second COVID-19 substudy (November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we first describe changes in grandchild care provision during the pandemic to then investigate, using regression models, associations between changes in grandchild care provision and mental health (depression, quality of life, life satisfaction), while controlling for prepandemic levels of the outcome variables. About 10% of grandparents stopped looking after grandchildren altogether during the first 9 months of the pandemic, with 22% reporting an overall decrease in the amount of grandchild care provided. Compared to grandparents who mostly maintained unchanged their grandchild care provision, those who stopped altogether and those who mostly reduced the amount of grandchild care provided were more likely to report poorer mental health, even accounting for prepandemic health. While measures to limit physical contact and shield older people were necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, policymakers should acknowledge potential adverse consequences for mental health among grandparents who experienced changes in their roles as grandchild caregivers.","Di Gessa, Bordone, Arpino","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbac104","20220920","COVID-19; Depression; Grandparenting; Life satisfaction; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38163,""
"The associations of pandemic-related difficulties with depressive symptoms and psychological growth among American older adults: Social support as moderators","The COVID-19 pandemic brought social, health-related, and financial risks to older adults, yet their associations with depressive symptoms and posttraumatic growth (PTG) were not systematically examined. With 3504 respondents aged 60 and over from Health and Retirement Survey, this study found pandemic-related healthcare delay and financial hardship associated with elevated depressive symptoms and decreased PTG, whereas social disruption predicted greater PTG. When confronted with multidimensional difficulties, a higher level of social support buffered depressive symptoms and enhanced PTG following healthcare delay, while those from immediate family members carried the weighing of moderation. Additionally, the moderation effect varied between support types, as exclusive instrumental support engendered more depressive symptoms and squeezed PTG by stimulating a sense of incompetence for older adults. Inversely, receiving both instrumental and emotional support helped individuals of older age against financial-related depressive symptoms. These findings shed light on older adults' mental health promotion in a pandemic context.","Fu, Guo, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591053221124374","20220920","depressive symptoms; older adults; pandemic-related difficulties; posttraumatic growth; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","",38164,""
