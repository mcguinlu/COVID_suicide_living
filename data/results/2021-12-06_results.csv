"Post-traumatic Stress Risk among COVID-19 Survivors in Colombia","The study's objective was to establish the prevalence and variables associated with post-traumatic stress disorder risk (PTSD-R) in a sample of COVID-19 survivors in Santa Marta, Colombia. A cross-sectional study was designed with a non-probabilistic sample of adult COVID-19 survivors. Participants were demographically characterized and completed scales for depression risk, insomnia risk, and PTSD-R. Three hundred and thirty COVID-19 survivors between 18 and 89 years participated; 61.52% were women. The frequency of depression risk was 49.70%; insomnia risk, 60.61%; and PTSD-R, 13.33%. Depression risk (OR = 41.43, 95% CI 5.54 - 311.63), insomnia risk (OR = 5.25, 95% CI 1.77 - 18.71), low income (OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.38 - 8.67) and being married or free union (OR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.13 - 6.22) were associated with PTSD-R. In conclusion, two out of every fifteen COVID-19 survivors are in PTSD-R. Depression and insomnia risk are strongly associated with PTSD-R in COVID-19 survivors.","Adalberto Campo-Arias; John Carlos Pedrozo-Pupo; Edwin Herazo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.02.21267210","20211205","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23170,""

"Hopes and fears: emerging adults in mood and anxiety disorder treatment predict outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic","Active patients at The First Episode Mood and Anxiety Program (FEMAP) were asked to participate in a study monitoring their symptoms during early COVID-19 closures. Participants were asked to predict both possible positive and feared outcomes of the pandemic. Responses were analyzed with a descriptive qualitative approach using thematic analysis. Primary feared outcomes included death, prolonged pandemic impacts, and concerns about employment, mental health, and education. Prevalent positive predictions included a new perspective, improved relationships, personal growth, and environmental improvement. These findings suggest the complex relationship between fear and hope for young people in the early stages of the pandemic.

"Impact of Covid-19 on the education of children with disabilities in Malawi: reshaping parental engagement for the future","Covid-19 has led to unparalleled school closures and bought about extraordinary and unique challenges to ensuring continuity of learning for children across countries. This paper focuses on the educational experiences of children with disabilities in Malawi. Using a telephone survey, 99 parents/carers were interviewed about the impact of school closure on them and their child with disabilities. Parents reported as being overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the educational experiences of their child with disabilities, with a significant number reporting that they had no contact with the school or the teachers during closures. Children with disabilities were reported as spending very little time on formal learning activities. Nonetheless, parents were confident that their child with disabilities would return to school once these re-opened, as parents noted the loss of structure for their child's day and increased loneliness arising from lack of contact with their friends. As schools reopen, the mental health of children with disabilities, alongside their learning, will need to be a priority. Finally, parents highlighted the need for more active involvement in their child's schooling, so that they are able to support them better when they are at home.","Singal, N.; Mbukwa-Ngwira, J.; Taneja-Johansson, S.; Lynch, P.; Chatha, G.; Umar, E.","https://doi.org/10.1080/13603116.2021.1965804","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: International Journal of Inclusive Education;: 17, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23173,""
"The limits of the maker ideology: local makerspaces, experimental practices, and COVID-19","Using ethnographic methods to investigate the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic affected two Makerspaces, we discuss the limits of the of Maker movementâ€™s ideological foundations. Both spaces moved their activities online but differ in their engagement with Corona-specific projects: While the eLab Berlin decided to avoid any involvement due to legal and practical issues, the South London Makerspace produced face shields using 3D printing and laser cutting processes. Across these differences in engagement, our main argument is that the pandemic caused, in both cases, a shock of the real, for the Maker ideology: Individually, the spacesâ€™ members were shocked at what the pandemic meant for the limits of their practice. From a more macro perspective, there was a shock of the real for the entire movement as a whole as the pandemic revealed the limits of its claims;the idea that the Maker movement can develop fast creative ideas and physical prototypes, which can then be scaled-up in production and, therefore, restructure manufacturing processes on a societal level.

"Mental health symptoms and association with COVID-19 vaccination receipt and intention to vaccinate among adultsÂ =Â 18Â years, United States","Early studies suggest that adults with mental health conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19 infection, severe complications, and higher mortality, yet face barriers in accessing timely health services. Data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, a large, nationally representative survey fielded from March 17â€“29, 2021 (nÂ =Â 77,104) were analyzed to examine COVID-19 vaccination and intention among adults with mental health symptoms. Separate multivariable regression models were conducted to examine associations between symptoms of anxiety, depression, and anxiety or depression on vaccine receipt (= 1 dose) and intention to be vaccinated. Reasons for not being vaccinated were also assessed. Approximately 35% of adults had symptoms of anxiety or depression. This population was less likely to receive COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR)Â =Â 0.94, 95%CI: 0.91â€“0.98) but more likely to intend to get a vaccine (aPRÂ =Â 1.13, 95%CI: 1.08â€“1.19) than those without these conditions. Females with mental health symptoms were less likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccination but more likely to intend to get vaccinated, while there were fewer significant associations between mental health symptoms and vaccination coverage and intentions to vaccinate among males. Reasons for not getting vaccinated, including concerns about possible vaccine side effects, efficacy, cost, dislike of vaccines, as well as lack of trust in the government and vaccines, were all greater among those with any symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders than those without symptoms. Efforts are needed to increase vaccination uptake and confidence among this vulnerable population by increasing vaccine confidence and addressing concerns about the vaccine.","Nguyen, Kimberly H.; Chen, Stacy, Morris, Kathryn, Chui, Kenneth, Allen, Jennifer D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106905","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Preventive Medicine;: 106905, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23175,""
"Physical activity and COVID-19 The basis for an efficient intervention in times of COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shocked world health authorities generating a global health crisis. The present study aimed to analyze the different factors associated with physical activity that could have an impact in the COVID-19, providing a practical recommendation based on actual scientific knowledge. We conducted a consensus critical review using primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature regarding physical activity and physical activity related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main online database used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. COVID-19 has negatively influenced motor behavior, levels of regular exercise practice, eating and nutritional patterns, and the psychological status of citizens. These factors feed into each other, worsening COVID-19 symptoms, the risk of death from SARS-CoV-2, and the symptoms and effectiveness of the vaccine. The characteristics and symptoms related with the actual COVID-19 pandemic made the physical activity interventions a valuable prevention and treatment factor. Physical activity improves body composition, the cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and mental health of patients and enhancing antibody responses in vaccination.","Clemente-SuÃ¡rez, Vicente Javier, BeltrÃ¡n-Velasco, Ana Isabel, Ramos-Campo, Domingo JesÃºs, Mielgo-Ayuso, Juan, Nikolaidis, Pantelis A.; Belando, Noelia, Tornero-Aguilera, Jose Francisco","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.113667","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Physiology & Behavior;: 113667, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23176,""

"Mental distress of parents with chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: A prospective cohort study","Objective To-date there has been limited examination of the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in parents who suffer from chronic physical conditions. We aimed to 1) examine whether presence of a chronic disease predicts differential latent distress profile memberships, and 2) assess factors that could predict different distress profiles in the sub-group of parents with a chronic disease. Methods We used a sample of 1618 parents, from the longitudinal COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Study, who completed a measure of mental distress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale) at 13 data collection points. Distress profiles were assessed with the latent profile analysis. Results We identified four distinct mental distress profile memberships, with the most common membership characterised by very low (48.1%), followed by low (31.9%), moderate (15.7%), and high (4.3%) distress scores. A higher proportion of parents with chronic diseases belonged to profiles experiencing low (34.7% vs. 30.4%), moderate (18.7% vs. 14.1%), and high (5.5% vs. 3.7%) compared to very low (41.2% vs. 51.8%) distress levels than other parents. Residing in Victoria, younger age, lower levels of social support and appraisal of COVID as risk were associated with membership to higher compared to very low distress profiles. Conclusion Our findings highlight the importance of considering chronic disease co-morbidity as an additive risk factor in addressing mental health outcomes of parents during pandemic-like events, since parents with chronic conditions are more vulnerable to experiencing worse mental distress. Future interventions should focus on ways to strengthen social support and provide guidance for managing threat appraisal.","Bik-Multanowska, Kinga, Mikocka-Walus, Antonina, Fernando, Julian, Westrupp, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110688","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychosomatic Research;: 110688, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23178,""

In this study, a comparison of air quality data of three cities was conducted with the help of fuzzy logic algorithm. It used to evaluating Indices through fuzzy multi criteria decision making (MCDM) framework in which linguistic terms of experts opinion and perception, accordingly computing matrix is constructed for sub criteria. There are five linguistic terms used in this framework to create membership functions such as high significant, significant, average significant, low significant and not significant. The three cities, Bangalore, Mysore, and Hubli-Dharwad air quality datas was taken for analysis and evaluating indices during pre-COVID years (2017, 2018, and 2019). The AQI value shows that Bangalore has the highest pollution level while Mysore has the lowest. Using the fuzzy theory, results show that Bangalore and Hubli-Dharwad decrease in pollution level by -0.074921% and -0.04797%. Negative sign shows the decrease pollution level while Mysore increase pollution level by 0.011792%. Overall the results show that AQI of Mysore city is low compared to Bangalore and Hubli-Dharwad.

"Implementing Essential Coaching for Every Mother during the COVID-19 pandemic: A pre-post intervention study","The primary objective of this project was to evaluate the preliminary impact of Essential Coaching for Every Mother on maternal self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety, and postpartum depression. The secondary objective was to explore the acceptability of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective pre-post study was conducted with first-time mothers in Nova Scotia, Canada, between July 15 and September 19, 2020. Participants completed a self-report survey at enrollment (after birth) and 6Ã‚Â weeks postpartum. Various standardized measures were used, and qualitative feedback on the program was also collected. Paired t tests were carried out to determine changes from baseline to follow-up on psychosocial outcomes, and qualitative feedback was analyzed through thematic analysis. A total of 88 women enrolled. Maternal self-efficacy increased between baseline (B) and follow-up (F) (B: 33.33; F: 37.11, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.000), whereas anxiety (STAI) declined (B: 38.49; F: 34.79, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004). In terms of acceptability, 89% of participants felt that the number of messages was just right, 84.5% felt the messages contained all the information they needed relative to caring for a newborn, and 98.8% indicated they would recommend this program to other new mothers. Essential Coaching for Every Mother may play a role in increasing maternal self-efficacy and decreasing anxiety, although future work with a control group is needed to delineate the true effects of the program.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate time until death among admitted patients. In total, all cases had resolved leading to 207 deaths. Length of stay was significantly longer in those who died as compared to those who did not (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007). Of patients who had been discharged, 54 were readmitted and nine subsequently died. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that in addition to older age, male sex, and a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes, that a history of premorbid depression was a risk factors for COVID-19 mortality (aHRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.42 [1.38-4.23] PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002), and that this association remained after adjusting for age and for neuropsychiatric conditions as well as medical comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and pulmonary conditions. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that associations between mortality and depression was strongest in males (aHRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.45 [2.04-9.72], PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and that the association between heart failure and mortality was strongest in participants agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°65Ã‚Â years old (aHRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30.50 [9.17-101.48], PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic? A longitudinal study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians' work experiences and employability","The COVID-19 pandemic places an enormous demand on physicians around the world. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians' work experiences and their ability and willingness to continue working in their profession until retirement (ie, their employability). A longitudinal comparative design was used. Survey data were collected on three moments: before (May 2019), in the early phase (May 2020) and in a later phase (November 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Time effects were tested using repeated-measures analyses of variance and one-way analyses of variance. This study took place among physicians of two hospitals in a large city in the Netherlands. 165 hospital physicians with surgical, medical and other specialties participated in this study. Physicians' employability significantly increased from the time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the period during this pandemic. Employability differs among physicians with surgical, medical and other specialties. Furthermore, physicians experienced a lower emotional, physical and quantitative workload during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with before the pandemic. Moreover, physicians experienced the most stress from the impact of COVID-19 on their work in general and from combining work and private life. This study shows that physicians' employability and work experiences are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Work experiences vary for physicians with different specialties. These varieties stress the importance of attention for physicians' individual needs and challenges regarding working during the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility of continuing work in the aftermath of this crisis. Based on this, physicians can be offered tailor-made solutions. This is important to maintain a healthy and employable workforce, which is essential for a sustainable healthcare system.","Leeuwen, Taris, van Rensen, Knies, Lammers","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050962","20211204","COVID-19; human resource management; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23189,""
"The burden &amp; contributing factors of psychological distress across India during the COVID pandemic","The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly and engulfing the entire world, forcing people to stay home, muting the hustle and bustle of modern world with tide of fear for contracting disease and death. This brutal disease has infected millions of people worldwide, many lost their job, world economies have ravaged and many more uncountable consequences. To assess the psychological distress due to COVID-19 outbreak and to determine contributing factors towards psychological distress. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between 12th May to 20th June 2020 &amp; 1537 valid responses were received. Modified K10 scale was used to assess psychological distress. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine extent of relationship between the contributing factors and psychological distress scale by estimating the odds of having significant stress with PÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.05. A total of 1537 valid responses were obtained. The overall psychological distress score was 19.79Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â .75 which implies mild psychological distress. Analysis of degree of psychological distress revealed 815 (53.0%) with no psychological distress, 385 (25.0%) mild, 194 (12.6%) moderate and 143 respondents (9.3%) had severe degree of psychological distress.

"How do family supportive supervisors affect nurses' thriving: A research before and during COVID-19 pandemic","Nurses need psychological resources (supervisor support), as well as formal support from their organizations, which help them combat the demands from work and home and be more thrive at work. Family supportive supervisor behaviors have been demonstrated above and beyond general levels of supervisor support in reducing work-family conflict and improving well-being. In line with this, first aim is to examine the effects of Covid-19 pandemic on nurses' perceived family supportive supervisor behaviors, work-to-family conflict, psychological well-being, and thriving. Second aim is to test the effects of nurses' perceived family supportive supervisor behaviors on their thriving through work-to-family conflict and psychological well-being. This study was designed as cross-sectional and analytical. A total of 511 nurses from Nigeria and Turkey participated in the study. Parametric tests and Structural Equation Analysis were employed to analyze the data. During Covid-19 pandemic, the scores of nurses' perceived family supportive supervisor behaviors and thriving decreased while the scores of their work-to-family conflict increased significantly. Results confirmed the negative effects of Covid-19 pandemic on nurses. Furthermore, results showed that family supportive supervisor behaviors had positive effect on thriving by decreasing work-to-family conflict and increasing psychological well-being. This study is one of the very first study examining the effects of family supportive supervisor behaviors on nurses' work-to-family conflict, psychological well-being and thriving. Results of this study indicate that nurses need family supportive supervisors to be more thrive at work. Therefore, formal family friendly policies and implications improving family supportive supervisor behaviors are recommended in organizations.","Ã…Å¾ahin, Adegbite, Tiryaki Ã…Å¾en","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.08.008","20211204","Covid-19 pandemic; Family supportive supervisor behaviors; Psychological well-being; Thriving; Work-to-family conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23193,""
"Links between Child Shyness and Indices of Internalizing Problems during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Protective Role of Positivity","Shyness in childhood has been linked to socio-emotional difficulties such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness. On the contrary, positivity (i.e., a personal tendency to see oneself, life, and future in a positive light) has been described as a protective factor. Given the challenges experienced by children during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., closure of school and confinement), we aimed to test the potential protective role of positivity and how it may link child shyness and indices of internalizing problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, loneliness) during the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°236 children (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 9.25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.20) from Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, the three worst-hit countries in Europe when the data were collected (April-June, 2020). Children completed online self-evaluation scales to assess temperamental shyness, positivity, and indices of internalizing problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from a multivariate regression analysis revealed significant interaction effects between shyness and positivity in the prediction of outcome variables. Follow-up simple slope analyses indicated that shyness was positively related to depression only among children with lower levels of positivity. The study highlights the role of children's positivity in buffering the pernicious link between shyness and their negative feelings during the pandemic. The practical implications of these findings are discussed.","Sette, ZuffianÃƒÂ², LÃƒÂ³pez-PÃƒÂ©rez, McCagh, Caprara, Coplan","https://doi.org/10.1080/00221325.2021.2011093","20211204","COVID-19 pandemic; Shyness; children; internalizing problems; positivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23194,""
"Premorbid traumatic stress and veteran responses to the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on lifestyle stability and physical and mental health. We examined the impact of preexisting posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and depression on biopsychosocial responses to the pandemic, including psychiatric symptoms, COVID-19 exposure, and housing/financial stability, among 101 U.S. military veterans enrolled in a longitudinal study of PTSD, a population of particular interest given veterans' trauma histories and defense-readiness training. Participants (83.2% male, 79.2% White, M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 59.28 years) completed prepandemic, clinician-administered psychiatric diagnostic interviews and a phone-based assessment between May and September 2020 using a new measure, the Rapid Assessment of COVID-19-Related Experiences (RACE), which was used to assess pandemic responses and its effects on mental and physical health; COVID-19 diagnosis and testing were also extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariate regressions showed that, controlling for demographic characteristics, prepandemic PTSD, ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .332; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .003, and AUD symptoms, ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .228; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .028, were associated with increased pandemic-related PTSD symptoms. Prepandemic AUD was associated with increased substance use during the pandemic, ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .391; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, and higher rates of self-reported or medical record-based COVID-19 diagnosis, ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .264; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .019.

"Psychological distress of patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic: A cross-sectional study in a University Hospital","Previous studies have revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic can cause psychological distress such as depression and anxiety. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) might be more vulnerable to psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its impact could be different according to dialysis modality. The aim of this study was to investigate COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients and identify differences in concerns about COVID-19 between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This cross-sectional study included 148 dialysis patients at Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital from August 2020 to September 2020. These patients responded to a questionnaire covering mental health status and COVID-19 related concerns. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia were measured using a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, a 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and a 7-item Insomnia severity Index (ISI), respectively. Outcomes of HD and PD patients were compared by propensity score matching analysis. Dialysis patients reported psychological distress including symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. HD patients showed higher scores for depression (p = 0.018), anxiety(p = 0.005), stress(p&lt;0.001), and insomnia(p = 0.006) than the PD patients. After propensity score matching, HD was associated with depression(p = 0.0131), anxiety(p = 0.0143), and stress(p = 0.000415).

"The Nurse Leader's Role in Nurse Substance Use, Mental Health, and Suicide in a Peripandemic World","Nurses are known to be at an increased risk of death by suicide, and recent studies have found links between nurse suicide, substance use, mental health issues, and job problems. Because of stigma, inaccessibility of resources, and regulatory and legal issues, nurses are unlikely to seek help unless a crisis forces them into treatment. The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of nurse suicide, the psychological impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the strategic planning approach to identify the needs of nurses, and promising interventions and practices. Evidence-based strategies to intervene at the personal, institutional, and regulatory levels should be employed to reduce nurse suicide by focusing not only on suicide but also on treatment of substance and mental health issues, as well as a renewed focus on disciplinary procedures that may place nurses in immediate danger of death by suicide. Nurse leaders have a moral obligation to provide proactive, meaningful interventions to reduce the risk of death by suicide among nurses.","Choflet, Barnes, Zisook, Lee, Ayers, Koivula, Ye, Davidson","https://doi.org/10.1097/NAQ.0000000000000510","20211203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23197,""

"COVID-19 psychological impact, knowledge and perceptions of healthcare professionals in Greece: ÃŽâ€˜ nationwide cross-sectional study","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals is currently under research and prevalence of mental health symptoms across the world vary a lot. Moreover, knowledge and perceptions of healthcare professionals towards the new coronavirus is yet to be explored since very few data have been published to date. Thus, we decided to conduct a cross-sectional, web-based survey to measure the levels of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. The knowledge and perceptions of healthcare professionals towards the new coronavirus were also examined with a self-constructed questionnaire. Data were collected between April 19th and May 31st 2020. In total, 1484 professionals participated in the survey and 1064 completed it in full; 60.8% were females, 66.5% were physicians and 24.3% were first-line healthcare workers. The prevalence of at least moderate symptoms was 13% for depression, 11.9% for anxiety, and 11.3% for stress. Women, younger participants, residents in urban areas, having lower income and worse self-reported health status had higher scores in all outcomes. First-line healthcare workers also indicated higher anxiety scores compared to those who were not first responders. Regarding knowledge and perceptions, most participants agreed with the asymptomatic nature of the virus and its heightened danger for older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Different views were expressed regarding the possibility of airborne transmission, its similarity to common flu, and the statements that the new coronavirus is manufactured and serves a specific purpose and that it is out of control.

The purpose of the present study is to record and detect possible signs of emotional burden on the psychological profile of northern Greek medical students in the second wave of the European pandemic at the hitherto culmination point. 342 medical students completed a questionnaire investigating some very rough and easily self-reported affective psychiatric symptoms and their responses were statistically evaluated. The results disclosed experienced emotional burden among medical students with a general exacerbation of various non-specific affective symptoms, but a decrease in suicidal ideation and auto-destructiveness was nevertheless observed. On the contrary, a moderate increase in wishes for illness was noted among medical students. Findings of emotional burden were disclosed among medical students with a general worsening of various non-specific affective symptoms in turn connoting feelings of discomfort in adapting to the multiple constraints and fear of insecurity for the newly-formed reality created by the outbreak of the new coronavirus pandemic.","Karakasi, Sismanidou, Spourita, Dimtsis, Karakasi, Bakirtzis, Pavlidis","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2021.042","20211203","SARS-CoV-2; medicine; pandemic; students; occupational psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23200,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Greek population: Suicidal ideation during the first and second lockdown","More than a year has passed since World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, and during this period over 237 million cases and more than 4.8 million deaths have occurred worldwide due to COVID-19.1 This unprecedented pandemic not only has burdened health systems but it also constitutes a major stressful event both due to the threat of illness and death that it poses, and to the drastic impact on human relations, financial activity, access to health services, etc. Additional factors that may contribute to stress include the protection measures against COVID-19, social distancing, and mobility restrictions. The impact of the pandemic on suicidal behavior, especially on the Greek population, is of critical importance, due to the increase in suicidality during the recent financial crisis in the country.2 The impressive decline in the GDP during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic (-9% of GDP),3 unemployment, isolation, reduced social contacts, problems in accessing mental health services, and also the limitations in terms of psychological support may increase the risk of suicidal behavior.4 With a view to investigating the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an online questionnaire was developed in March 2020 by the Second Department of Psychiatry of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) and the Postgraduate Program ""Liaison Psychiatry: Integrated Care of Physical and Mental Health"" of NKUA. This questionnaire included items regarding demographic characteristics, physical and mental health data, and issues related to the pandemic and the imposed restriction measures, such as perceived changes in participants' biorhythms, habits, and relationships with their colleagues, friends, and family. In addition, participants were asked to complete psychometric scales with regard to anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, family functioning, anger and resilience. During the first national lockdown in Greece (April 7 to May 3) a total of 5,748 adults from the community participated in the survey by anonymously completing the aforementioned questionnaire on a secure website of NKUA. A considerable effort was devoted to make the sample as representative as possible and to include members of the community who do not usually participate in such surveys, as individuals of older age or individuals with health conditions. The 5.20% two-week prevalence of suicidal ideation found in our study is an intermediate rate with respect to the 2.4% one-month prevalence in 2008, the 6.7% in 2011 and the 2.6% prevalence in 2013.5 Among the respondents, 14.1% were potential cases of anxiety, while 26.5% of depression. Independent risk factors for suicidal ideation included anxiety, depression, impaired family functioning, being unmarried or divorced, having a mental health history, as well as a poor perceived quality of physical health. In contrast, higher resilience, positive feelings with regard to the lockdown measures, relationship with friends, and faith in a Supreme Being emerged as protective factors for suicidal ideation.6 Investigating the risk and protective factors for suicidal ideation is especially important during this difficult period of the pandemic. There was an additional significant finding in this study: individuals who completed the questionnaire during the last two weeks of the first lockdown reported statistically significantly higher suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety than those who completed it in the previous two weeks, while a similar finding was revealed in a study from USA.7 Therefore, we were looking forward to the results of our survey conducted during the second lockdown.8 From the 5,116 individuals who had fully completed our questionnaire with respect to suicidal ideation during the first lockdown, 811 fully completed it for the second time from November 22 to December 21, 2020. Suicidal ideation was not found significantly different compared to the first lockdown. Independent risk factors for suicidal ideation during the second lockdown were depression, anxiety, living with a person with frail health and vulnerable for COVID-19 and suicidal ideation during the first lockdown. It is noted that during the second lockdown the rates of potential depression cases remained unchanged, whereas anxiety rates increased. Greater accessibility to health services, state financial support and increased mobility might have contributed to the stability of suicidal ideation despite the greater severity of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aforementioned studies determined the prevalence of suicidal ideation and its association with various demographic, clinical, social, familial, and psychopathological factors in a cohort context at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the relevant literature being rather poor. We consider that the provision of such data is critical for the plans of health system in pandemic conditions, while this longitudinal study is in progress during the subsequent waves of the pandemic.","Gournellis, Efstathiou","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2021.041","20211203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23201,""
"The effectiveness of telehealth versus face-to face interventions for anxiety disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Worldwide, it is estimated that 264 million people meet the diagnostic criteria for anxiety conditions. Effective treatment regimens consist of cognitive and behavioural therapies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment delivery relied heavily on telemedicine technologies which enabled remote consultation with patients via phone or video platforms. We aim to identify, appraise and synthesise randomised controlled trials comparing telehealth to face-to-face delivery of care to individuals of any age or gender, diagnosed with anxiety disorders, and disorders with anxiety features. To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched three electronic databases, clinical trial registries and citing-cited references of included studies. A total of five small randomised controlled trials were includable; telehealth was conducted by video in three studies, and by telephone in two. The risk of bias for the 5 studies was low to moderate for most domains. Outcomes related to anxiety, depression symptom severity, obsessive-compulsive disorder, function, working alliance, and satisfaction were comparable between the two modes of delivery at each follow-up time point (immediately post-intervention, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months), with no significant differences reported (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). None of the trials reported on the costs of telehealth compared to face-to-face care. For effectively treating anxiety and related conditions, interventions delivered by telehealth appear to be as effective as the same therapy delivered in-person. However, further high-quality trials are warranted to determine the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of telehealth interventions for the management of a wider range of anxiety disorders and treatments.","Krzyzaniak, Greenwood, Scott, Peiris, Cardona, Clark, Glasziou","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X211053738","20211203","Telemedicine; anxiety; cognitive behavioural therapy; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23202,""
"COVID-19 pandemic related excessive electronic media exposure and mental health in Saudi Arabia","Due to the continued spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of novel mutated viral variants, families all over the world are experiencing wide-ranging stressors that threaten not only their financial well-being but also their physical and mental health. The present study assessed the association between excessive electronic media exposure of pandemic-related news and mental health of the residents of Ha'il Province, Saudi Arabia. The present study also assessed the prevalence of perceived stress, fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, and loneliness due to COVID-19-related restrictions in the same population. A total of 490 residents of Ha'il Province participated in a cross-sectional online survey during a two-month period (March to April 2021). A validated 38-item self-report survey was used to collect the data. Significant associations were reported between excessive electronic media exposure and the prevalence of perceived stress (Ãâ€¡2=140.56; p&lt;.001), generalized anxiety (Ãâ€¡2=74.55; p&lt;.001), depression (Ãâ€¡2=71.58; p&lt;.001), COVID-19-related fear (Ãâ€¡2=24.54; p&lt;.001), and loneliness (Ãâ€¡2=11.46; p&lt;.001). It was also found that participants without depressive symptoms were 0.28 times less likely to have been exposed to excessive electronic media exposure (AOR: 0.28; C.I. 0.16-0.48; p&lt;.001). Similarly, participants with no stress/mild stress were 0.32 times less likely to have been exposed to excessive electronic media exposure (AOR: 0.32; C.I. 0.19-0.52; p&lt;.001). The findings of the present study suggest an urgent need for educational resilience programs (online and in-person) for susceptible individuals (females, unemployed, urban residents, etc.). Such programs would help them to develop skills to cope with the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alnohair, Syed, Ahmed, Sharaf, Alshehri, Haque, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202111_27243","20211203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23203,""
"Analysis of the impact of antidepressants and other medications on COVID-19 infection risk in a chronic psychiatric in-patient cohort","During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with confirmed cases in New York State accounted for roughly 25% of total US cases, with psychiatric hospital in-patients at particularly high risk for COVID-19 infection. The beneficial effects of mental health medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), on the severity of COVID-19 disease outcomes have been documented. Protective effects against infection have also been suggested for these medications. We therefore tested the hypothesis that medication use modifies the risk of COVID-19 infection in a long-stay, chronic in-patient psychiatry setting, where the potential for exposure was likely uniform across the facility, and where these medications were routinely prescribed. This was a retrospective cohort study of an adult psychiatric facility operated by the New York State Office of Mental Health. Current medication information and COVID-19 status was collected from electronic medical records for 165 people who were in-patients during the period January to July 2020, and logistic regression was employed to model the main effects of medication use on COVID-19 infection. A significant protective association was observed between antidepressant use and COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR) = 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.70, adjusted P &lt; 0.05). Analysis of individual antidepressant classes showed that SSRI, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and the serotonin-2 antagonist reuptake inhibitor classes of antidepressants, drove this protective effect. Exploratory analyses of individual antidepressants demonstrated an association between lower risk of infection and fluoxetine use (P = 0.023), as well as trazodone use (P = 0.001). The novel finding of reduced COVID-19 infection risk for psychiatric in-patients taking antidepressants, suggests that antidepressants may be an important weapon in the continued fight against COVID-19 disease. This finding may become particularly salient for in-patient settings if vaccine-resistant strains of the virus appear.","Clelland, Ramiah, Steinberg, Clelland","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1053","20211203","Antidepressants; COVID-19; fluoxetine; psychiatric illness; trazodone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23204,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Suicide Rate Trends in the Tsunami-Disaster-Affected Area Following the Great East Japan Earthquake","<b/> <i>Background:</i> People who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) were expected to have additional levels of psychological burden resulting from the stressful conditions imposed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; consequently, suicide rates may increase. <i>Aim:</i> We aimed to carry out continuous monitoring of suicide rates in the affected area following the GEJE under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. <i>Method:</i> This descriptive study monitored the suicide rates of the coastal area of Miyagi Prefecture, where disaster-related mental health activities have been continuing following severe damage caused by the tsunami disaster. An exponential smoothing time-series analysis that converted suicide rates into a smooth trend was conducted. <i>Results:</i> Although the suicide rate in the affected area was higher than the national average in February 2020, it showed a declining trend during the COVID-19 pandemic, while showing an increase trend in the national and non-affected areas. <i>Limitations:</i> Uncertainty about the direct reasons for suicide and the short time-scale observation are the limitations of this study. <i>Conclusion:</i> Although the national suicide rate increased, this was not the case for the affected area. Our findings may provide important lessons for suicide prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, which needs careful regional monitoring of the state of suicide and of high-risk approaches such as disaster-related mental health activities.","Orui, Saeki, Kozakai, Harada, Hayashi","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000832","20211203","COVID-19; descriptive epidemiology; disaster; suicide; the Great East Japan Earthquake","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23205,""
"Psychological Distress Among Healthcare Professionals During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Low Resource Settings: A Cross-Sectional Study in Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic has been very destructive to and compromised the functioning of all nations' public health systems. In the absence of a vaccine, healthcare workers have been employed to relentlessly fight against COVID-19. The psychological status of healthcare workers during the pandemic in countries with limited resources, notably Bangladesh, remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological states of frontline and non-frontline Bangladeshi healthcare workers during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from May 5 to 31, 2020 with 203 respondents. Psychological states were measured with a self-reported numerical scale of fear, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The prevalence rates of fear, anxiety, and depression were 60.6, 71.9, and 55.2%, respectively. Compared to non-frontline workers, frontline workers reported higher rates of anxiety (79.0 vs. 67.2%) and depression (65.4 vs. 48.4%). Multivariate logistic regression models showed that working in a public institution, being employed for &lt;5 years, and being over-worked were risk factors for developing psychological distress. Our findings emphasize the need for timely psychological interventions to support the mental well-being of healthcare professionals in Bangladesh.","Hossain, Patwary, Sultana, Browning","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.701920","20211204","Asia; Global South; coronavirus; mental health; psychological impacts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23206,""
"Mental Health Problems Among School-Aged Children After School Reopening: A Cross-Sectional Study During the COVID-19 Post-pandemic in East China","<b>Background:</b> Most studies on mental health problems caused by COVID-19 crisis in children were limited to the period of home quarantine. It remained unclear what adverse impact of the psychosocial stressors caused by school reopening, as well as the transitions in daily activities and social interactions had on mental health in children. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 6400 students in primary schools were enrolled in a cross-sectional study conducted in East China, between June 26 and July 6, 2020, when schools reopened. Children's mental health status was assessed by the parent version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Ultimately, data on a total of 6017 children with completed information on mental health, psychosocial stressors, daily activities, and social interactions were eligible for analysis. The associations of mental health with psychosocial stressors, daily activities, and social interactions were determined by ordinal logistic regression models. Stratified analyses were conducted according to grade, gender, school level, area, and caregiver-child relationship to further observe the effects of stressors on mental status. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of borderline, moderately abnormal, and prominently abnormal scores were 7.16, 3.34, and 1.96% for total difficulties, and 13.83, 13.45, and 17.85% for prosocial behavior, respectively. Children with psychological stressors had a significantly higher risk of being in a worse category of mental health status, with the maximum adjusted OR of 7.90 (95% CI 3.33-18.75) in those definitely afraid of inadaptation to study and life styles. Time used in home work and computer games was positively related to mental health problems, while physical exercises and frequency of communication with others was negatively related. The effects of psychological stressors on total difficulties were more evident in middle-high grade students (OR = 7.52, 95% CI 4.16-8.61), boys (OR = 6.95, 95% CI 4.83-8.55), those who lived in Taizhou (OR = 7.62, 95% CI 4.72-8.61) and with poor caregiver-child relationship (OR = 7.79, 95% CI 2.26-8.65). <b>Conclusion:</b> Emotional and behavioral difficulties, especially less prosocial behavior, were prevalent in primary school children after schools reopened. The Chinese government, communities, schools, and families need to provide more effective support for students' transition back into the school building and address emotional and behavioral problems for children with difficulties.","Wang, Wang, Lin, Chen, Wang, Liang, Guo, Fu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.773134","20211204","COVID-19; children; mental health; psychological stressors; school reopening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23207,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts on the Mental Health of Professional Soccer: Comparison of Anxiety Between Genders","This study verifies associated factors with trait and state anxiety in professional soccer teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample was composed of 315 athletes, coaches, and physical trainers of professional soccer teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. From this amount, 214 were classified with trait anxiety, and 315 were classified with state anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). This study is an epidemiological and cross-sectional study. We applied an observational method, and we performed a remote measurement. The measurement was made via online questionnaires in male and female individuals working on soccer teams (soccer professionals or athletes) who could be affected by anxiety during social isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic. Each questionnaire was composed of sociodemographic questions, self-perceived performance, and STAI. The main results indicated a significant difference between female vs. male soccer professionals in state anxiety (54.97 Ã‚Â± 9.43 vs. 57.65 Ã‚Â± 9.48 index) and trait anxiety (54.21 Ã‚Â± 5.74 vs. 55.76 Ã‚Â± 6.41 index) with higher results in men. Sociodemographic variables impacted significant differences between female and male athletes and professionals of soccer clubs, and anxiety during the pandemic COVID-19 period impacted self-perceived performance analysis.

"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Increases Mental Wellbeing and Emotion Regulation During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Synchronous Online Intervention Study","The COVID-19 pandemic imposed extreme living conditions of social distancing, which triggered negative mental health problems and created challenges in seeking mental health support. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been found to enhance wellbeing and mental health by reducing stress and anxiety and improving emotion regulation. Preliminary evidence suggests that online, synchronous MBIs may produce beneficial effects similar to face-to-face programs. However, the effectiveness of such online-MBIs to support mental health in highly stressful times, such as a global pandemic, requires further study. To this end, we investigated the effect of an online 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on aspects of mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (<i>N</i>=92) who expressed interest in discounted online-MBSR programs were recruited for the study. The division into experimental and control groups was based on actual enrollment to the courses. Those who enrolled in a program were assigned to the experimental condition and those who decided not to enroll served as controls. Participants were assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention for levels of mindfulness, perceived stress, anxiety, emotion regulation, and intolerance of uncertainty. Differences between the groups were tested using the general linear mixed effects model (GLMM) and Individual Growth Curve Models (IGCM) in intent to treat analysis. The findings indicated that, relative to the control group, MBSR improved mindfulness abilities (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001), decreased anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001), and stress (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001) and increased emotion regulation (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001). These effects were found to persist 1 month after the end of the program, despite the increased governmental public-health restrictions due to COVID-19 at that time. The ability to tolerate uncertainty, a central characteristic of the pandemic, was not found to be affected by the program. A mediation analysis revealed that the effect of the intervention on mental health improvement was partially mediated by the improvement in emotion regulation. Overall, the findings provide positive evidence for the feasibility of an online-MBSR program to support the mental health of individuals from the general population through the mediation of emotion regulation in challenging times, such as a global pandemic.","Sanilevici, Reuveni, Lev-Ari, Golland, Levit-Binnun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.720965","20211204","COVID-19; MBSR; anxiety; emotion regulation; internet-based intervention; mindfulness; online; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23210,""
"Stress of COVID-19, Anxiety, Economic Insecurity, and Mental Health Literacy: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach","The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a global health threat attributed to negatively affecting the mental health and well-being of people globally.

"Mental Health in Children in the Context of COVID-19: Focus on Discharged Children","<b>Introduction:</b> To date, the mental health consequences of children hospitalized with COVID-19 remain unclear. We aimed to assess mental health status in children in the context of COVID-19, with a focus on discharged children. <b>Methods:</b> We recruited discharged children who recovered from COVID-19 and healthy controls between July and September 2020 in Wuhan Children's Hospital. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were assessed in these children using questionnaires. Univariable and multivariable logistic and linear regressions were conducted to identify risk factors. <b>Results:</b> Totally, there were 152 children (61 discharged children and 91 healthy controls) aged 7-18 years old in our study. An increasing trend in the prevalence of PTSD, anxiety, and depression was observed in the discharged children compared with healthy controls (PTSD: 8.20 vs. 2.20%, anxiety: 22.95 vs. 13.19%; depression: 47.54 vs. 32.97%). Discharged children tended to report more depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.39) and less sleep problems (ÃŽÂ² = -0.37). Discharged children who lived in nuclear families and had longer hospital stays were more likely to report depression [odds ratio (OR) = 3.68 and 1.14, respectively]. Anxiety symptoms and the severity of sleep problems of discharged children were positively associated with caregivers' depression and PTSD symptoms (OR = 21.88 and 31.09, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> In conclusion, PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms were common among recovered children 4 months after COVID-19 hospitalization.

Spearman correlation analysis was used to associate the PSQI with the DASS-21. The results showed that the use of hypnotic drugs was negatively correlated with DASS-21 (P&lt;0.05), while the rest were positively correlated. The results of the multivariate analysis of sleep disorders showed that depression, anxiety, and stress were related to sleep quality (P&lt;0.05), and there was no statistical difference in the other variables. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sleep quality and depression-anxiety-stress state of the frontline nurses performing nucleic acid testing were adversely affected. Sleep disturbance is a serious problem among nurses testing for the delta strain during the pandemic. Anxiety, stress, and depression are associated with sleep disorders. It is necessary to take corresponding measures and conduct crisis management interventions to improve sleep quality and mental health adjustment during public health emergencies.","Chen, Liu, Lei, Tong, Wang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S338495","20211204","COVID-19; depression-anxiety-stress; perform nucleic acid sample collection; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23215,""
"Lifestyle and mental health 1 year into COVID-19","In previous work, Giuntella et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 118:e2016632118, 2021), we documented large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use and mental health among young adults at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. This study explores the trends 1 year into COVID-19, as vaccines began to roll out, COVID-19 deaths declined, and social distancing measures eased in the United States. We combine biometric and survey data from multiple cohorts of college students spanning Spring 2019 through Spring 2021 (N = 1179). Our results show persistent impacts of the pandemic on physical activity and mental health. One year into the pandemic, daily steps averaged about 6300 per day compared to about 9800 per day prior to the pandemic, a 35% decline. Almost half of participants were at risk of clinical depression compared to a little over one-third prior to the pandemic, a 36% increase. The impacts on screen time, social interactions and sleep duration at the onset of COVID-19 largely dissipated over the course of the pandemic, though screen time remained significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. In contrast to the sharp changes in lifestyle and mental health documented as the pandemic emerged in March 2020, we do not find evidence of behavioral changes or improvements in mental well-being over the course of Spring 2021 as the pandemic eased.","Barbieri, Giuntella, Saccardo, Sadoff","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02702-4","20211203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23216,""
"Mental Health in Obstetric Patients and Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Psychiatric morbidity is the most common childbirth complication with 1 in 5 women experiencing a perinatal mood or anxiety disorder. The cost of this psychiatric morbidity is pervasive, contributing to devastating maternal health, child developmental, and economic consequences. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and associated changes to perinatal experiences, resulted in profound psychological reactions including increased anxiety, depression, stress disorders, and sleep disturbance, further impacting obstetric patients. Providers' mental health has been challenged by moral injury and shared trauma. This article reviews mental health outcomes in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic for obstetric patients and their providers.","Raiff, D'Antonio, Mai, Monk","https://doi.org/10.1097/GRF.0000000000000668","20211203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23217,""
"The Role of Educators in Supporting the Mental Wellbeing of Postgraduate Pharmacist Distance Learners","Front-line healthcare professionals have experienced rapid changes to workload and pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in anxiety, depression and mental health stressors. For working professionals engaged in pharmacy postgraduate distance learning, access to educators was seen as a means to relay some of these stories and offload the stress caused by these unprecedented circumstances. The postgraduate pharmacy education team at De Montfort University felt a moral responsibility to provide extra support and extended their roles towards offering greater wellbeing support. In this commentary we detail the emergence of this new role and offer insights into how this was fashioned and its significance for catering to the mental health needs of pharmacists. This role has largely gone undetected and research is needed into the acceptability and feasibility of such a model and its plausibility and sustainability in the long term.","Hassam, Gulzar, Latif","https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8847","20211203","clinical pharmacy; covid-19; mental health; student support; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23218,""
"Promoting resilience in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic with a brief online intervention","The psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers has been impacted by the high levels of stress many have experienced during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a brief online course focused on introducing evidence-based skills that could increase resilience and decreases emotional distress in healthcare workers during the pandemic. Employees of a large healthcare system completed a mental health survey at baseline, and then one month and two months after some employees participated in an online resilience-enhancement course consisting of three 12-19Ã‚Â min videos focused on mindfulness, mentalization, and self-compassion. A total of 554 participants completed the baseline survey, endorsing moderate to high levels of emotional distress. Of those who completed all three assessments and participated in the course (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 38), significant improvements in resilience and reductions in emotional distress were found one and two months later, in comparison to those who did not participate in the course (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 110). These findings suggest that a brief, online intervention can improve the mental health of healthcare workers during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","DeTore, Sylvia, Park, Burke, Levison, Shannon, Choi, Jain, Coman, Herman, Perlis, Fava, Holt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.11.011","20211203","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Pandemic; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23219,""
"Changes in psychosocial functioning among urban, school-age children during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is concern about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial functioning among school-age children, who have faced unusual stressors during this time. Our goal was to assess mental health symptoms and social risks during COVID-19, compared to before the pandemic, for urban, racial and ethnic minority school-age children, and investigate the relationship between mental health and social risks. We conducted a cohort study from September 2019 until January 2021 of children age 5-11Ã‚Â years old recruited from an urban safety net hospital-based pediatric primary care practice. We measured emotional and behavioral symptoms (including attention, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms) before and during the pandemic with the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17). We measured social risks (including food and housing insecurity) before and during the pandemic with the THRIVE screener. We measured additional mid-pandemic COVID-related stressors with items on school participation, screens/media use, illness exposure, and caregiver mental health. We compared pre- and mid-pandemic PSC-17 symptom scores across 4 domains (total, attention, internalizing, and externalizing) and used path analysis to examine the relationship between mental health and social risks pre- and mid-pandemic. Caregivers of 168 children (54% non-Hispanic Black, 29% Hispanic, and 22% non-English speaking) completed the study. Children had significantly higher levels of emotional and behavioral symptoms midpandemic- vs. pre-pandemic in all domains. Significantly more children had a positive PSC-17 total score (18% vs. 8%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and internalizing (depression and anxiety) score (18% vs. 5%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) during the pandemic vs. before, indicating clinical concerns in these areas. Caregivers reported significantly more social risks during vs. before the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Mental health symptoms significantly correlated with number of social risks before the pandemic, but not during the pandemic. Less school assignment completion, increased screen time, and caregiver depression were all significantly associated with worse mid-pandemic mental health in children. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in depression/anxiety problems and social risks among urban, racial and ethnic minority school-age children compared to before the pandemic. More research is needed to understand if these changes will persist.","Spencer, Oblath, Dayal, Loubeau, Lejeune, Sikov, Savage, Posse, Jain, Zolli, Baul, Ladino, Ji, Kabrt, Mousad, Rabin, Murphy, Garg","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00419-w","20211203","Anxiety; COVID-19; Child psychiatry; Depression; Minority health; Social determinants of health; Urban health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23220,""
"Long-lasting consequences of Coronavirus disease 19 pneumonia: a systematic review","Coronavirus Disease 19 (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have plenty of data about the clinical features of the disease's acute phase, while little is known about the long-term consequences on survivors. We aimed to review systematically emerging evidence about clinical and functional consequences of Covid-19 pneumonia months after hospital discharge. Current evidence supports the idea that a high proportion of Covid-19 survivors complain of symptoms months after the acute illness phase, being fatigue and reduced tolerance to physical effort the most frequently reported symptom. The strongest association for these symptoms is with the female gender, while disease severity seems less relevant. Respiratory symptoms are associated with a decline in respiratory function and, conversely, seem to be more frequent in those who experienced a more severe acute pneumonia. Current evidence highlighted a persistent motor impairment which is, again, more prevalent among those survivors who experienced a more severe acute phase of the disease. Additionally, the persistence of symptoms is a primary determinant of mental health outcome, with anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress symptoms being commonly reported in Covid-19 survivors. Current literature highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to Coronavirus Disease 19 since the sequelae appear to involve different organs and systems. Given the pandemic outbreak's size, this is a critical public health issue: a better insight on this topic should inform clinical decisions about the modalities of follow-up for Covid-19 survivors.","Patrucco, Zeppegno, Baricich, Gramaglia, Balbo, Falaschi, Carriero, Cuneo, Pirisi, Bellan","https://doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4806.21.07594-7","20211203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","",23221,""
