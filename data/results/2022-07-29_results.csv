"Coaching for resilience in the workplace","The science asserts that resilience at work can be developed, with evidence pinpointing to multiple resources that can be built through deliberate coaching, training and interventions. The chapter explores individual and group coaching with SPARK Resilience, a model and a structured coaching protocol that have been administered in educational and workplace settings though face-to-face and digital means, showing positive impact on resilience, self-esteem and depression outcomes. This approach has been evolving in line with the latest research evidence and now includes most resilience-enhancing strategies identified in the literature. Lately, it has been tested during the COVID-19 pandemic and results have shown improved resilience and meaning, as well as a reduction in negative affect and stress.

"PPC in the workplace: The business case","Positive Psychology (PP) as the science of human flourishing, and coaching as a process or pathway towards human thriving, have an intimate relationship-working in tandem to provide the psychological nutrients to support wellbeing, engagement and development of workplace human capital. And, also to act as a preventive measure against ill-being, such as workplace stress, burn-out, depression, anxiety, workplace disengagement and general life dissatisfaction, together with their associated impact on the organisation's bottom line, i.e. profits. At the heart of human thriving in the workplace are three agreed-upon fundamental needs: connection, mastery and a sense of autonomy, with other needs such as novelty-variety, morality and beneficence offered as potential additions to the list of ""fundamentals"" (Vansteenkiste et al., 2020). The satisfaction of these needs for employee psychological health and wellbeing, as well as sustainable workplaces and communities through a focus on the ""triple bottom line"" (people, planet, profit;coined by Elkington, 1997) we, the authors, believe is the dual responsibility of both the organisation/workplace and the employee. This is also increasingly recognised by global and national organisations committed to improve occupational and workplace health and safety (ISO, 2021). This chapter examines arguments for both the utility and efficacy of PP and coaching jointly in the workplace referred to as Positive Psychology Coaching in the Workplace (PPCW) and how in combination they might act as both a preventative force and source of support and growth within the workplace.

"COVID-19 as post-migration stress: Exploring the impact of a pandemic on Latinx transgender individuals in immigration detention","Transgender asylum-seeking individuals are often exposed to traumatic events in their country of origin, during the migratory journey, and post-migration. As a host country, the United States disproportionately targets Latinx migrants through persecutory anti-immigration, nativist laws, and xenophobia. Many Latinx transgender individuals with precarious immigration statuses must await decisions about their cases in immigration detention centers. Detention centers have been criticized for a host of health and physical safety threats, such as sexual assault by guards and other detainees, physical violence, and negligence resulting in death. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a substantial impact on the lives of Latinx transgender migrants in detention by amplifying pre-existing stressors. Among these challenges is the limited access to mental health care and psychological evaluations needed to treat and determine histories of trauma, depression, and acute stress in credible fear asylum cases. The resilience framework will be used to address shared trauma between Latinx transgender migrants in detention and clinicians in coping with COVID-19-related barriers to therapeutic services.

"COVID-19 and the injustice system: Reshaping clinical practice for children and families impacted by hyper-incarceration","This chapter explores the systemic and psychological manifestations of racial and medical trauma symptoms associated with COVID-19 and parental incarceration and lays the groundwork for the implementation of relational-cultural and attachment theory and practice within a clinical community-based setting to treat this population. The overwhelming prevalence of infection of COVID-19 in correctional facilities further heightens the collateral trauma responses of children grieving the loss of their loved ones due to hyper-incarceration. Trauma symptoms exhibited by children and adolescents generally follow a similar symptomatology: depression, anger, aggression, self-isolation, and self-harming behaviors. As with other vulnerable populations impacted by various forms of trauma, children of incarcerated parents will likewise benefit from mental health providers employing attachment theory-based interventions during the global pandemic. Clinicians working with children of incarcerated parents often experience secondary trauma, and in the time of the coronavirus pandemic, the term shared trauma is more aptly applied.

"The pandemic within the pandemic of 2020: A spiritual perspective","Recovery from the colliding impact of COVID-19 and the recent highlighting of police brutality may rely on discovering intrinsic meaning in these traumatic experiences. Individuals directly or indirectly affected by these two seismic events struggle to find meaning. Spiritual concepts and interpretation of experiences may broadly assist in the discovery of meaning and purpose. Although mental health experts lack consensus as to the definition of ""spirituality,"" this reflection introduces two spiritual concepts that may be used as a framework for the integration of spirituality within the therapeutic environment. Such an integrative approach can be useful in a treatment session to reduce psychological distress stemming from current and possible impending events and foster a sense of meaning in one's life.

"Dialectical behavior therapy and the COVID-19 pandemic: Building a life worth living in the face of an unrelenting crisis","The COVID-19 global pandemic has drastically altered the way in which the world operates and human beings interact. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the bodies, finances, minds, and souls of every individual in more ways than one. People all over the world are feeling the impact of the increase of these stressors, with the psychological impact being potentially as great as the physical. Prior to the onset of this global pandemic, suicide was already considered a major public health problem (World Health Organization, Suicide. Retrieved from https://www.who.int/newsroom/fact-sheets/detail/suicide, 2018). This chapter will offer a reflection on the experience of providing dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. An overview of DBT will be provided in order to highlight the impact of the pandemic on the provider, the patient, and implementation of the treatment itself.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relational world of the patient-clinician dyad: Obstacles and opportunities","No one has escaped the impact of the global pandemic of COVID-19. The threat of injury and death anticipated by its spread, coupled with institutions' and individuals' limited agency in halting its course, represents a traumatic experience of unparalleled proportions. Providing mental health services during this period has been both challenging and rewarding. Through a combination of personal reflection, application of clinical concepts, and case material, this chapter examines how the pandemic and the consequent exposure of health disparities affect the intersubjective sphere of the therapeutic relationship and how adaptations to the frame impact the holding environment for patients. Several case illustrations are provided to illustrate these effects upon the therapist, the client, and the quality of the connection between client and therapist.

"School social workers responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: Experiences in traditional, charter, and agency-based community school agency settings","As demonstrated during past historical events such as the September 11th terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina, school social workers play a vital role in serving their communities by supporting students and their families during times of crisis. School social workers also engage in social justice work and advocate for the needs of their clients. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on a plethora of systemic inequities and challenges that impact the lives of young people and their families, particularly as they relate to schools and education. During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools have relied on the expertise, leadership, and skills of social workers to address multiple issues such as access to technology, food insecurity, services for students with disabilities, mental health support, and crisis intervention. This chapter describes the experiences of three school social workers in different high school settings: a public school, a charter school, and a school-based non-profit program. Macro-, mezzo-, and micro-level factors will be examined as they relate to school-based interventions in response to a national health crisis. Recommendations for clinical interventions in different school organizational systems in a time of crisis will also be discussed.

"Considerations in working with veterans during COVID-19: When the battle is at home","US veterans are uniquely poised to manage a global crisis when it arrives on their doorstep. They are also uniquely triggered. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the resilience and stressors faced by combat veterans during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic based on the writer's clinical experience. Veterans' reservoirs of crisis response skills honed in the military have broad applications to managing COVID-19, from assessing and navigating logistics of the crisis to tolerating certain aspects of social isolation and long-term separation from loved ones. On the other hand, some veterans struggle with the helplessness of not being able to save loved ones, loss of identity as protectors, and a reactivation of posttraumatic stress symptoms including survivor's guilt and moral injuries. The impact of this shared trauma on the therapeutic alliance and self-disclosure between clients and clinician is also considered.

"Job loss and shared trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic: Helping clients and the impact on the clinician","With widespread business shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the US economy, along with economies around the world, has entered a recession. Unemployment numbers have surged, and millions of Americans have found themselves out of work amid the largest pandemic in a century;for these people, anxiety over their own health and that of their loved ones is compounded by financial worry and anxiety over their place in society or in their family. Under such circumstances, long-suppressed trauma often makes itself known, and many job seekers wrestle with paralyzing crises of confidence. This chapter looks at the particular difficulties of coaching unemployed clients to find jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and concomitant recession. It discusses ways in which sustained unemployment can beget feelings of confusion and helplessness, and suggests a multi-step method for restoring clients' sense of control, helping them communicate their strengths to potential employers and ultimately succeed in obtaining new employment while increasing their sense of agency and self-worth.

"Staying true to our core social work values during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the lives of individuals, families, and communities around the world. While we have survived numerous crises over centuries, this event called into question a desire for answers like never before. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged professionals from all disciplines to act. While epidemiologists researched and physicians treated, the philosophers and existentialists began to ponder mortality and search for answers. There were those who pontificated about politics and oppression. All the while hospital beds were filled to capacity, and cities around the world stood still;social workers were among a group of essential workers who also had to grapple with many challenges;some even called into question our profession's code of ethics. For many social workers, it was the first time having to confront issues related to social justice and their personal values and consider ethical issues from providing services through digital technology and a test of their competence during this tumultuous time. As social workers, this is part of our calling, our mission to serve, and our responsibility to be where our clients are at, both emotionally and physically. Yet, what about the risks? What about the fears? Could we still instill a sense of hope in the face of despair? This chapter examines our profession's six core values and their applicability at a nonprofit human service organization delivering mental health and supportive services throughout New York City during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and why it's needed now more than ever.

"Repurposed, reassigned, redeployed","In this warzone of the new coronavirus, nurses, doctors, and healthcare workers are being moved to units they are unfamiliar with. They are frightened and experiencing feelings of inadequacy and helplessness they haven't known since their early postgraduate days. My patient, an OR nurse of 30 years, is one of those reassigned from her place of comfort to the trenches of the intensive care unit (ICU). Her years of nursing expertise are sorely needed, but the need competes with her overwhelming feelings of deficiency. She feels held hostage by all she does not know about critical care nursing. This case study addresses the patient's move in therapy from paralysis to a position of resilience that enables her to recognize and use her skills to move forward and contribute in her own unique way.

"Shared trauma, shared resilience during a pandemic: Social work in the time of COVID-19","This contributed volume reflects on the collective wisdom and ongoing efforts of the social work profession that has been in the forefront of the global pandemic of COVID-19. The contributors are seasoned social work academics, practitioners, administrators, and researchers. Working on the frontlines with patients and families, these social workers have garnered experiences and insights, and also have developed innovative ways to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on the psychosocial well-being of their clients and themselves. The 36 reflections, experiences, and insights in this curated collection address the behavioral, mental health, socioeconomic, and other repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic that have impacted their client base, most of whom are vulnerable populations. This new book is an early and essential work on the impact of the pandemic on the social work field with useful practice wisdom for a broad audience. It can be assigned in masters-level social work practice and elective courses on trauma, as well as inform both neophyte and experienced practitioners.

"States of Emergency","We are wrestling with so many heavy dilemmas in our country and world right now, and ""lil' Rhody"" as people fondly refer to our lovely Ocean State, is not exempt. The children's mental health crisis is one that impacts us all. Between 2009 and 2019, the rate of Rhode Island students reporting feeling ""sad or hopeless"" for a 2-week period within the past year rose from 25% to almost 33%. And in 2019, 17% of middle schoolers and 13% of high schoolers ""seriously considered suicide"" within the past year (YRBS). In general, rates like these are disproportionally higher for those most at risk â€” people of color, LGBTQ, and those with disabilities. The inequality and injustice in our society is not only a barrier, but also a cause for those most at risk for physical and mental health issues, especially those of the BIPOC community. Much like lack of green spaces, housing, and adequate food options in marginalized communities, there are also fewer resources and many structural barriers to healthcare (including mental healthcare) for these children from communities of color.","Wolfe, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1002/cbl.30650","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Brown University Child and Adolescent Behavior Letter; 38(8):8-8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35252,""
"The role of advocacy in improving access to care for children with mental illness","Across the country, most professionals caring for children have likely seen an increase in mental illness. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was already a trend of increasing rates of depression and suicidal ideation in American youth (Mojtabai et al., 2016). Since then, the problem has only worsened, as the collective mental health needs of children have been rising rapidly. A combination of factors, from isolation related to school closure and social distancing, to the traumatic effects of losing a parent, have contributed to this dramatic rise in distress (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2021). The CDC reported that the proportion of mental health-related ED visits increased abruptly after the beginning of the pandemic, with increases of 24% among children aged 5â€“11 years and 31% among adolescents aged 12â€“17 years, compared with the same period in 2019 (Leeb et al., 2020). These changes have been widely publicized, and in response to this national crisis, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), and the Children's Hospital Association (CHA) jointly declared a national state of emergency in October 2021 and created a 10-point outline for meaningful change in the recognition, prevention, and treatment of childhood mental illness (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2021). In addition, the United States Surgeon General issued an advisory on protecting youth mental health in December 2021 (Department of Health and Human Services, 2021).","Sojka, Philip","https://doi.org/10.1002/cbl.30645","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Brown University Child and Adolescent Behavior Letter; 38(8):1-5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35253,""

"Cultivating sacred moments: Evaluating a pilot program to foster psychospiritual wellbeing","Sacred moments are characterized by the qualities of transcendence, boundlessness, ultimacy, deep interconnectedness, and spiritual emotions, experienced within a single period of time (Pargament et al, 2014). Originating from sanctification theory, such moments represent a specific spiritual resource with the potential to enhance psychospiritual wellbeing. Thus, a sacred moments wellbeing program was developed and evaluated. The six-week blended program offered a novel, accessible, and inclusive way of cultivating sacred moments in college students and helping them explore sacred qualities through didactic, experiential, and reflective exercises. A pretest-posttest design with random assignment to the treatment and waitlist control groups was used to examine the feasibility and initial efficacy of the sacred moments program. Participants reported high levels of treatment credibility at post-workshop and program satisfaction at post-treatment. The completion rate was high at 73%. Furthermore, the program demonstrated preliminary efficacy with respect to spiritual and growth outcomes. That is, participants reported significant gains in sacred perceptions, daily spiritual experiences, spiritual growth, and personal growth from baseline to post-treatment. Non-significant outcomes included life satisfaction, perceived stress, depression and anxiety symptoms, and meaning in life. Additionally, a series of two-way mixed ANOVAs yielded statistically significant interactions between group (treatment and waitlist) by time (baseline and post-treatment) on the aforementioned significant variables as hypothesized. Open-ended participant feedback supported the practical significance of these findings. However, most treatment gains were not maintained at one-month follow-up, possibly due to the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic during the course of the study. Implications regarding spiritually integrated wellbeing programs and the unique role of sacred moments are discussed, along with possible interpretations of the findings. Overall, sacred moments appear to be promising phenomena that can be harnessed to promote growth and a healthy spirituality.

"Depressive Symptoms among COVID-19 patients: A cross-sectional study in the field practice area of District Mental Health Programme Unit, Ganjam","Introduction: COVID-19 patients are at increased risk of mental illness. The holistic concept care needs constant monitoring of mental health issues among patients. The objectives were to find out the proportion of depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients under treatment and to determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms. Materials & methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 480 COVID-19 Patients selected through random sampling method and were telephomcally interviewed by using questionnaire (developed with reference to PHQ-9) about the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. Exploratory data analysis was used to measure and visualized epressive symptoms and factors associated with it. Results: Out of all 480 study participants, 180 (38%) reported minimal, 36 (8%) had mild symptoms, 72 (15%) had moderate, 24(5%) had moderately severe and 12(2%) had severe depressive symptoms based on the final score of the interview. The proportion of patients who reported presence of any depressive symptoms (minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe) was found to be 67.5%. Variables like "" Age"", ""Place of treatment"" &"" COVID-19- Clinical stage ""were significantly associated with depression.

"Clinical characteristics and quality of life of persistent symptoms of COVID-19 syndrome in Indonesia","Introduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) manifests in a broad clinical spectrum. COVID-19 survivors report various symptoms up to several months after being infected. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of persistent COVID-19 syndrome in Indonesia, the factors that influence the incidence, and the quality of life. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with an online questionnaire conducted in January 2021. Inclusion criteria were: adult Indonesian citizens who had recovered from COVID-19, and were confirmed negative by RT-PCR of nasal swabs or had undergone an isolation period for a minimum of 14 days. Data analysis was performed by the Chi-square test, followed by multivariate analysis with the backward likelihood ratio method. Results From a total of 385 respondents, 256 (66.5%) experienced persistent COVID-19 syndrome. The most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (29.4%), cough (15.5%), and muscle pain (11.2%). Of the five aspects of quality of life, the most commonly reported aspects were pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The risk of persistent COVID-19 syndrome was significantly higher in subjects with older age, comorbidities, higher clinical severity, previous treatment in hospital, presence of pneumonia, and those who had required oxygen therapy. In the multivariate analysis, the most influential factor for the incidence of persistent COVID-19 syndrome was pneumonia (aOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.29-4.11, p&lt;0.002). Conclusions The prevalence of the persistent COVID-19 syndrome in Indonesia was high, which affects the quality of life of COVID-19 survivors. Pneumonia was the main factor that influenced the incidence of persistent COVID-19 syndrome. Further research with a larger sample size and a longer study time is recommended to control COVID-19 and its impact on the health and quality of life of COVID-19 survivors.","Susanto, Agus Dwi, Isbaniah, Fathiyah, Pratomo, Irandi Putra, Antariksa, Budhi, Samoedro, Erlang, Taufik, Muhammad, Harinda, Fadlika, Nurwidya, Fariz","https://www.google.com/search?q=Clinical+characteristics+and+quality+of+life+of+persistent+symptoms+of+COVID-19+syndrome+in+Indonesia","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Germs; 12(2):158-168, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35257,""
"Wellness and help-seeking among college students: A phenomenological study","College students face a significant risk of mental health issues that influence their academic performance, persistence, and personal safety. The COVID-19 global pandemic has heightened mental health risks for college students due to social isolation and shifts from in-person to virtual learning models. In 2019 and the beginning of 2020, 75% of college students reported experiencing moderate to high stress levels, yet only 30.2% of students indicated they used mental health services (ACHA, 2020). Researchers have identified strategies to promote positive mental health among students (Baldwin et al., 2017;Conley et al., 2013;Mahfoutz et al., 2018;Rizer et al., 2016), yet have paid little attention to the experiences, thought processes, and factors that influence how or why students choose to utilize such strategies. This phenomenological study explored the essence of the lived experiences of college students who have experienced stressors during their time as students with the goal to understand how they chose to seek help and promote their wellness. Three research questions will guide this study: (1) How do college students describe the essence of their personal wellness? (2) How do college students describe the stressors they have experienced during their undergraduate years? and (3) What guides college students' decision-making about how they support their wellness on campus?Gergen's (1985) work on social constructionism, which encourages us to consider how we know and understand the world beyond commonly held assumptions, provides the key theoretical concepts that influence this study. Three streams further inform the study of research: (1) conceptualizations of wellness, (2) college student development, and (3) wellness support. The researcher conducted individual interviews with traditional undergraduates at an institution of higher education in the Northeastern United States. students also submitted artifacts with written explanations representing their experience of wellness in response to stress. The interviews were transcribed, and several rounds of coding were conducted to identify common elements of the students' experiences. The participants' stories, experiences, and motivation offer insight into how higher education practitioners might incorporate or promote wellness strategies in ways that align with students' needs and interests.

"Mental health service delivery for IPV victims during the COVID-19 pandemic: Technology as a path forward","This paper focuses on outlining factors to consider for mental health service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we aim to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the rapid shift in the use of technology-based programs within family violence crisis centers. First, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology with IPV populations. Specifically, we are interested in how teleservices (particularly telehealth) assist and hinder service delivery and survivor outcomes. Second, two reputable and longstanding violence-prevention organizations in the Greater Houston Area (Houston Area Women's Center [HAWC] and Montgomery County Women's Center [MCWC]) will be used to illustrate some of the benefits and advantages resulting from the abrupt shift to telehealthbased service delivery for IPV victims and survivors. This paper provides some preliminary insight to the advantages and disadvantages of the transition to telehealth services during a pandemic in violence prevention organization settings. Nonetheless, there is a great need for additional efficacy and effectiveness studies as this transition is new and the long-term effects are not wellknown.

"Vaccine Hesitancy Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights from a Focus Group Study in Croatia","Even though vaccination has been regarded as historically one of the most successful public health interventions, vaccine hesitancy still remains an important health issue. In order to explore this issue, the authors conducted four asynchronous online focus groups with the total of 40 Croatian citizens. Drawing on iterative thematic analysis, three emerging overarching reasons of vaccine hesitancy were determined: risk perception (cost-benefit ratio), belief in natural immunity and institutional distrust. In addition, three possible cross-cutting topics emerged: communication with healthcare workers, influence of media, social media and the Internet, and COVID-19 pandemic. A widespread dissatisfaction with healthcare workers is tentatively explained by proposing the concept of 'false autonomy' of patients when making vaccination decisions. As for the COVID-19 context, the participants often cited their awareness of the profit-driven healthcare system in conjunction with the development of COVID-19 vaccines. The authors conclude by framing the study results into the wider social context of individualistic consumerism, postmodern health beliefs and the characteristics of Croatian healthcare system, as well by calling for more in-depth studies of vaccine hesitancy.","Pavic, Å½eljko, Dremel, Anita, Pintaric, Ljiljana, Kovacevic, Emma, Lesinger, Gordana","https://www.google.com/search?q=Vaccine+Hesitancy+Amidst+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Insights+from+a+Focus+Group+Study+in+Croatia","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Italian Sociological Review; 12(2):523-544, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35260,""
"Improving care for survivors of gun violence","Survivors of gun violence have significant sequelae including mental health disorders that often go undiagnosed and untreated. Survivors of gun violence are at high risk for both re-injury with a firearm as well as interaction with the criminal justice system. These poor outcomes for survivors of gun violence contribute to the cycle of gun violence that plague communities across the United States. Learning from historical public health successes, survivors of gun violence are an important population for targeted secondary prevention efforts. Despite this, the mechanisms for these outcomes among survivors of gun violence are largely unknown and there is a dearth of research on effective prevention strategies. Combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, I sought to better describe the experience of recovery for survivors of gun violence, conduct a pilot study of a mental health intervention for post-traumatic stress symptoms, and describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on community violence in Connecticut (CT). In Aim 1, I used a qualitative research study design and a community-based participatory research approach to better understand how Black male gunshot wound survivors in the United States describe their experience of recovery and their perceptions of their mental, emotional and social health following the event. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 Black male gunshot wound survivors from New Haven, CT. This study identified five themes which define the psychological recovery after intentional injury from gun violence as well as describe the various strategies used by survivors of gun violence to cope with a disrupted sense of safety when returning to their communities. In the secondary analysis of the data, I found that participants described distrust for the police and an ecology of guns that confers symbolic, social and strategic meaning to owning a gun. These findings suggest that barriers to mental health treatment may be addressed through ""credible messengers"" who can develop relationships of trust with this high-risk population and that interventions to decrease gun violence should address the cultural value of a gun as well as focus on improving police relations with racial/ethnic minoritized communities.In Aim 2, I designed a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of completing a randomized controlled trial to test the Screening and Tool for Awareness and Relief of Trauma (START), a targeted mental health intervention developed for patients that come from communities of color with sustained and persistent trauma. I conducted the study at Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, CT through the YNHH Violence Intervention Program beginning in January 2020. For a variety of reasons but most notably due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, only 11 patients were enrolled in the study. With this small cohort, I was able to conclude that (1) Successful recruitment hinges on enrollment in the local hospital-based violence intervention program and the effectiveness of credible messengers in the organization;(2) The START techniques would be improved by additional audiovisual resources;(3) The novel survey to measure alienation is reliable and (4) Testing the START intervention may be most successful in a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design so that all centers in the study will receive the intervention. In Aim 3, I examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on community violence in the state of Connecticut (CT). Through the CT Hospital-based Violence Intervention Program Collaborative, I used the trauma registries from Yale New Haven Hospital, Bridgeport Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, and Hartford Hospital to collect data on all violence-related trauma presentations in the emergency room from January 1st, 2018 to January 1st, 2021. I compared the pattern of violence-related...

"Environmental experience design research spectrum for energy and human well-being","The COVID-19 outbreak has made us realize how important human experiences within built environments are to retain or enhance our physical and mental health and well-being. The environmental quality of physical spaces occupied by humans depends on personal judgments made through the spatial experiences that reflect their individual needs, desires, and expectations. Such spatial or environmental experiences influential in human activities and outcomes should be researched much further to sustain or improve the soundness of our society and economy under any circumstances of people's lives. The pandemic that first emerged in December 2019 had also been slowing down human activities over the following months. It unexpectedly contributed to reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions that lead to global warming. According to the International Energy Agency, buildings account for 40% of global operational energy use. Built environments need to be delivered in a way that helps reduce or eliminate energy consumption, which negatively affects climate change. The built environment encompasses a system of energy and environment being occupied by the masses. To accommodate diverse needs and demands of individuals and societies, it needs to be customized or personalized. In parallel to studies on technological advancement, human-centric environmental experiences should be researched much further to ensure the delivery of socially, economically, environmentally, and humanly sustainable built environments that can be applied to privileged and unprivileged families, communities, and nations that are sharing our common future. In view of the global economic prospect, as well as the authors' expertise, this chapter selected China and Bangladesh as case studies to begin considering the emerging notion of environmental experience design and the research spectrum that impacts on the energy outlook and human well-being within built environments.","Noguchi, Masa, Lan, Li, Chowdhury, Sajal, Yang, Wei","https://www.google.com/search?q=Environmental+experience+design+research+spectrum+for+energy+and+human+well-being","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Handbook of Energy and Environmental Security;: 207-229, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35262,""

The original article has been corrected.] Background: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, people have undermined their mental health. It has been reported that post-COVID conditions at a certain rate. However, information on the mental health of people with post-COVID conditions is limited. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between post-COVID conditions and mental health. Methods: Design of the present study was an International and collaborative cross-sectional study in Japan and Sweden from March 18 to June 15, 2021. The analyzed data included 763 adults who participated in online surveys in Japan and Sweden and submitted complete data. In addition to demographic data including terms related to COVID-19, psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress were measured by using the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results: Of the 135 COVID-19 survivors among the 763 total participants, 37.0% (n = 50/135) had COVID-19-related sequelae. First, the results of the Bonferroni-corrected Mann Whitney U test showed that the group infected SARS-CoV-2 with post-COVID conditions scored significantly higher than those without one and the non-infected group on all clinical symptom scales (P &lt;= .05). Next, there was a significant difference that incidence rates of clinical-significant psychiatric symptoms among each group from the results of the Chi-squared test (P &lt;= .001). Finally, the results of the multivariate logistic model revealed that the risk of having more severe clinical symptoms were 2.44-3.48 times higher among participants with post-COVID conditions. Conclusion: The results showed that approximately half had some physical symptoms after COVID-19 and that post-COVID conditions may lead to the onset of mental disorders.Trial registrationThe ethics committee of Chiba University approved this cross-sectional study (approval number: 4129).

While 96 percent of the 256 respondents agreed that taharah as a demand before reading the Quran creates a sense of serenity and tranquillity, as well as a calm soul. 96.2 percent of the 256 respondents thought that getting closer to God and silaturrahim with family or friends were among the most effective strategies for reducing mental pressure and managing a peaceful soul.","Masruri, Muhammad, Ismail, Faisal Husen, Kirin, Arwansyah, Ibrahim, Abdul Qahhar, Misbah, Muhammad","https://www.google.com/search?q=RECITING+THE+QURAN+AND+FRIENDSHIP+ONLINE+AS+A+METHOD+OF+POST-COVID-19+SOUL+AND+MENTAL+CARE","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies; 21(62):84-99, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35265,""
"When the ""Model Minority"" becomes the ""Perpetual Foreigner"": Racial discrimination against Asian Americans in retail","According to a report by Stop AAPI Hate (Yellow Horse et al., 2021), racial discrimination against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in businesses such as grocery stores, malls, and restaurants (30.1%) and most were in the forms of verbal harassment (63.7%) and shunning (16.5%). In other words, many Asian Americans experienced racial discrimination in retail environments during the pandemic. Yet, despite the negative experiences in retail, studies on the forms of racial discrimination Asian American consumers faced during the pandemic and in their everyday lives have been lacking. The purpose of this study is to close this gap and debunk the assumption that Asian Americans do not experience racial discrimination due to the ""model minority"" myth (Gee & Peck, 2018). Also, to highlight the experiences of Asian Americans to inform retailers about the consumer group that is increasing in numbers and buying power (Constante, 2018;Nielsen, 2020). Moreover, the researcher proposes and tests a theoretical framework that synthesizes the literature on attributional ambiguity theory, racial microaggressions, and consumer research on attribution, emotions, and behaviors. To answer research questions and test the theoretical model, one-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted, and 18 East Asian Americans participated in the interviews. Two overt racial discrimination themes emerged from the interviews: No Asians in here please, All you Asians... Seven racial microaggression themes were found: Less than, The perpetual foreigner, Carriers of the virus, Invisible, Not a target customer, Stereotyped customers, and All the same. Three attribution themes were detected: Employee's negative attitude towards Asian Americans, Lack of contact with Asian Americans, and Ambiguous. Moreover, emotional responses were mostly other-directed (e.g., frustrated, irritated, and angry). Lastly, four behavioral response themes were discovered: Negative OCR, Direct complaint, No repatronage, and No action taken against the employee or retailer. Theoretical implications and future research are discussed for researchers and practical implications are provided for retailers and retail employees in terms of retail management.

"How lesbians' differentiation levels and family and personal values affect coming out and depression","Coming out can be a difficult transition to the family system which can affect the lesbian's identification with the new sexuality as well as emotional level of depression. Previous research did not look at self-differentiation levels and if it is able to impact and predict an ease of coming out. In this study, a qualitative research design was created to measure self-differentiation levels of lesbians who came out after the age of 18 and what affects it has on depression. It also looked at how a family's level of differentiation can affect the lesbian's ease of and acceptance of her new identity in regards to family cohesion and family conflict. Values of conservatism and self-transcendence were also measured in identifying whether it affected the lesbian's coming out. The study consisted of 159 participants who identified as lesbian and came out after the age of 18 between the ages of 18-65 years old. To gauge these variables, the participants were asked to complete an online survey consisting of surveys: Differentiation of Self Inventory-Short Form, Brief Family Relationship Scale, A Lesbian Identity Disclosure Assessment II, Beck's Depression Inventory-II, and Short Schwartz's Value Survey. The data has shown that both high family conflict and high family cohesion indicated higher levels of depression upon coming out. In the study, it was seen that self-differentiation did not show any significance and was not related to the ease of the coming out process among participants. In regards to the values, conservatism was not statistically significant but was self-transcendence did make an impact on easing the coming out process. Also ethnicity and education level were seen to be significant with Caucasian and higher education being the most likely to have higher levels of acceptance of their new sexual identity. These findings help to further shed light on the coming out process and mental health. However, additional research is needed to support these results, as barriers such as COVID-19 may have impacted results.

"An Observational Study to Assess the Impact of COVID-19 on the Factors Affecting the Mental Well-being of Doctoral Students","The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health far extend its effects on physical well-being. Long before the onset of COVID-19, there have been concerns related to the mental well-being of graduate students, especially doctoral students. This study evaluated the factors associated with the mental well-being of doctoral students since the onset of the pandemic using data collected from early career researchers in the UK in April 2020. The results show that the characteristics of mental well-being associated with social connection, loneliness, and anxiety have remained consistent during the lockdowns. Furthermore, everyday stressors related to lifestyle, finances, and caregiving responsibilities, alongside supervisors and university support, influenced the mental well-being of the doctoral students during the pandemic.","Dutta, Sreejata, Roy, Arundhati, Ghosh, Soham","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+Observational+Study+to+Assess+the+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+the+Factors+Affecting+the+Mental+Well-being+of+Doctoral+Students","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Trends in Psychology;: 1-16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35269,""
"Predictors of longer-term depression trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study in four UK cohorts","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in mental ill health compared with prepandemic levels. Longer-term trajectories of depression in adults during the pandemic remain unclear. We used latent growth curve modelling to examine individual trajectories of depression symptoms, and their predictors, beyond the early stage of the pandemic. Data were collected in three waves in May 2020, September/October 2020 and February/March 2021 in four UK cohorts (Millennium Cohort Study, Next Steps cohort, British Cohort and National Child Development Study). We included n=16Ã¢â‚¬â€°978 participants (mean age at baseline: 20, 30, 50 and 62, respectively). Self-reported depressive symptoms were the study outcome. Symptoms of depression were higher in younger compared with older age groups (d=0.7) across all waves. While depressive symptoms remained stable from May 2020 to Autumn 2020 overall (standardized mean difference (SMD)=0.03, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.04), they increased in all age groups from May 2020 to Spring 2021 (SMD=0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.13). Feelings of loneliness were the strongest predictor and concurrent correlate of increasing depressive symptoms across all cohorts, prepandemic mental health problems and having a long-term illness were also significantly associated with an increase in depression symptoms across all ages. By contrast, compliance with social distancing measures did not predict an increase in depression symptoms. Feeling lonely and isolated had a large effect on depression trajectories across all generations, while social distancing measures did not. These findings highlight the importance of fostering the feeling of connectedness during COVID-19-related distancing measures.","Rosa, Godwin, Cortese, Brandt","https://doi.org/10.1136/ebmental-2022-300461","20220728","COVID-19; adult psychiatry; depression &amp; mood disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35270,""
"Psychological distress and associated factors among healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","The objective of the study was to assess psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress) and associated factors among healthcare professionals working at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. Institution-based cross-sectional study. This study was conducted at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Study participants were healthcare professionals from University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. They were selected for the study using a stratified sampling technique. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale was used to assess the depression, anxiety and stress levels. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used to present the findings. To determine the predictor variables for depression, anxiety and stress, a binary logistic regression model was fitted. Finally, variables with p value &lt;0.05 in the final model were declared as significantly associated with psychological distress. Almost half (49.5) of the participants have psychological distress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers was 167 (42.7%), 201 (51.4%) and 242 (61.9%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, respondents found in the ages between 35 and 44; unmarried marital status; educational status with specialty, subspecialty and PhD holders; anaesthesia professionals; and healthcare professionals with known medical illness were significantly associated with depression. Unmarried marital status, anaesthesia professional, laboratory technologist and living with family were significantly associated with anxiety. Unmarried marital status; educational status with specialty, subspecialty and PhD holders; and anaesthesia professional were also statistically significant with stress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among the Gondar University healthcare professionals was high. This could contribute to implementation of mitigation measures in a standardised and sustainable manner and emphasis should be given to this aspect of health even for future similar and unanticipated events.","Demilew, Angaw, Getnet, Tesfaye, Atnafu, Andualem, Kerebih","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057197","20220728","COVID-19; adult psychiatry; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; epidemiology; suicide &amp; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35271,""
"Impact of a phone call with a medical student/general practitioner team on morbidity of chronic patients during the first French COVID-19 lockdown (COVIQuest): a cluster randomised trial","The first COVID-19 lockdown led to a significantly reduced access to healthcare, which may have increased decompensations in frail patients with chronic diseases, especially older patients living with a chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or a mental health disorder (MHD). The objective of COVIQuest was to evaluate whether a general practitioner (GP)-initiated phone call to patients with CVD and MHD during the COVID-19 lockdown could reduce the number of hospitalisation(s) over a 1-month period. This is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Clusters were GPs from eight French regions. Patients Ã¢â€°Â¥70 years old with chronic CVD (COVIQuest_CV subtrial) or Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years old with MHD (COVIQuest_MH subtrial). A standardised GP-initiated phone call aiming to evaluate patients' need for urgent healthcare, with a control group benefiting from usual care (ie, the contact with the GP was by the patient's initiative). Hospital admission within 1 month after the phone call. In the COVIQuest_CV subtrial, 131 GPs and 1834 patients were included in the intervention group and 136 GPs and 1510 patients were allocated to the control group. Overall, 65 (3.54%) patients were hospitalised in the intervention group vs 69 (4.57%) in the control group (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.20; risk difference -0.77, 95% CI -2.28 to 0.74). In the COVIQuest_MH subtrial, 136 GPs and 832 patients were included in the intervention group and 131 GPs and 548 patients were allocated to the control group. Overall, 27 (3.25%) patients were hospitalised in the intervention group vs 12 (2.19%) in the control group (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.81; risk difference 1.38, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.70).

"A perfect storm - how and why eating disorders in young people have thrived in lockdown and what is happening to address it","The number of children and young people referred to community eating disorders services escalated dramatically shortly after onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many presented with medical instability following restrictive eating and needed acute hospitalisation to correct malnutrition. In addition to the many risk factors for mental health problems that young people have been subjected to since onset of the pandemic, the question for eating disorders researchers, practitioners and policy makers is how, for so many, did it become about eating. In this editorial, some of the factors that may explain how eating, weight, shape and body image may have taken centre stage in young people's lives are explored.

"The experience of fathers during the covid-19 UK maternity care restrictions","During the COVID-19 pandemic fathers in the UK were excluded from many aspects of maternity care to reduce escalating transmission rates. This study explores the experiences of fathers who had a baby during the pandemic to understand what effect these maternity restrictions had on them and their relationship to the baby. A qualitative interview study of the experiences of fathers whose baby was born during the pandemic-related UK maternity restrictions. Non-probability voluntary response sampling of 20 fathers: including 13 primiparous fathers and 7 multiparous fathers. Eligibility criteria were that fathers lived in the UK and had a baby born on or after the 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2020; the start of the most severe COVID-19 maternity restrictions. Participants were interviewed remotely via telephone using semi-structured interviews which were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes, including ten sub-themes, were identified that described fathers' experiences of the maternity restrictions and the father-baby relationship. The themes were: (1) The impact on paternal experience: this theme describes a collective negative paternal maternity experience as a result of the restrictions. Notably, father exclusion produced feelings of isolation and a sense of loss, along with a disconnection from the pregnancy. (2) The impact on the father-baby relationship: this theme discusses the adverse consequence of the restrictions on initial father-baby bonding. (3) Observed impact on mothers: the observed detrimental impact that excluding fathers had on maternal mental health and well-being. Finally, (4) Fatherhood in the 'new normal': the change of daily living during the pandemic aided profound family relationship building, improving long-term father-baby bonding, compared to pre-pandemic conditions. The findings provide evidence of undesirable consequences the pandemic-related UK maternity restrictions had on birth partners. With restrictions to maternity care implemented across the globe, these concerns may be applicable at an international scale. This study adds to other contemporary literature on this subject and can inform discussion among maternity services of the importance of including fathers for improved parental well-being and initial infant bonding.","Andrews, Ayers, Williams","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2022.103434","20220728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35274,""
"Neurocognitive and Psychosocial Characteristics of Pediatric Patients With Post-Acute/Long-COVID: A Retrospective Clinical Case Series","Studies suggest a large number of patients have persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection-a condition termed ""long COVID."" Although children and parents often report cognitive difficulties after COVID, very few if any studies have been published including neuropsychological testing. A retrospective chart review was completed for the first 18 patients referred for a neuropsychological evaluation from a multidisciplinary pediatric post-COVID clinic. The neuropsychological screening battery assessed verbal fluency and category switching, attention, working memory, processing speed, and verbal learning and memory. Patients' caregivers also completed standardized questionnaires regarding day-to-day mood and behavior. At intake, the most common neurologic symptoms reported by caregivers were attention problems (83.3%), fatigue/lethargy (77.7%), sleep disturbance (77.7%), dizziness/vertigo (72.2%), and headaches (72.2%). On rating scales, most caregivers endorsed concerns for depressed mood and anxiety (14/15 and 12/15). A large proportion of patients had difficulties with attention (9/18) and depressed mood/anxiety (13/18) before COVID. On cognitive testing, the majority of the patients performed within or above broad average range (Ã¢â€°Â¥16th percentile) across most domains. However, a little over half of the patients performed below average on auditory attention measures. Within our clinically referred sample, children who reported lingering cognitive symptoms after COVID-19 often had a preexisting history of attention and/or mood and anxiety concerns. Many of these patients performed below average in attention testing, but it remains to be seen whether this was due to direct effects of COVID, physical symptoms, and/or preexisting difficulties with attention or mood/anxiety.","Ng, Vargas, Jashar, Morrow, Malone","https://doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acac056","20220728","Attention; COVID-19; Long COVID; Neuropsychiatry; Post-acute COVID syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35275,""
"Policies on mental health in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on both mental health and working conditions. Workplaces are conducive spaces for implementing strategies and interventions to promote mental health. In addition to this, they are preventing, identifying, and managing mental disorders effectively. Although international agencies have identified some guidelines for the management of mental health in the workplace in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a more precise characterization of both the components of the policies, their implementation, and evidence of the outcome is required to provide useful information for decision-makers. This study aims to synthesize scientific information regarding national and local policies focusing on preventing or improving, directly or indirectly, mental health problems in the workplace during COVID-19 pandemic. Our study is a scoping review. The Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases and PubMed search engine were used. Original and reviewed articles published from January 1, 2020 to October 14, 2021 were included in the research. Articles with abstract or full text in English, Spanish, German and Portuguese were also included. Our strategy is based on identifying policies (intervention) which focuses on directly or indirectly preventing or ameliorating mental health problems in the workplace during COVID-19 pandemic (participants). A total of 6,522 records were identified, and only four studies were included in the scoping review, which were of low quality. That is, we found limited evidence evaluating mental health policies using primary or secondary data (empirical evaluation). Among the policies that have been identified are the increase of mental health resources, the promotion of mental health and self-care support programs, and the reduction of barriers to access to mental health treatment. Our research finds that there is limited evidence available to evaluate national and local policies aimed at directly or indirectly preventing or ameliorating mental health problems at work during COVID-19 pandemic. This forces decision-makers to use different criteria to guide the allocation of resources and budgets. Therefore, there is a need for health intelligence teams in health systems to be able to assess the impact of policies as an important input for decision-makers.","Villarreal-Zegarra, ReÃƒÂ¡tegui-Rivera, Sabastizagal-Vela, Burgos-Flores, Cama-Ttito, Rosales-Rimache","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272296","20220728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35276,""
"Study Protocol and Preliminary Results of the Impact of Occupational Health Workers' Activities on Their Health: Nationwide Prospective Internet-Based Survey","Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, work environments and systems, as well as occupational health measures or activities that fall within our research field, are constantly changing. It is necessary to assess the impact of these changes on the physical and mental health of workers. To assess how occupational health measures affect the health of workers, we conducted a baseline, longitudinal internet-based survey among Japanese workers in October 2021 and additionally scheduled 2 follow-up surveys for 2022 and 2023. We describe the details of the protocol of the work systems and health internet research (WSHIR) study, provide an overview of the results of the baseline survey, and discuss the study procedures and data used in the study. This prospective cohort study was conducted online among internet monitors. The baseline survey was conducted from October 1 to 7, 2021. This study targeted those who were working and between the ages of 20 and 69 years. A total of 5111 respondents who passed the screening survey and proceeded to the main survey were enrolled according to collection units organized by sex and age. For the screening and main surveys, the questionnaire consisted of 9 and 33 items with 9 and 55 questions, respectively. Consistency and completeness checks were performed after the questionnaires were submitted. We compared basic characteristics, such as sex, age group, educational background, and marital status, among all participants, including those who withdrew from the analysis. Of the 5111 initial survey respondents, 571 (11.2%) were considered fraudulent. The data of the remaining 4540 (88.8%) participants (2273, 50.1%, males; 2267, 49.9%, females) included in the analysis were well balanced across participant sex and age groups according to the sampling plan because there was no significant difference by sex and age group using the chi-square test for checking the distribution bias of the participants (P=.84). Compared to female participants, male participants tended to be more likely to be managers and supervisors (323, 14.2%, males; 86, 3.8%, females), to work in a secondary industry (742, 32.6%, males; 357, 15.7%, females), and to have an annual income of Ã¢â€°Â¥5 million yen (976, 42.9%, males; 429, 18.9%, females). For the evaluation of a psychological indicator, Kessler 6 (K6) score, by sex and age group, the characteristics of the score distribution of the included participants were similar to those reported in previous studies. This study presents a protocol and overview of the results of an internet-based occupational health survey of workers. Using the results of this survey, we hope to evaluate the changes in occupational health activities and their impact on workers' health while controlling for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ikegami, Yoshimoto, Baba, Sekoguchi, Ando, Ogami","https://doi.org/10.2196/35290","20220728","COVID-19; Japan; cohort study; internet surveys; mental health; occupational health; online health; questionnaires; worker","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35277,""

This study assessed mental health in high school students 1.5Ã‚Â years after the pandemic began in Austria. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from September to November 2021. Well-being (WHO-5), depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep quality were assessed. A total of 1505 adolescents participated (78% girls). The cut-offs for clinically relevant symptoms were exceeded by 62% girls and 38.1% boys for depression (PHQ-9 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°11), 49% girls and 29% boys for anxiety (GAD-7 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°11) and 28% girls and 17% boys for insomnia (ISI scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°15). The prevalence of suicidal ideation (item 9 of the PHQ-9) within the last 2Ã‚Â weeks was 47% in girls and 32% in boys. These data collected in autumn 2021 (the start of the second semester of reopened schools; t2) were compared to data collected in February 2021 (one semester after remote schooling; t1). A matched pairs analysis according to age, gender, region, school type and migration background resulted in a total sample size of NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2514 adolescents. Results showed small deteriorations in mental health (i.e., well-being, depression, insomnia, suicidal ideation) in girls at t2 compared to t1, and an increase in suicidal thoughts in boys (all p-valuesÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Qualitative data show that young people have a need for more psychological support, both professional and informal, as well as increased mental health literacy. Results suggest that mental health burden in adolescents remains high 1.5Ã‚Â years into the pandemic and highlight the need to implement timely psychological support.","Dale, Jesser, Pieh, O'Rourke, Probst, Humer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02032-4","20220728","Adolescents; COVID-19; Mental health; Psychological support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35279,""

"Physical and psychological fatigue, and work performance among Brazilian workers during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in Brazil","The lockdown requirement, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), led to people having to follow a work from home regime. This pandemic made workers more vulnerable, causing emotional disorders that impacted their work performance. This online survey aimed to identify the psychological and emotional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Brazilian workers, testing the predictive effect between physical and emotional fatigue factors, and expectations about their performance. The participants were 153 workers from different sectors or departments of the University of Brasilia following the work from home modality. To achieve the main aim of this study, the questionnaire 'Feeling Fatigue Scale' by Yoshitake, and the nine items of the 'Achievement' factor of the 'Well-being at Work' questionnaire by Paschoal and Tamayowere applied. Study data were collected between February and August 2020. Statistically significant differences were found between cognitive aspects (difficulties in attention to work, <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .001,) expectations regarding performance (<i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .035), and the impact of fatigue on the body (<i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .021) when comparing the profile of workers from the areas of exact sciences, health, and social and human sciences. Workers who reported more extreme difficulty in attention had lower expectations regarding the performance achieved in the exercise of their duties (R<sup>2</sup> adjustedÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .271, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001).

"Comparing the Psychological Problems Among the Healthcare Workers Across Two Waves of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An observational study from India","Literature investigating the change in psychological problems of the healthcare workers (HCWs) throughout the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. We aimed at comparing the psychological problems and attitudes towards work among them over two waves of the COVID 19 pandemic in India. A survey was conducted involving HCWs (n=305, first-wave, 2020; n=325, second wave, 2021). Participants' demographic- and professional- and psychological characteristics (using attitude towards COVID-19 questionnaire [ATCQ]; Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items and impact of event scale-22) were recorded. The unpaired 't-test/chi-square test was used for comparison. A significant improvement in level of depression (42.2% vs 9.6%), anxiety (41.3% vs 16.3%), stress (30.1% vs 6.7%), event-related stress symptoms (31.2% vs 27%), work-related stress (89.8% vs 76.8%), and stigma (25.9% vs 22.8, though marginally significant) (<i>Ãâ€¡2(1</i>) =7.3 to 45.6, p&lt;0.05) were found among the participants of the second wave (vs. first wave). However, on subgroup analysis, allied-HCWs (housekeeping staff, and security personnel) reported lesser concerns over the domains of the KAQ vis-a-viz frontline-HCWs [doctors and nurses]. This improvement could be attributed to greater awareness about the illness, better coping skills, vaccination, etc, however, more research is warranted to investigate these determinants.","Gupta, Basera, Purwar, Poddar, Rozatkar, Kumar, Jahan, Gautam","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.192","20220728","COVID 19; India; anxiety; comparison; depression; health workforce; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35283,""

The research questions and results are structured according to Watson's Theory of Human Caring. The study was conducted using a descriptive qualitative research design. The phenomenological method was used to explore the experiences of survivors of COVID-19. A total of 34 survivors of COVID-19 were included in the study. Data were collected using semi-structured and open-ended questions online and via telephone interviews between February and March 2020. Data were evaluated using thematic analysis and descriptive analysis. Six main themes and twenty-five sub-themes were defined that describe the experiences of survivors of COVID-19 regarding the illness: (a) Denial and adaptation, (b) Fear, (c) Feeling of hopelessness, (d) Preventions (e) Meaning attribution, and (f) Metaphors about COVID-19. Information from this research may be used by healthcare professionals to develop new strategies for the care of survivors of COVID-19.

This mixed methods study utilized both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Participants were 27 adults with intellectual disabilities who participated in the 6-week course. Participants completed measures of self-efficacy and well-being at three time points and qualitative satisfaction measures at post and follow-up. Attendance was high and the course was feasible and acceptable to participants. Positive changes related to mental health self-efficacy were detected (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .01), though mental well-being did not improve.

"[The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Healthcare System and on the Mental Health of Primary Health Care Providers]","The COVID-19 pandemic forced the reorganization of primary health care services. The aim of this study was to describe how the health services responded to organizational requests; how the health services involved and supported their employees; how professionals perceived their involvement in the procedures and what support was provided to them. Additions aims included assessing the levels of anxiety and depression of professionals and their association with the perceived support, availability of personal protective equipment and involvement in pandemic-related tasks. Cross-sectional, analytical study directed at professionals from three health center groups using an online questionnaire. We collected information from sociodemographic data, access to personal protective equipment, perceived support, workload and levels of anxiety and depression. Between each variable and the levels of anxiety and depression, multivariate logistic regression was applied. There were responses from 237 professionals (83.8% women; mean age 43.7 years; 43.2% physicians). Almost 60% worked with COVID-19 patients. The availability of personal protective equipment in March versus June 2020 increased (17.7% vs 55.3%). There was a risk management plan in 86% of the workplaces. A high workload (90%) and time pressure (74.6%) were identified. Physicians and nurses had a higher prevalence of depression associated with workload and fatigue (p &lt; 0.001). Protective anxiety factors were having space to talk about problems, support in face of these problems and having a place to relax in the health unit. A lower risk of depression was found in the administrative staff group, in those who felt supported, and in those who actively participated in the contingency plans. The COVID-19 pandemic led to considerable changes in the dynamics of primary health care. The time pressure to carry out tasks and the level of concentration required were associated with a higher risk of mental disease. The support felt by healthcare professionals regarding their problems and concerns and the existence of places to relax in the health units were identified as protective factors. Health promotion, the maintenance of the social contacts of healthcare professionals and their involvement in the processes should be taken into account in the organizational dynamics of the institutions.

Colhemos dados sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficos, informaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o sobre o acesso a equipamento de proteÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o individual, apoio percecionado, carga de trabalho e nÃƒÂ­veis de ansiedade e depressÃƒÂ£o. Entre cada variÃƒÂ¡vel e os nÃƒÂ­veis de ansiedade e depressÃƒÂ£o aplicou-se regressÃƒÂ£o logÃƒÂ­stica multivariada.Resultados: Responderam 237 profissionais (83,8% mulheres; idade mÃƒÂ©dia 43,7 anos; 43,2% de mÃƒÂ©dicos). Quase 60% trabalhou com doentes COVID-19. A disponibilidade de equipamento de proteÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o individual em marÃƒÂ§o versus junho de 2020 aumentou (17,7% vs 55,3%). Existia plano de gestÃƒÂ£o do risco em 86% dos locais. Identificou-se uma alta carga de trabalho (90%) e pressÃƒÂ£o do tempo (74,6%). MÃƒÂ©dicos e enfermeiros apresentavam maior prevalÃƒÂªncia de depressÃƒÂ£o associada Ãƒ carga de trabalho e fadiga (p &lt; 0,001). Ter espaÃƒÂ§o para falar dos problemas, apoio sentido perante esses problemas e dispor na unidade de saÃƒÂºde de um espaÃƒÂ§o para relaxar foram alguns fatores protetores de ansiedade.

"Preliminary investigation of the student-delivered Community Outreach teleheAlth program for Covid education and Health promotion (COACH)","COVID-19 public health restrictions (i.e. physical distancing) compromise individuals' ability to self-manage their health behaviours and may increase the risks of adverse health events. To evaluate the student-delivered Community Outreach teleheAlth program for Covid education and Health promotion (COACH) on health-directed behaviour (self-management) among older adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years of age, n = 75). Secondary objectives estimated the influence of COACH on perceived depression, anxiety, and stress; social support; health-related quality of life; health promotion self-efficacy; and other self-management domains. COACH was developed to provide chronic disease management and prevention support among older adults via telephone or videoconferencing platforms (i.e. Zoom). In this single-group, pre-post study, our primary outcome was measured using the health-directed behaviour subscale of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire. Secondary measures included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Medical Outcomes Study: Social Support Survey, MOS Short Form-36, and Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices Scale. Paired sample t-tests were used to analyse outcome changes. Mean age of participants was 72.4 years (58.7% female; 80% Ã¢â€°Â¥2 chronic conditions). Health-directed behaviour significantly improved after COACH (P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.45). Improved health promotion self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.44) and decreased mental health were also observed (P &lt; 0.001, d = -1.69). COACH likely contributed to improved health-directed behaviour and health promotion self-efficacy despite the diminished mental health-related quality of life during COVID-19.

"Depression, Stress and the Mediating Role of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Among Israeli Women of Childbearing Age in the Shadow of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Dealing with the outbreak of the new coronavirus has generated unprecedented challenges around the world, including in Israel. Women of childbearing age may be forced to live under particularly difficult circumstances during the pandemic. The current study among Israeli women of childbearing age has three main objectives related to the specific period of the COVID-19 pandemic: to study the prevalence and predictors of intimate partner violence (IPV); to investigate the prevalence and predictors of depression; to examine whether IPV mediates the association between general stress, fear of COVID-19 and depression as an outcome. In a cross-sectional study, 722 married women, Jewish and Arab residents of Israel, were recruited to answer an online self-completion questionnaire during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included an assessment of their degree of general stress and depression, fear of COVID-19, experiences of IPV and demographic variables. The results of the current study show that a high percentage of women reported IPV (with Muslim women reporting higher IPV than Jewish women), perceived stress (PSS), perceived COVID-19 stress and depression. The findings also show that IPV and its three dimensions mediate the relationship between COVID-19 stress and depression, such that higher stress was related to higher IPV, raising the odds for depression. Moreover, the total scores for IPV and emotional violence were found to mediate the relationship between stress and depression. That is, domestic violence explains part of the association between stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the current pandemic has resulted in an increase in IPV and depression, and especially in the specific stress associated with the disease itself. Based on the findings of the current study, preventing violence will reduce stress-related depression. The Muslim population, and especially those who are more religious, is in particular need of intervention.","Halperin, Ali-Saleh, Ore, Jadaon","https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605221111415","20220728","anything related to domestic violence; cultural contexts; domestic violence; domestic violence and cultural contexts; sexual assault","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35288,""

"The Forgotten Youth: Responding to Mental Health Needs Among Confined Youth in the Time of COVID-19","As COVID-19 sweeps across the country, individuals within the carceral system face an increased risk of contracting the virus, and as a result, heightened risk for mental health symptoms. We discuss how COVID-19 appears to be exacerbating mental health inequities for children within the carceral system and the need to respond accordingly. Children within the carceral system represent a particularly vulnerable population, and the majority of detained or confined youth identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). As juvenile detention centers in multiple states report cases of COVID-19, children who are confined are experiencing higher rates of illness and fear of illness. It is crucial to consider how the mental health of children who are confined will be disproportionately affected compared with the general population. We provide recommendations to revise practices to improve and reduce mental health outcomes among confined children.","Sanikommu, Fix","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399221113224","20220728","child/adolescent health; health disparities; health equity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35290,""
"Psychiatric symptoms in children with COVID-19, mothers` psychological resilience and related factors: pandemic hospital inpatient experiences","Information on psychological problems and affecting factors in children hospitalized with the suspicion or diagnosis of COVID-19 is limited. We aimed to screen the psychiatric symptoms of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Ankara City Children`s Hospital and evaluate the caregivers` depression, anxiety, stress, and resilience levels during hospitalization. Among the children and adolescents hospitalized in Ankara City Children`s Hospital between 1 May 2020 and 31 May 2020 due to the diagnosis of COVID-19, those who agreed to participate in the study were included. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS- 21) scale, and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) were used to determine the symptoms. The mean age of study group (n = 49) was 8.7 Ã‚Â± 5.0 years, 59.2% (n = 29) were girls. The mean children`s SDQ-externalizing problems scores were higher in the COVID-19 positive mothers group than the COVID-19 negative mothers` group. The SDQ-total score was positively and strongly correlated with the DASS total score, DASS-depression score, and DASS-anxiety score. BRS scale scores were negatively correlated with the SDQtotal, externalizing, and DASS-21scale scores. COVID-19 positivity in mothers could be associated with externalizing problems in children. The high resilience of caregivers of inpatients seems to be related to less psychopathology in children.

In the present study, we investigate the changes in physical, social and mental health, as well as the health literacy of Australians subsequent to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, and examine the influence of loneliness on these health-related factors. Using a retrospective cross-sectional study design, 607 Australian adults completed a self-report online survey which assessed their health-related factors before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (data collected between June 2020 to November 2020). Australians reported statistically significant increase in a number of (poorer) health-related factors (e.g., weight gain, sleeping difficulties, poor somatic health, higher loneliness, more issues navigating the healthcare system) post onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Further, after adjusting for covariates, higher loneliness during pandemic predicted poorer health-related outcomes (e.g., more somatic health complaints, poorer quality of diet, poorer social support for health). The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated social and physical distancing restrictions may have contributed towards poorer health-related factors among Australian adults.

"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Toward Tuberculosis Among Hospital Outpatients in Kabul, Afghanistan","Tuberculosis (TB) is a high-burden respiratory infectious disease. There was a sharp decline in the number of confirmed TB cases during the pandemic; this is likely to be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic response, with under-reporting due to resource diversion. There are typically 13,000 tuberculosis-associated deaths in Afghanistan annually, with significant problems posed by drug-resistant TB. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in Afghanistan on Kabul residents who visited the adult outpatient departments of public hospitals for any health-related reason from 1st January to 20th March 2022. The study scored their knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) toward tuberculosis. The sample size was calculated using Epi-Info, and the minimum sample size was 385. The sampling method is chosen the non-probability convenient sampling for data gathering. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 28, and we used the Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square or fisher extract test, spearman correlations, and binary logistic regression model. Of 829 participants, 450 (54.3%) were males and 379 (45.7) females. The median age was 28 years, and 63.3% were married. Most participants were unemployed (75.5%), but 54% had a monthly income &gt;3,000 Afghanis, indicating the reliance on family. By TB knowledge score, 727 (87.7%) participants had good knowledge, and 800 (96.5%) participants had a positive attitude toward treatment and control. Only 2 participants reported poor practices regarding prevention. Regarding the binary logistic regression, young age, being a male, belonging to the ""1,000-3,000"" Afghani monthly income category, and having a positive attitude were significant predictors of good TB knowledge (<i>P</i>-value = 0.009, 0.000, 0.003, and 0.009), respectively.

"The Rise of Functional Tic-Like Behaviors: What Do the COVID-19 Pandemic and Social Media Have to Do With It? A Narrative Review","There has been a rise in explosive onset of tic-like behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, this is an uncommon phenomenology of functional movement disorders across all ages. Both the psychological burden of the pandemic and social media usage have been implicated in the rise of these tic-like behaviors. This paper provides a narrative review of the literature on chronic tic disorders, functional tics, and mass functional illness with particular focus on the key distinguishing features, role of social media, and the role of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the mental health of many individuals, including children, adolescents, and their caregivers. Implementation of lockdowns, lifestyle disruptions, school closures, and social distancing have driven a surge in social media and digital technology use. The combination of predisposing factors, the psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and social media are implicated in the rise and spread of tic-like behaviors; which may represent a modern-day form of mass functional illness. While many of the features overlap with functional tics, there are emerging distinctive features that are important to recognize. A more encompassing term, <i>Functional Tic-Like Behaviors</i>, is used to better reflect multiple contributing factors. Knowledge of these differences is essential to mitigate downstream health effects and poor outcomes.","Martindale, Mink","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.863919","20220728","COVID-19; TikTok; functional movement disorders; functional tic; mass psychogenic illness; tic; tic-like behavior; tourette","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35295,""
"Exploring the Necessity of Psychological Rounds and Psychological Interventions in General Hospitals in the Post-COVID-19 Period","To explore the necessity of psychological rounds and psychological intervention in the post-COVID-19 period in a general hospital. Based on the current pandemic influence on Chinese people's psychology, the medical experience, and environment were analyzed, and the feasibility of psychological evaluation and intervention were appraised with the psychological changes that might be brought by the medical behaviors, especially for surgical operations. Nowadays, the pandemic is under full control in China, although the pandemic is rampant abroad. In China, the ""Normalized pandemic prevention"" phase has begun. In the post-COVID-19 period, the prolonged pandemic has made numerous people pessimistic, angry, and other negative emotions. Several general hospitals are facing huge influences: under the influence of anxiety, such as ""higher hospital-acquired infection rate,"" the patient attendance rate is reduced, and the hospital income is sharply reduced. Doctor-patient conflicts are more likely to occur during the medical procedures, affecting the medical experience, and reducing the rate of re-visit and referral. After analyzing a series of ""endogenous"" and ""exogenous"" factors of medical procedures in a general hospital in the post-pandemic period, it suggests that anxiety and depression caused by uncertainties in the medical procedures may be more obvious. Also, it is necessary to pay attention to the psychological status of patients and carry out psychological rounds and psychological interventions in general hospitals. The service quality can be improved, the medical experience can be ameliorated, and it can help general hospitals to turn ""crisis"" into ""opportunity,"" which also brings better development.","Tang, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.916776","20220728","general hospital; post-COVID-19 period; post-pandemic period; psychological interventions; psychological rounds","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35296,""
"Problems Facing Healthcare Providers When Caring for COVID-19 Patients: An Integrative Review","The COVID-19 outbreak is a world health problem that affects millions of people. The pandemic is also causing burdens and challenges to health-care providers. Therefore, this study aimed to examine and help understand health-care providers' problems when caring for COVID-19 patients. An integrative review following Whittemore and Kanfl's approach was used along with a systematic search for emerging online databases and grey literature conducted from January to August 2021. The quality of papers was analyzed and a report was presented following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 18 articles that were predominantly descriptive with five themes, including mental health problems in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, working stress, physical and psychological impacts of disease, and the lack of support were analyzed.

"Influencing Factors of Mental Health Status of Dentists Under COVID-19 Epidemic","To investigate dentists' psychological status and influencing factors in Shaanxi Province during the COVID-19 epidemic and assess their perceived wellness. The study was conducted among dentists from Shaanxi Province in China. The basic information was collected through the network questionnaire star platform. Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-42) and Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS) were used to assess subjects' psychological status and perceived wellness. Univariate linear regression analysis and multivariate analysis were performed on the influencing factors of depression, anxiety, and stress, and <i>t</i>-test and analysis of variance were used to analyze the perceived wellness results. The results demonstrated that 33.2% of the surveyed dentists were in a state of depression, 37.1% were anxious, and 34.4% reported stress among 256 subjects. Linear Regression analysis results showed that: ""years of working,"" ""the impact of COVID-19 on their life, work, and sleep,"" ""worrying about occupational exposure/virus infection,"" ""lacking the awareness of prevention and control measures,"" ""overtime work during the epidemic,"" ""worrying about participating in the supporting work,"" and ""continuous exhaustion from work"" were significant contributors to depression, anxiety, and stress status. In addition, the results of PWS found that each dimension of PWS was correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress state, which indicates the individual's physical and mental health state was associated with multiple factors. COVID-19 has significantly impacted dentists' mental health in Shaanxi Province.

Seven hundred and ninety college students participated in the study and completed questionnaires on life satisfaction, suicidal ideation, depression, and gratitude. Findings indicated that (1) Depression played a partial mediating role between life satisfaction and suicidal ideation. Life satisfaction was not only directly affected suicidal ideation, but also indirectly affected suicidal ideation through the mediating effect of college students' depression; (2) Gratitude played a moderating role in the effect of life satisfaction on depression, and the link between life satisfaction and suicide ideation was only significant for those with higher gratitude.

"Impulsivity and Depressive Brooding in Internet Addiction: A Study With a Sample of Italian Adolescents During COVID-19 Lockdown","This contribution presents a study conducted on a sample of Italian adolescents (<i>n</i> = 411) in the period of the first COVID-19 lockdown. The study investigated the role and predictive weight of the impulsivity and depressive brooding variables on Internet addiction, using a hierarchical regression analysis. The participants were administered the <i>Uso-Abuso e Dipendenza da Internet</i> [Internet Use-Abuse and Addiction] (UADI-2), the <i>Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11</i> (BIS-11), and the <i>Ruminative Response Scale</i> (RRS). In terms of percentage distribution, 28% of the participants were in the full dependency range, while 34.7% demonstrated Internet abuse behavior. The results highlighted not only the predictive value of impulsiveness (ÃŽÂ² = 0.323) and ruminative thinking (ÃŽÂ² = 0.258), but also the role of gender (ÃŽÂ² = -0.205) on Internet addiction. Thus, male participants showed higher levels of Internet addiction, with higher scores on impulsiveness and brooding way of thinking. The study shows that the issue in question is significantly present among adolescents; in addition, not only targeted awareness programmes but also psycho-educational and clinical interventions to promote greater emotional and cognitive control would be necessary as a preventive and mitigating measure. Psychological interventions can help increase self-awareness, develop emotional regulation and impulse control, and correct maladaptive cognitions which in adolescents are mostly driven by a ruminative cognitive style.","Diotaiuti, Girelli, Mancone, Corrado, Valente, Cavicchiolo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.941313","20220728","COVID-19; Internet addiction; adolescents; attentional impulsivity; depression; gender; motor impulsivity; ruminative thinking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35300,""

"The Impact of Gender and Age Differences and Infectious Disease Symptoms on Psychological Distress in Quarantined Asymptomatic or Mildly Ill COVID-19 Patients in Japan","Quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 infection can exacerbate psychological distress, and it is important for a public mental health agency to identify factors that are predictive of high psychological distress in such situation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether gender, age, and the presence or absence of infectious disease symptoms affected psychological distress among asymptomatic or mildly ill COVID-19 patients who were quarantined. Participants were 436 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19-infected patients who were quarantined in a treatment facility between 1 May 2020 and 30 September 2021. We used Quantification Theory I analysis to investigate the effects of gender, age, and the nature of infectious disease symptoms on psychological distress. The results of the analysis showed that the contribution rate was 0.06. Among gender, age, presence of symptoms, and the nature of symptoms, age had the greatest effect on psychological distress, and being in one's teens to thirties was considered to exacerbate psychological distress the most.

"Association between Social Engagements and Stigmatization of COVID-19 Infection among Community Population in Japan","In the face of unknown risks, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we tend to have stigmatized perceptions. The current study aimed to examine the association of social engagements with the level of stigmatization of COVID-19 infection among the general population. The data of 429 participants of the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seroprevalence neighborhood association (U-CORONA) study, a population-based cohort study conducted in Utsunomiya City, Japan, were analyzed. Their stigmatized perception of people with COVID-19 infection was evaluated via a questionnaire for the situation if they or others in their community were to get infected. The association between social engagements (community social capital, social network diversity, and social network size) and stigmatization were analyzed by a multiple linear regression model with generalized estimating equations. Overall, females reported a higher stigmatized perception of people with COVID-19 than males. Lower education and depressive symptoms were also positively associated with higher stigmatization, while age, household income, and comorbidities were not. People with higher community social capital reported lower stigmatization (B = -0.69, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.16), while social network diversity and social network size did not show an association with stigmatization. We found an association between community social capital and stigmatization, suggesting that enhancing their community social capital, but not social network diversity and size, has the potential to mitigate the levels of stigmatization.","Koyama, Nawa, Yamaoka, Nishimura, Kuramochi, Fujiwara","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159050","20220728","COVID-19; pandemic; social capital; social network; social punishment; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35306,""
"Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Socio-Demographic and Behavioural Correlates during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Estonia","The aim of the study was to analyse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among the Estonian general population and its socio-demographic and behavioural correlates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal data on 1781 individuals from an Estonian rapid-assessment survey on COVID-19 were used. HRQoL was assessed with the EQ-5D-3L in June 2020 (baseline) and in May 2021 (follow-up). The HRQoL index score and its socio-demographic and behavioural variations were analysed using paired <i>t</i>-tests and Tobit regression modelling. Statistically significant declines in mean EQ-5D index scores were observed for all socio-demographic and behavioural variables considered. Most of these changes were due to increased reporting of problems in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression health domains. Older age, being unemployed or economically non-active and having financial difficulties were significantly associated with lower HRQoL in both baseline and follow-up measurements. In the follow-up data, women had significantly lower HRQoL compared to men, whereas higher education proved to be the only protective factor regarding HRQoL. Unhealthy dietary habits and low physical activity had a negative impact on the HRQoL score in the follow-up data.

"Systematic Review of COVID-19-Related Physical Activity-Based Rehabilitations: Benefits to Be Confirmed by More Robust Methodological Approaches","The first emergency was to receive and treat COVID-19 patients in their acute phase; today, there is a clear need to propose appropriate post-acute rehabilitation programs. The aim of this research was to systematically review the effects of physical activity programs in the recovery of post-COVID-19 patients. The literature search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022289219), and was conducted between August and December 2021. A total of 35 studies out of the 1528 initially identified were finally included in the analysis. The systematic review clearly showed the health benefits of rehabilitation including physical activity in post-COVID-19 recovery, regardless of exercise modalities. These positive results were even observed using minor muscle re-mobilization for severe cases (i.e., postural changes, few steps-2 times/day) or using low volumes of exercise for mild-to-moderate cases (i.e., 120 min/week). A total of 97% of the 29 studies that performed statistical analyses demonstrated a significant increase in at least one parameter of functional capacity, and 96% of the 26 studies that statistically investigated the effects on the quality of life, mental health, and general state reported improvements. Yet, most of the studies were retrospective, uncontrolled, and enrolled aged people with comorbidities presented in severe forms of COVID-19. Physical activity programs, in addition to their high heterogeneity, remained poorly described in 83% of the studies and were part of a multidisciplinary program for 89% of the studies.

"Generating High-Granularity COVID-19 Territorial Early Alerts Using Emergency Medical Services and Machine Learning","The pandemic of COVID-19 has posed unprecedented threats to healthcare systems worldwide. Great efforts were spent to fight the emergency, with the widespread use of cutting-edge technologies, especially big data analytics and AI. In this context, the present study proposes a novel combination of geographical filtering and machine learning (ML) for the development and optimization of a COVID-19 early alert system based on Emergency Medical Services (EMS) data, for the anticipated identification of outbreaks with very high granularity, up to single municipalities. The model, implemented for the region of Lombardy, Italy, showed robust performance, with an overall 80% accuracy in identifying the active spread of the disease. The further post-processing of the output was implemented to classify the territory into five risk classes, resulting in effectively anticipating the demand for interventions by EMS. This model shows state-of-art potentiality for future applications in the early detection of the burden of the impact of COVID-19, or other similar epidemics, on the healthcare system.","Gianquintieri, Brovelli, Pagliosa, Dassi, Brambilla, Bonora, Sechi, Caiani","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159012","20220728","COVID-19; emergency medical services; geo-AI; geographic information system; health geomatics; machine learning; resources management; spatial filtering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35310,""
"Group Homes and COVID-19: Perspectives of Youth Residents, Staff, and Caregivers","This study explored the perspectives of being in a youth group home during the COVID-19 pandemic from youth residents, staff, and caregivers. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 9 youth residents, 8 group home staff members, and 13 caregivers of residents. All participants were connected to the group home before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to identify lived experience themes. Two overarching themes were identified among the youth residents-<i>Safety response to COVID-19</i> and <i>Socialization changes due to COVID</i>-along with three subthemes: <i>Structure leading to separation, Support and belonging amid a pandemic,</i> and <i>Competency.</i> Three overarching themes were identified among the group home staff: <i>Safety response to COVID-19, Increased responsibility,</i> and <i>Mental health changes because of a pandemic.</i> Finally, three overarching themes were identified among the guardians of youth residents: <i>Safety response to COVID-19, Belief in a mental health impact on the child,</i> and <i>Communication during a pandemic.</i> Conclusions: The findings provide the experiences among three group home stakeholders. Overall, they demonstrated resilience in a setting and time when resilience was essential. Finally, the findings offer insight on the basis of which group homes/organizations can prepare for crises of a great magnitude, including vital communication elements.","Howey, Assadollahi, Lundahl","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158978","20220728","COVID-19; caregivers; group home; staff; youth residents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35311,""
"The Need for Psychological Support of Health Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Influence on Their Work","The aim of this research was to analyze how the need for psychological support of health workers (HCWs) influenced the beliefs, perceptions and attitudes towards their work during the COVID-19 pandemic and to predict the need of psychological assistance. A descriptive transversal study was conducted based on a self-administered questionnaire distributed to health professionals working in the Canary Islands, Spain. The data were analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared test and the linear trend test. The correlation test between ordinal and frequency variables was applied using Kendall's Tau B. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict dichotomous variables. The sample included 783 health professionals: 17.8% (<i>n</i> = 139) of them needed psychological or psychiatric support. Being redeployed to other services influenced the predisposition to request psychological help, and HCWs who required psychological support had more negative attitudes and perceptions towards their work. After five waves of COVID-19, these HCWs reported to be physically, psychologically and emotionally exhausted or even ""burned out""; they did not feel supported by their institutions. The commitment of health personnel to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic decreased after the five waves, especially among professionals who required psychological support.","Santana-LÃƒÂ³pez, Santana-Padilla, Bernat-Adell, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-MartÃƒÂ­n, Santana-Cabrera","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158970","20220728","COVID-19; attitudes of health personnel; emotions; health personnel; mental health; pandemics; work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35312,""
"Suicide and Attempted Suicide in Poland before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic between 2019 and 2021","The COVID-19 pandemic is related to changes in rates of suicide and suicide attempts in many countries, and some differences have been observed regarding the prevalence of suicidal behaviours in different age and gender groups. The aim of this study is to analyse the number of suicides and suicide attempts per 100,000 people between 2019 and 2021 in Poland. Using police and government data on suicide and suicide attempts in Poland, three age categories were investigated: 13-24 years old, 25-65 years old, and above 65 years old, and the analysis encompassed the whole population and the populations of men and women separately. Study results indicated an increase in suicide attempts in the two younger age categories (aged 7-24 years and 25-65 years) between 2021 and 2019-2020. There was an increase in suicide among women in all age categories during the study period, whilst no increase was observed in suicide in men in any age group. The differences in the prevalence of suicide and attempted suicide in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic in different age and gender groups indicate the need for tailored suicide prevention activities.","StaÃ…â€ždo, CzabaÃ…â€žski, Fechner, Baum, Andriessen, KrysiÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158968","20220728","COVID-19; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35313,""
"Buffering the Effects of Burnout on Healthcare Professionals' Health-The Mediating Role of Compassionate Relationships at Work in the COVID Era","Managing the COVID-19 pandemic posed several challenges for healthcare professionals, which likely heightened their risk of burnout (Amanullah and Ramesh Shankar, 2020) and, consequently, their general physical and mental health. Although it may not be possible to address and eliminate the causes of burnout, current research informs healthcare organizations about protective strategies to reduce its detrimental consequences. The promotion of compassionate interactions among healthcare professionals may play such a role. Compassion within healthcare organizations positively affects individual performance and well-being. Building on these considerations and within the framework of the Conservation of Resources theory, this study explores the relationships among burnout dimensions, received compassion at work, and general health in 711 Italian healthcare professionals (68.5% female), aged between 21 and 73 years (M<sub>age</sub> = 36.4, SD = 11.2). Analyses were conducted to investigate the association between burnout and general well-being (H1) and between burnout symptoms and perceived compassion at work (H2); and the mediational role of compassion in the relationship between burnout symptoms and general well-being. H1 and H2 were confirmed (<i>r</i> &amp;lt; 0.01 for both), and a SEM model showed the mediating role of compassion at work in the association between burnout symptoms and general well-being (RMSEA &amp;lt; 0.08, SRMR &amp;lt; 0.08, CFI and TLI &amp;gt; 0.90). Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed in the paper.","Buonomo, Santoro, Benevene, Borrelli, Angelini, Fiorilli, Gualano, Moscato","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158966","20220728","COR theory; burnout; compassion at work; healthcare workers; occupational medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35314,""
"How the 5G Enabled the COVID-19 Pandemic Prevention and Control: Materiality, Affordance, and (De-)Spatialization","5G, the most disruptive innovation, had played a significant role in the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. However, as a novel technology and context, we have little knowledge about how 5G enabled pandemic prevention and control. This study collected 212 cases and conducted qualitative research to explore how the 5G worked in prevention and control. Based on the concepts of materiality and affordance, we grounded two affordances of spatialization and de-spatialization from the data. Spatialization provides non-contact ways to complete the tasks which are supposed to be completed in contact, and de-spatialization provides remote operations to complete the tasks which are supposed to be completed on-site. Spatialization and de-spatialization enabled the diagnosis and treatment of the infectors to relieve the unbalance of medical staff, cutting the infectious route to contain the viral spread, and logistic supply to support the prevention and control. Our study offers theoretical contributions to digital pandemic prevention and control, and the literature on 5G also offers practical implications.","Li, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158965","20220728","5G; COVID-19 pandemic; affordance; materiality; spatialization and de-spatialization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35315,""
"Mental Health during the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Hong Kong Study","This study addressed the impact on mental health and wellbeing in relation to views of the self, the world, and the future during the early stage of the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak. An online survey battery included the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Subjective Happiness Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, Adult Hope Scale, and two specifically-written items measuring the valence quality and quantity of the impact of the pandemic. A total of 345 Hong Kong residents (54% females) responded; 17.1%, 24.7%, and 19.7% reported elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The prevalence of these issues was lower in this Hong Kong sample than reported in other COVID-19 studies, possibly due to the past experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong in promoting the voluntary wearing of masks in public places and introducing social distancing measures during the early first wave of the pandemic. Correlational analyses showed associations between positive views about the self (higher self-compassion), the world (higher positive valence), and the future (more hope) and better mental health and psychological wellbeing (fewer depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; more happiness). Regression analyses indicated a differential predicting power of the three views on the four selected mental health and psychological wellbeing indicators. Intervention programs to alleviate distress and/or promote better wellbeing should be matched to the specific problems encountered by the sufferers.","Cheung, Wu, Chui","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158957","20220728","COVID-19; Hong Kong; hope; mental health; self-compassion; valence of event","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35316,""
"Relationship between Income and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic in China","Mental health problems represent one most pressing concerns in the world, which produce costly consequences for individuals, families and society as a whole. One of the determinants on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is income. To complement relevant research and provide valuable recommendations for governments and societies, this study investigates the nexus between income and mental health in China by employing 8049 observations from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies. Using ordinary least squares regression we find the significant positive relationship between income and mental health, and estimate the effect of income on mental health. Furthermore, this effect is heterogeneous depending on individuals' education level and registered residence type. Finally, individuals' economic status and happiness are shown to be the potential mechanism through which the effect of income on mental health operates.","Li, Zhou, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158944","20220728","COVID-19; China; education; happiness; income; mental health; registered residence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35317,""
"Effects of COVID-19 on Adolescent Mental Health and Internet Use by Ethnicity and Gender: A Mixed-Method Study","Evidence suggests that mental health problems in young people have been exacerbated by COVID-19, possibly related to a lack of social connection. Young people report using the internet for connecting with their peers and mental health support. However, how they may have used the internet for support during COVID-19 is not clear. We wanted to know how mood and internet use may have changed in young people during COVID-19 and if this was different for those with and without depression symptoms. 108 adolescents were recruited. Participants with high and low levels of depressive symptomatology answered questions about their mood, internet use, loneliness and life satisfaction during July and August 2020. We found that the high depression group reported significantly more loneliness and less life satisfaction than the low depression group. We found that most young people used the internet for mental health information during COVID-19 but that the high depression group used the internet more for mental health information than the low depression group. The high depression group also had a worsening of mood compared to the low depression group during COVID-19. We found that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic participants reported increased use of the internet compared to White participants during COVID-19 and that the role of the family facilitated coping during COVID-19 for some adolescents, but for others, it made the lockdown more difficult. Finally, we found that adolescents perceived school anxiety as stressful as COVID-19. To conclude this study supports the use of the internet as a way to help young people with mental health challenges. It also suggests that the internet is a way to help young people from ethnic minorities, who otherwise might be hard to reach, during challenging times. This study also shows that supportive family units can be important during times of stress for young people and that school anxiety is a major issue for young people in today's society even outside of the pandemic.","Kaya, McCabe","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158927","20220728","COVID-19; adolescent mental health; ethnicity; internet use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35318,""
"Increase in Referrals of Children and Adolescents to the Psychiatric Emergency Room Is Evident Only in the Second Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic-Evaluating 9156 Visits from 2010 through 2021 in a Single Psychiatric Emergency Room","<b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic affected the wellbeing of children and adolescents. The psychiatric emergency room (ER) is the hub of psychiatric emergencies and reflects clinically significant mental problems. Previous studies compared 2019 and 2020 and observed a decline in ER referrals. The current study focused on the continuous trend of referrals from 2010 to the end of 2021. <b>Method:</b> In our observational retrospective study, we procured data from 9156 child and adolescent referrals to our psychiatric ER. The comparison was made based on similar months of each year. <b>Results:</b> There was a significant positive trend in monthly referrals between 2010 and 2021, representing a similar increase in referrals per month in comparison to that month in the preceding year (<i>unstandardized ÃŽÂ²</i> = 4.21, 95% <i>CI</i> = 3.44 to 4.98, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001). Between March 2020 and February 2021 (monthly visits = 72.5 + 16.6 [median = 79.5], annual referrals = 870), we observed no additive effect beyond this general trend after controlling for population growth. Conversely, between March and December 2021 (monthly referrals = 106.1 + 31.8 [median = 105.5], overall referrals = 1061) we observed a significant additive effect beyond the projected incline, as predicted by previous years (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 21.61, 95% <i>CI</i> = 12.12 to 31.06, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001). <b>Conclusions:</b> The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was no different from the continuous decade long rise of referrals to the children and adolescents' psychiatric ER. Conversely, the second year showed an additional incline beyond the general trend. The complexity in this rising need demands the awareness of clinicians and policy makers alike.","Dror, Hertz-Palmor, Yadan-Barzilai, Saker, Kritchmann-Lupo, Bloch","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158924","20220728","COVID-19; pediatric mental health; psychiatric emergency room","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35319,""
"Mental Health Risk Factors and Coping Strategies among Students in Asia Pacific during COVID-19 Pandemic-A Scoping Review","The impact of COVID-19 has forced higher education institutes to go into lockdown in order to curb the situation. This sudden change caused students within the institutions to forgo traditional face to face classroom settings and to attend immediate online classes. This review aims to summarize the evidence of the social demographic mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on students in higher education institutes within the Asia Pacific region and identify the coping mechanisms adopted during these times. A systematic literature search was conducted using three databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus), out of which 64 studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The findings revealed that the social demographic groups most at risk were female students, those who were in the final years of their studies (i.e., students who were almost graduating), and postgraduate students as well as students studying medical fields (nursing, dental, medicine, health sciences etc.). The majority of the studies identified that students were relying on mobile devices and extended screen time to cope with the pandemic. Having proper social support, be it through a network of friends or positive family cohesion, can be a good buffer against the mental impacts of COVID-19. Students in higher education institutes are at risk of mental consequences due to COVID-19. By reducing their screen time, finding a healthier coping system, increasing the availability of support within the family and community, as well as actively engaging in beneficial activities students may be able to alleviate general negative emotions, specifically during the pandemic.","Kaur, Balakrishnan, Chen, Periasamy","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19158894","20220728","Asia Pacific; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; higher education; mental health; stress; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35320,""

"Virtual training and technical assistance: a shift in behavioral health workforce access and perceptions of services during emergency restrictions","To respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-funded Technology Transfer Centers had to rapidly adapt to ensure that the behavioral health workforce had continuous access to remote training and technical assistance (TTA). Although the Technology Transfer Centers have historically relied partially upon virtual methods for delivering TTA, the shift to a strictly virtual approach necessitated by COVID-19 restrictions has raised new questions for how to best proceed with services when social distancing guidelines are relaxed. The objective of this exploratory paper was to compare TTA provision in the six-month period prior to (9/1/19 thru 2/28/20) and during (4/1/20 thru 9/30/20) early COVID-19 restrictions to determine the extent to which the shift to virtual service provision impacted the behavioral health and medical workforce. Specifically, we examined participants' access to TTA, geographic reach of TTA, and workforce perceptions of satisfaction and utility with TTA provision. Participant and event-level data were analyzed to compare the following metrics before and during the COVID pandemic: number of events and attendees; participant demographics; zip codes reached; coverage of rural, suburban, and urban areas; and perceptions of satisfaction with and utility of training. Findings showed a 40% increase in the number of events delivered (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and a 270% increase in the number of attendees (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) during the COVID period when TTCs relied exclusively on virtual delivery. Geospatial analyses linking zip codes to a schematic of rural, suburban, and urban classifications throughout the United States revealed significant increases in the number of zip codes reached during the COVID time period. Satisfaction levels were comparable before and during the pandemic. Findings show that expanded access to TTA services via virtual formats resulted in reach to more diverse attendees and regions, and did not come at the expense of satisfaction. Results suggest that virtual TTA should continue to be an important component of TTA offerings post-pandemic.","Powell, Chaple, Henry, Morton, Becker, Gotham, Hagle, Helle, Krom, Martin, Molfenter, Roget, Rutkowski, Velez-Echevarria, Yanez, Powell, Chaple, Henry, Morton, Becker, Gotham, Hagle, Helle, Krom, Martin, Molfenter, Roget, Rutkowski, Velez-Echevarria, Yanez","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03598-y","20220727","Behavioral health; COVID-19; Training; Workforce development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35322,""
"Factors influencing UK residents' preferences in how psychologists present themselves online: a conjoint analysis during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in mental health issues in the UK and worldwide, yet many UK residents have not received the help they have needed. Earlier research has indicated that accommodating client preferences leads to better therapeutic outcomes, however, little is known about preferences in how psychologists present themselves online and what might facilitate or slow help-seeking individuals' decision about whom to seek help from. Based on literature suggesting personal branding as an effective way for clients to choose between psychologists, we sought to investigate UK residents' preferences for specialization and self-disclosure in online presentations of psychologists based on level of fear of COVID-19 and diagnostic status. A sample of 187 UK residents were surveyed mid-April 2020 and analyzed using a rating-based conjoint analysis with a fractional factorial design consisting of 22 profiles. Each profile consisted of six attributes (Years of experience, area of expertise, gender, self-disclosure, training institution and facial trustworthiness). Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to explore preferences for area of expertise and self-disclosure depending on fear of COVID-19. An independent sample t-test was done to explore preference for self-disclosure among diagnosed residents. The conjoint model yielded a good fit (Kendall's tauÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.90, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Relative importance scores (RI) were highest for years of experience (RIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28.84) and area of expertise (RIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22.78). Residents with a high fear of COVID-19 preferred psychologists specialized in anxiety disorders and fear (also fear of COVID-19) more than residents with a low fear of COVID-19 (MDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.92, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[.198, 1.64], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.013). Residents with a high fear of COVID-19 also preferred self-disclosing psychologists more than residents with a low fear of COVID-19 (MDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.05, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[.184, 1.92], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.013). Diagnostic status was not associated with preference for self-disclosure. Listing de facto specialization in psychologist profiles might facilitate prospective clients' decision-making process. Self-disclosure appears to be important for some clients, but more research is warranted.","JÃƒÂ¸rgensen, Makransky","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08356-w","20220727","COVID-19 fear; Help-seeking; Mental health care marketing; Preferences; Private practitioner; Self-disclosure; Specialization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35323,""
"Hope During the COVID-19 Epidemic Decreased Anxiety and Depression Symptoms Mediated by Perceived Stress: Coping Style Differences Among Patients with COVID-19","This study aimed to investigate whether perceived stress mediated the relationship between hope and anxiety/depression symptoms among patients with COVID-19 during the epidemic. In addition, the potential moderating effect of coping styles was examined. From February 26 to March 10, 2020, patients with COVID-19 were asked to complete a questionnaire online, which included demographic characteristics, as well as the SCL-90-Anxiety, SCL-90-Depression, Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), Herth Hope Index (HHI), and Trait Coping Style Questionnaire (TCSQ). Hierarchical linear regression was performed to explore independent factors of anxiety/depression. A multi-group structural equation modeling with the collected data from patients in the Negative Coping style (NC) group and Positive Coping style (PC) group was used to test the hypothesized mechanism. In total, 382 valid questionnaires of patients were obtained, including 96 from NC patients and 286 from PC patients. In the hierarchical linear regression, hope and perceived stress were independent risk factors for both anxiety and depression in the total sample and PC group. However, hope was not independently related to anxiety/depression in the NC group. As hypothesized, the hope of patients had significant and negative indirect effects on both anxiety and depression that were mediated by perceived stress, However, the direct effect from stress on anxiety and depression was stronger for NC patients than for PC patients. Besides, hope had significant direct effects on anxiety/depression in PC patients, but not in NC patients. During the COVID-19 epidemic, perceived stress could mediate the relationship between hope and anxiety/depression symptoms among COVID-19 patients, with coping style moderating this cultivation process.","Wang, Liu, Xiao, Chen, Li, Yu, Ma, Song, Yang, Bai, Hou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11596-022-2624-2","20220727","COVID-19; anxiety; coping style; depression; hope; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35324,""

We foundÃ‚Â temporary reductions in all mental health consultations during lockdown in spring 2020. In fall 2020 and winter 2021, consultation volumes in primary care increased, stabilizing at a higher level in 2021. Consultations in specialist care increased from spring 2021. Our findings could suggest a worsening of mental health among adolescents.","Evensen, Hart, GodÃƒÂ¸y, Hauge, Lund, Knudsen, GrÃƒÂ¸tting, SurÃƒÂ©n, Reneflot","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02046-y","20220727","Adolescence; COVID-19; Children; Healthcare use; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35325,""

"Prenatal and postpartum maternal mental health and neonatal motor outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Rates of prenatal and postpartum stress and depression in pregnant individuals have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perinatal maternal mental health has been linked to worse motor development in offspring, with motor deficits appearing in infancy and early childhood. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between prenatal and postpartum stress and depression and motor outcome in infants born during the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and seventeen participants completed an online prospective survey study at two timepoints: during pregnancy and within 2 months postpartum. Depression was self-reported using the Edinburgh Perinatal/Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and stress via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Mothers reported total infant motor ability (fine and gross) using the interRAI 0-3 Developmental Domains questionnaire. Prenatal (EPDS median=10.0, interquartile range[IQR]=6.0 - 14.0, <i>B</i>=-0.035, 95%CI=-0.062 to -0.007, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.014) and postpartum maternal depression outcomes (median=7,Ã‚Â IQR=4-12, <i>B</i>=-0.037, 95%CI= -0.066 to -0.008, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.012) were significantlynegatively associated with total infant motor ability. Neither pregnancy nor postpartum perceived stress was associated with infant motor function. A cluster analysis revealed that preterm and low-birth weight infants whoseÃ‚Â mothers reported elevated depressive symptoms during pregnancy and in the postpartum period had the poorest motor outcomes. Prenatal and postpartum depression, but not stress, was associated with early infant motor abilities. Preterm and low-birth weight infants whose mothers reported elevated depressive symptoms maybe at-risk of experiencing poor motor outcomes. These results highlight the importance of identifying pre- and postnatal maternal mental health issues, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Papadopoulos, Nichols, Mohsenzadeh, Giroux, Mottola, Van Lieshout, Duerden","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100387","20220729","BSMSS, Barratt Simplified Measure of Social Status; COVID-19 depression; EPDS, Edinburgh Perinatal/Postnatal Depression Scale; Infant; PSS, Perceived Stress Scale; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-29","",35327,""
