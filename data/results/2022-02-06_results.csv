"Prevalence and correlates of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms among individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus during Ramadan fasting: A cross-sectional study in Bangladesh amid the COVID-19","Psychological concerns relating to ""diabetes distress"" (DD) and depressive symptoms (DS) in individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may negatively impact adherence to medical treatments and overall mental health. Thus, this study was undertaken to investigate DS and DD in relation to fasting during the month of Ramadan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 735 patients with T2DM in 2021. DD and DS were measured by the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Logistic regression and correlation analyses were executed. More than one-third of the participants (41.2%) had DD and DS (36.9%). DS was significantly higher in participants who did not fast (p=0.027). Participants who had higher dietary diversity were less likely to have DD (p=0.004) and DS (p=0.001). Females (AOR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.25-2.85) and those who lived alone (AOR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.25-2.85) were more likely to have DS. Participants with diabetes-related complications were more likely to experience DS (AOR= 2.17; 95% CI: 1.5-3.13) and DD (AOR= 3.46; 95% CI: 2.42-4.95). DD was also associated with being younger (p=0.003), having hypertension (p=0.030), having heart disease (p=0.012), and taking insulin (p=0.010). Individuals with T2DM who were not fasting experienced more mental health concerns. Psychosocial support and other interventions from health professionals should be examined and empirical interventions implemented to promote the mental health and well-being of individuals with T2DM.","Sultana, Islam, Sayeed, Potenza, Tajuddin Sikder, Aziz Rahman, Koly","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2022.109210","20220205","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Ramadan fasting; Type-2 diabetes mellitus; depressive symptoms; diabetes distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-06","",26607,""
"A qualitative analysis of perceptions of and reactions to COVID-19","To understand communities' perceptions, beliefs, and health-related behavior choices related to COVID-19 in order to guide public health nursing communication and interaction with patients and the community. A qualitative study, guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM), strove to comprehend the perceptions and reactions to COVID-19 among Wisconsinites. Twenty-five diverse Wisconsin residents aged 18 or older. Semi-structured interviews provided information about individuals' attitudes, perceptions, and reactions to COVID-19. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes. We identified three major themes: (1) ""health care starts way before you ever enter the doors of a healthcare facility""; (2) ""to live in a society is to help each other""; and (3) mental health as impacted by COVID-19. This study demonstrated the need for greater public health support, as well as the role of Social Determinants of Health. Understanding perceptions and reactions to COVID-19 can help public health nurses understand and better respond to future pandemics.","Hawkins, Lopez, Schmitt, Tamkin, Dressel, Kako, Mkandawire-Valhmu, Weinhardt","https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.13052","20220205","COVID-19 reactions; Wisconsin; pandemic response; public health nursing; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-06","",26608,""

"Impact of housing conditions on changes in youth's mental health following the initial national COVID-19 lockdown: a cohort study","We aimed to investigate if declines in youth's mental health during lockdown were dependent on housing condition among 7445 youth (median ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°20Ã‚Â years) from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), with data collected at 18Ã‚Â years of age and again three weeks into the first national lockdown (April 2020). We examined associations between housing conditions (access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition) and changes in mental health (mental well-being, Quality of Life (QoL) and loneliness). We report results from multivariate linear and logistic regression models. Youth without access to outdoor spaces experienced greater declines in mental well-being (vs. garden; mean difference: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0Ã‚Â·75 (95% CI -Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â·14, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0Ã‚Â·36)), and correspondingly greater odds of onset ofÃ‚Â low mental well-being (vs. garden; OR: 1Ã‚Â·72 (95% CI 1Ã‚Â·20, 2Ã‚Â·48)).

"Differential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health Symptoms and Working Conditions for Senior and Junior Doctors in Australian Hospitals","This study investigated severity, prevalence, and predictors of workplace disruption and mental health symptoms in Australian junior and senior hospital medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey collected data on demographics, workplace disruption, personal relationships, and mental health. One thousand twenty-one (62.1%) senior and 745 (37.9%) junior medical staff, located primarily in Victoria, completed the survey. Work disruptions were common but varied by seniority, with junior staff more frequently exposed to COVID-19 (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout were common but significantly higher in junior doctors (PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.011 to &lt;0.001). Common predictors for experiencing mental health symptoms were identified, including prior mental health diagnoses and worsening personal relationships. COVID-19 has had significant but varied impacts on junior and senior doctors, with junior doctors particularly susceptible to harm to mental health.

"Cutting Edge: Serum but Not Mucosal Antibody Responses Are Associated with Pre-Existing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Cross-Reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells following BNT162b2 Vaccination in the Elderly","Advanced age is a main risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, low vaccination efficacy and accelerated waning immunity have been reported in this age group. To elucidate age-related differences in immunogenicity, we analyzed human cellular, serological, and salivary SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-specific immune responses to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in old (69-92 y) and middle-aged (24-57 y) vaccinees compared with natural infection (COVID-19 convalescents, 21-55 y of age). Serological humoral responses to vaccination excee-ded those of convalescents, but salivary anti-spike subunit 1 (S1) IgA and neutralizing capacity were less durable in vaccinees. In old vaccinees, we observed that pre-existing spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are associated with efficient induction of anti-S1 IgG and neutralizing capacity in serum but not saliva. Our results suggest pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as a predictor of an efficient COVID-19 vaccine-induced humoral immune response in old individuals.","Meyer-Arndt, Schwarz, Loyal, Henze, Kruse, Dingeldey, GÃƒÂ¼rcan, Uyar-Aydin, MÃƒÂ¼ller, Drosten, Paul, Sander, Demuth, Lauster, Giesecke-Thiel, Braun, Corman, Thiel","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100990","20220205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-06","",26612,""

Prospective cross-sectional survey study. Online international survey. Single-best, open box and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questions. The survey was sent to 35 509 HCPs in 124 countries and was open from 7 to 21 May 2020. 2237/3237 (69.1%) HCPs from 115 countries who consented to participate completed the survey. 1058 (47.3%) completed the HADS. Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, depression and anxiety among HCPs in relation to country and PPE availability. Univariate analyses were used to investigate associations without generating erroneous causal conclusions. Confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 13.0%. PPE provision concerns were raised by 74.1% of participants; highest among trainees/resident physicians (83.9%) and among HCPs in Spain (89.7%). Most participants worked in self-perceived high-risk areas with SARS-CoV-2 (67.5%-87.0%), with proportionately more trainees interacting with suspected/confirmed infected patients (57.1% vs 24.2%-40.6%) and sonographers seeing more patients who did not wear a mask (33.3% vs 13.9%-7.9%). The most frequent PPE combination used was gloves and a surgical mask (22.3%). UK and US respondents reported spending less time self-isolating (8.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°days) and lower satisfaction with their national pandemic response (37.0%-43.0%). 19.8% and 8.8% of respondents met the criteria for moderate to severe anxiety and depression, respectively. Reported prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCPs is consistent with literature findings. Most respondents used gloves and a surgical mask, with a greater SARS-CoV-2 prevalence compared with those using 'full' PPE. HCPs with the least agency (trainees and sonographers) were not only more likely to see high-risk patients but also less likely to be protected.

In children and adolescents, serious risks due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are also related to its indirect effects. These include an unbalanced diet with an increased risk of weight excess or nutritional deficiencies, increased sedentary lifestyle, lack of schooling, social isolation, and impaired mental health.Pediatricians should be aware of the side effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's diet, physical mental health and advise the families according to their nutritional needs and financial resources. Moreover, the lack of a targeted therapy able to offer protection against the deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection should require a greater effort by scientific societies to find a more effective prevention strategy.

"Implementation of a nurse-led overdose prevention site in a hospital setting: lessons learned from St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada","In May 2018, St. Paul's Hospital (SPH) in Vancouver (Canada) opened an outdoor peer-led overdose prevention site (OPS) operated in partnership with Vancouver Coastal Health and RainCity Housing. At the end of 2020, the partnered OPS moved to a new location, which created a gap in service for SPH inpatients and outpatients. To address this gap, which was magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, SPH opened a nurse-led OPS in February 2021. This paper describes the steps leading to the implementation of the nurse-led OPS, its impact, and lessons learned. Four steps paved the way for the opening of the OPS: (1) identifying the problem, (2) seeking ethics guidance, (3) adapting policies and practices, and (4) supporting and training staff. The OPS is open between 10:00 and 20:00 and staffed by two nurses per shift. It is accessible to all patients including inpatients, patients in the Emergency Department, and patients attending outpatient services. Between February 1, 2021 and October 23, 2021, the OPS recorded 1612 visits for the purpose of injection, for an average weekly visit number of 42. A total of 46 overdoses were recorded in that 9-month period. Thirty-seven (80%) required administration of naloxone and 12 (26%) required a code blue response. Due to the unique nature of our OPS, we learned many important lessons in the process leading to the opening of the site and the months that followed. We conclude the paper with lessons learned grouped into six main categories, namely engagement, communication, access, staff education and support, data collection, and safety.","Dogherty, Patterson, Gagnon, Harrison, Chase, Boerstler, Gibson, Gill, Nolan, Ryan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00596-7","20220205","Addiction; Harm reduction; Hospital; Injection drug use; Overdose; Overdose prevention; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-06","",26616,""
"COVID-19, sex, and gender in China: a scoping review","During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, states were called upon by the World Health Organization to introduce and prioritise the collection of sex-disaggregated data. The collection of sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 testing, infection rates, hospital admissions, and deaths, when available, has informed our understanding of the biology of the infectious disease. The collection of sex-disaggregated data should also better inform our understanding of the gendered impacts that contribute to risk of exposure to COVID-19. In China, the country with the longest history of fighting the COVID-19 infection, what research was available on the gender-differential impacts of COVID-19 in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic? In this scoping review, we examine the first 6 months (January-June 2020) of peer-reviewed publications (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°451) on sex and gender experiences related to COVID-19 in China. We conducted an exhaustive search of published Chinese and English language research papers on COVID-19 in mainland China. We used a COVID-19 Gender Matrix informed by the JPHIEGO gender analysis toolkit to examine and illuminate research into the gendered impacts of COVID-19 within China. In China, only a small portion of the COVID-19-related research focused on gender experiences and differences. Near the end of the six-month literature review period, a small number of research items emerged on women healthcare workers, women's mental health, and pregnant women's access to care. There was an absence of research on the gendered impact of COVID-19 amongst populations. There was minimal consideration of the economic, social and security factors, including gender stereotypes and expectations, that affected different populations' experiences of infection, treatment, and lockdown during the period of review. At the outset of health emergencies in China, gender research needs to be prioritised during the first stage of an outbreak to assist with evaluation of the most effective public health measures, identifying access to healthcare and social welfare barriers amongst priority communities. Gender stereotypes and gendered differences lead to different patterns of exposure and treatment.

"The Bronze Age of drug checking:Ã‚Â barriers and facilitators to implementingÃ‚Â advanced drug checking amidst police violence and COVID-19","Unpredictable fluctuations in the illicit drug market increase overdose risk. Drug checking, or the use of technology to provide insight into the contents of illicit drug products, is an overdose prevention strategy with an emerging evidence base. The use of portable spectrometry devices to provide point-of-service analysis of the contents of illicit drugs been adopted by harm reduction organizations internationally but is only emerging in the United States. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators of implementing drug checking services with spectrometry devices in an urban harm reduction organization and syringe service program serving economically marginalized people who use drugs in Boston, Massachusetts (USA). In-vivo observations and semi-structured interviews with harm reduction staff and participants were conducted between March 2019 and December 2020. We used the consolidated framework for implementation research to identify implementation barriers and facilitators. This implementation effort was facilitated by the organization's shared culture of harm reduction-which fostered shared implementation goals and beliefs about the intervention among staff persons-its horizontal organizational structure, strong identification with the organization among staff, and strong relationships with external funders. Barriers to implementation included the technological complexity of the advanced spectroscopy devices utilized for drug checking. Program staff indicated that commercially available spectroscopy devices are powerful but not always well-suited for drug checking efforts, describing their technological capacities as ""the Bronze Age of Drug Checking."" Other significant barriers include the legal ambiguity of drug checking services, disruptive and oppositional police activity, and the responses and programmatic changes demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic. For harm reduction organizations to be successful in efforts to implement and scale drug checking services, these critical barriers-especially regressive policing policies and prohibitive costs-need to be addressed. Future research on the impact of policy changes to reduce the criminalization of substance use or to provide explicit legal frameworks for the provision of this and other harm reduction services may be merited.","Carroll, Mackin, Schmidt, McKenzie, Green","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00590-z","20220205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-06","",26618,""
"Increases in drug overdose deaths in Norway and the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","Little international comparative work exists describing pandemic-related spikes in overdose and related implications for drug and public health policy. We compared increases in overdose deaths during the pandemic in Norway and the United States, two countries in the top 10 for per-capita overdose mortality, yet with very different approaches to the pandemic, healthcare and drug policy. We examined monthly overdoses in 2020 versus baseline rates (the monthly average across 2017-2019). We compared excess overdose mortality to shifts in human mobility and social interaction, measured using cellphone-based mobility data, an indicator of the societal response to the pandemic. Both the US and Norway saw large magnitude exacerbations in overdose mortality during the pandemic-related lockdowns, reaching 46.8% and 57.0% above baseline, respectively. Maximum increases occurred 2-3 months after peak reductions in mobility, suggesting lagged mechanisms. While overdose mortality returned to baseline relatively quickly in Norway, rates remained elevated in the US to the end of 2020. <b>Spikes in overdose mortality in both contexts may relate to disruptions in healthcare access and the drug supply becoming more potent. Norway's quicker return to baseline may reflect more robust access to harm reduction and addiction-related healthcare services. Nevertheless, it is notable that even in Norway - with universal access to high-quality services, low COVID-19 rates, and a highly effective public health infrastructure - a greater than 50% spike in overdose deaths was still seen at the onset of lockdown measures. This may have important implications for future pandemic and disaster planning.</b>","Friedman, Gjersing","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948221075025","20220205","COVID-19 pandemic; Drug overdose mortality; Norway; United States; comparative; human mobility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-06","",26619,""
