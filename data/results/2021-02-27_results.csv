Objectives: This study aimed to examine the health status, occupational burnout, and stress of caring for patients with highly infectious diseases among health care organization employees in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate whether their experiences were associated with having previous experience with SARS  Methods: In this cross-sectional study, employees aged 20 and older who had a service period of 3 months or longer at a medical center in northern Taiwan were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey  The questionnaire comprised physical and mental health scales, the Occupational Burnout Inventory, the Stress Scale of Caring for Highly Infectious Disease Patients (only required for medical personnel), and questions regarding basic demographic information  Differences between participants with and without SARS experience were examined using t tests  Results: Two hundred twenty-four participants completed the questionnaire, and among them, 77 5% were women, 36 2% were in the age group 20-30 years, and 19 2% were frontline staff during the 2003 SARS outbreak  The mean scores on mental and physical health scales were 11 74 Â± (2 87 standard deviation [SD]) and 11 16 Â± (3 13 [SD]), respectively  The mean scores for the four dimensions of the Occupational Burnout Inventory and the Stress Scale of Caring for Highly Infectious Disease Patients ranged from 33 02 to 45 89 and 9 35 to 12 89, respectively  Participants who had experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak had significantly higher scores than those who had not in the three dimensions of occupational burnout-namely personal burnout, work-related burnout, and overcommitment to work-and in the dimensions relating to the stress of caring for patients with highly infectious diseases, including discomfort caused by protective equipment, difficulties and anxiety regarding infection control, and patient care workload, as well as higher total scores  Conclusion: Our findings suggest that health care workers who experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak had higher levels of occupational burnout and stress when caring for patients with highly infectious diseases in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic than colleagues without such experience","<U+9B4F><U+82B3><U+541B>, <U+674E><U+6021><U+65FB>, <U+8B1D><U+8559><U+5B9C>, <U+9EC3><U+5A49><U+7FE0>,

"HOW CAN PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PSYCHIATRISTS HELP COVID-19 BEREAVED PERSONS: FIVE PROPOSITIONS TO UNDERSTANDING CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGES","The COVID-19 pandemic is causing unprecedented cumulative deaths and leaving behind millions of bereaved families and individuals  Moreover, the pandemic is disrupting social fabrics in the conventional way we mourn our deads  In this context therefore, how can psychologists, psychiatrists and other health care professionals help bereaved families and individuals more effectively? This opinion paper proposed five recommendations that cover mental health care needs and challenges which may emerge from the management of these traumatic deaths  In all, efforts to comply with either DSM-5 or ICD-11 PGD guidelines could help COVID-19 bereaved persons with overwhelming distress, as they ensure therapists' use of appropriate terminologies in therapeutic alliances  However, clinicians need to have a global perspective of COVID-19 bereavement courses, political and public health measures due to the pandemic, and flexible attitudes about the ICD-11 and of DSM-5 time-criterion for diagnosis  This paper emphasizes the importance of social and collective recognition of COVID-19 deaths through various symbolic and materialized forms to free up collective and individual capacities for resilience  The necessity of individual and group interventions through online platforms is underscored, however these modes of therapies may not reinforce social inequalities by excluding bereaved individuals who really need them","Kokou-Kpolou, C.

"KAP-COVID<sub>GLOBAL</sub>: a multinational survey of the levels and determinants of public knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19","OBJECTIVE: The adherence to public health recommendations to control COVID-19 spread is influenced by public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.24Â±3.59) and attitudes (3.72Â±2.31) and good practices (12.12Â±1.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed. Future awareness efforts should target less advantaged groups and future studies should develop new strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative mental health effects.","Masoud, Ahmed Taher; Zaazouee, Mohamed Sayed; Elsayed, Sarah Makram; Ragab, Khaled Mohamed; Kamal, Esraa M; Alnasser, Yusra T; Assar, Ahmed; Nourelden, Anas Z; Istatiah, Loai J; Abd-Elgawad, Mohamed M; Abdelsattar, Ahmed T; Sofy, Ahmed A; Hegazy, Doaa G; FemÃ­a, Victor Z; MendonÃ§a, Adriana R; Sayed, Fatma M; Elmoursi, Ahmed; Alareidi, Alaa; Abd-Eltawab, Ahmed K; Abdelmonem, Mohamed; Mohammed, Omar M; Derballa, EzzEldeen A; El-Fas, Kareem A; Abdel-Daim, Mohamed M; Abushouk, Abdelrahman I","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043971","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(2): e043971, 2021 02 23.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(2): e043971, 2021 02 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11276,""
"Interventions to address mental health issues in healthcare workers during infectious disease outbreaks: A systematic review","Considering the importance of evidence on interventions to tackle mental health problems in healthcare workers (HCWs) during pandemics, we conducted a systematic review, aiming to identify and summarize the implemented interventions to deal with mental health issues of HCWs during infectious disease outbreaks and report their effectiveness. Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, CINAHL and PsycInfo electronic databases were searched until October 2nd, 2020. Primary-data articles, describing any implemented interventions and their effectiveness were considered pertinent. Studies were screened according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and subsequently data extraction was performed. Twenty-four articles, referring to SARS, Ebola, Influenza AH1N1 and COVID-19 were included. Interventions addressing mental health issues in HCWs during pandemics/epidemics were grouped into four categories: 1) informational support (training, guidelines, prevention programs), 2) instrumental support (personal protective equipment, protection protocols); 3) organizational support (manpower allocation, working hours, re-organization of facilities/structures, provision of rest areas); 4) emotional and psychological support (psychoeducation and training, mental health support team, peer-support and counselling, therapy, digital platforms and tele-support). These results might be helpful for researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers to develop evidence-based sustainable interventions and guidelines, aiming to prevent or reduce the immediate and long-term effect of pandemics on mental health status of HCWs.","ZaÃƒÂ§e, Hoxhaj, Orfino, Viteritti, Janiri, Di Pietro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.019","20210226","Epidemic; Healthcare workers; Interventions; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11277,""
"The COVID-19 outbreak and PNES: The impact of a ubiquitously felt stressor","We aimed to assess frequency of functional seizures or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) during the COVID-19 outbreak and to recognize possible factors associated with worsening in this population. In this cross-sectional study conducted during the second phase of the pandemic, adult patients with PNES documented by video-EEG and followed up in two tertiary epilepsy centers responded to a structured telephone survey. Data were gathered on demographics, clinical features and frequency of PNES, history of psychiatric comorbidity, access to treatment, as well as on anxiety (GAD-7 items) and depressive symptoms (NDDI-E). Fifty-four patients (78% female; mean age of 31.36Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years [SDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯10.6]) were contacted and 15 (28%) reported increased frequency of PNES during the pandemic. Higher scores of GAD-7 items (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) and NDDI-E (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) were associated with PNES worsening. There was strong evidence of a correlation between higher stress levels (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001) and poor sleep quality (p 0.005) with PNES aggravation. After regression, stress was the strongest predictor of PNES increased frequency. Patients with functional neurological disorders are vulnerable during ubiquitously felt stressors. However, the atmosphere of uncertainty did not affect these patients equally. Patients with PNES showing symptoms of anxiety and depression are at higher risk of seizure worsening. Early identification of this subset of patients may prevent this detrimental outcome.","Valente, Alessi, Baroni, Marin, Dos Santos, Palmini","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107852","20210226","Acute stress disorder; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Functional seizures; Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11278,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of adults in South Korea","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant challenges to nations. The Korean government aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through stay-at-home strategies and maintaining social distance, which are likely to result in major changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of citizens. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these factors in Koreans over 20 years old. The study sample consisted of 104 adults in South Korea aged over 20 years. An online survey was conducted between August and October 2020, in which participants were asked to complete the Yonsei Lifestyle Profile to assess lifestyle changes, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale abbreviated version. To investigate the changes in people's lifestyles, depression, and quality of life post COVID-19, descriptive statistics were calculated for these indicators before and after the onset of the pandemic. The p-value was two-sided, and values &lt;0.05, were regarded as statistically significant. There was a significant decline in physical and other meaningful activities, including activities of daily living, leisure, social activity, and education. However, there were no significant changes in nutrition, except in the consumption of carbohydrates and minerals. Participants reported that their quality of life and mental health had decreased after the pandemic struck. We obtained novel data on the changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of South Korean adults before and after the onset of the pandemic. The results of our study may assist health policymakers and practitioners in the development of health education or relevant interventions to deal with the pandemic situation as well as future crises.","Park, Kim, Yang, Lim, Park","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247970","20210226","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11279,""

To date, most interventions intended to promote well-being have focused on individual strategies rather than environmental drivers of distress, and the primary offerings have comprised strategies such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, nutrition, exercise, and sleep. Responses to this programming from medical learners have primarily ranged from ambivalence to resentment, with many feeling that the programming failed to adequately address their particular needs and the challenges they were experiencing. In this commentary, the author challenges the assumption that well-being per se should be the ideal target or goal. Learners and faculty may be better served by considering other goals-those that do not focus directly on well-being, but that are instead foundational for well-being in that they directly address the challenges that students, residents, and faculty are facing. In other words, goals and associated interventions would focus on the experience of school and work, rather than focusing primarily on encouraging healthy practices outside of school and work. The author proposes using the lens of satisfaction through which to view and assess progress toward well-being, increasing satisfaction within 3 interconnected domains: (1) school and/or work, (2) self, and (3) life. Attention to these domains may be more likely to produce improvements in well-being that have been sought for years, but that remain elusive.","Slavin","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004023","20210226","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11280,""
"An Impact Evaluation protocol for the rapid design and delivery of an experience-based co-designed mobile app to support the mental health needs of healthcare workers impacted by COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the central importance of health care workers' (HCWs) mental health and wellbeing for the successful function of the health care system. Few targeted digital tools exist to support hospital HCWs' mental health and none appear to have been led and co-designed by HCWs. RMHive is being led and developed by HCWs as a mobile app to support the mental health challenges being posed by COVID-19 to HCWs using experience-based co-design (EBCD) processes. We present the Impact Evaluation protocol for the rapid design and delivery of the RMHive mobile app. The Impact Evaluation adopts a mixed-method design. Qualitative data from photo interviews undertaken with up to 30 HCWs exploring needs and experiences, and semi-structured interviews conducted with up to 30 governance stakeholders will be integrated with qualitative and quantitative user analytics data (using Think Aloud methods) and user generated demographic and mental health data entered into the app. Analyses will address three evaluation questions related to: (1) engagement with and use of the mobile app; (2) implementation and integration of the app; and (3) the quantifiable and qualitative impacts on individual mental health outcomes. The mobile app design and development will be described using the mobile health (mHealth) evidence reporting and assessment (mERA) guidelines. Implementation of the app will be evaluated using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) as a framework to analyse qualitative data from interviews combined with text and video analysis from semi-structured interviews using a Think Aloud approach. Mental health impacts will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ4) total score and subscale scores for the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ2) for depression and Generalised Anxiety Scale (GAD2) for anxiety. The PHQ4 will be completed at download (baseline), then at 14 and 28 days. The anticipated use period of the app is an average of 30 days. The rapid design will occur over four months using EBCD to collect qualitative data and develop app content. The Impact Evaluation will monitor outcome data for up to 12 weeks following the Minimal Viable Product release hospital wide for all health care workers to use. The study received funding and institutional ethics approvals in June, 2020. Outcome data is expected to be available in March 2021 and the Impact Evaluation published mid-2021. The Impact Evaluation will examine the rapid design, development and implementation of the RMHive app and its impact on the mental health outcomes for HCWs. Findings from the Impact Evaluation will provide guidance for the integration of EBCD in rapid design and implementation processes. The Evaluation will also inform the future development and roll out of the app to support the mental health needs of hospital based HCWs more widely.  <AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">DERR1-10.2196/26168.","Lewis, Palmer, Kotevski, Densley, O'Donnell, Johnson, Wohlgezogen, Gray, Robins-Browne, Burchill","https://doi.org/10.2196/26168","20210226","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11281,""
"Mental health of individuals who are deaf during COVID-19: Depression, anxiety, aggression, and fear","This study aims to assess depression and anxiety levels among individuals, who are deaf during the lockdown throughout the first wave of the pandemic United Arab Emirates. The sample of the study consisted of 36 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36) individuals aged 20.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2 years, who were deaf from birth. The respondents were divided into two groups; (1) those who were living with their parents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20), (2) those who were independently living on their own (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16). Results of the study indicated that from May to October, there was decrease in the number of normal mental health cases among those living with parents (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The results of the study show that in the time of the pandemic, deaf people constitute a vulnerable portion of the population. The correlation between living alone and stress levels was 0.78.

"Population-level impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on breast cancer screening and diagnostic procedures","To understand how health care delays may affect breast cancer detection, the authors quantified changes in breast-related preventive and diagnostic care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Eligible women (N = 39,444) were aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years and received a screening mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, or breast biopsy between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020, at 7 academic and community breast imaging facilities in North Carolina. Changes in the number of mammography or breast biopsy examinations after March 3, 2020 (the first COVID-19 diagnosis in North Carolina) were evaluated and compared with the expected numbers based on trends between January 1, 2019 and March 2, 2020. Changes in the predicted mean monthly number of examinations were estimated using interrupted time series models. Differences in patient characteristics were tested using least squares means regression. Fewer examinations than expected were received after the pandemic's onset. Maximum reductions occurred in March 2020 for screening mammography (-85.1%; 95% CI, -100.0%, -70.0%) and diagnostic mammography (-48.9%; 95% CI, -71.7%, -26.2%) and in May 2020 for biopsies (-40.9%; 95% CI, -57.6%, -24.3%). The deficit decreased gradually, with no significant difference between observed and expected numbers by July 2020 (diagnostic mammography) and August 2020 (screening mammography and biopsy). Several months after the pandemic's onset, women who were receiving care had higher predicted breast cancer risk (screening mammography, P &lt; .001) and more commonly lacked insurance (diagnostic mammography, P &lt; .001; biopsy, P &lt; .001) compared with the prepandemic population. Pandemic-associated deficits in the number of breast examinations decreased over time. Utilization differed by breast cancer risk and insurance status, but not by age or race/ethnicity. Long-term studies are needed to clarify the contribution of these trends to breast cancer disparities.","Nyante, Benefield, Kuzmiak, Earnhardt, Pritchard, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33460","20210226","biopsy; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); interrupted time series analysis; mammography; screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11283,""
"Depression and anxiety in cancer patients before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: association with treatment delays","Pandemics can be associated with anxiety and depression in cancer patients who are undergoing treatment. In the present study, we aimed to perform a comparative evaluation of the conditions of cancer patients before and during the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to detect the impact of the pandemic on treatment delays that are associated with anxiety and depression in cancer patients. In addition, the effect of public transport use on treatment delays was examined. BDI and BAI were administered to 595 breast, ovarian, colon and gastric cancer patients before and during the pandemic. The questionnaires were administered by the physician blindly, who was unaware of the delay of the patients. The number of days by which the patients delayed their treatment due to the fear of contamination were recorded retrospectively. Correlation analyses were performed between the obtained scores and treatment delays. The depression and anxiety levels in cancer patients were found to increase during the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000), and this increase was positively correlated with the disruption of their treatment (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000, rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.81). Depression and anxiety levels and treatment delays were higher in elderly patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021). Depression and anxiety were more pronounced in female patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000). Moreover, treatment delays were more common in patients who had to use public transportation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.038). SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may increase anxiety and depression in cancer patients. This can cause patients to experience treatment delays due to concerns about becoming infected. At this point, if necessary, assistance should be obtained from psychiatric and public health experts.","Yildirim, Poyraz, Erdur","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-02795-4","20210226","Anxiety; Cancer patients; Depression; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11284,""
"COVID-19, Moral Injury and the Bhagvad Gita","During life challenging times like the present COVID-19 pandemic, the health care worker (HCW) is faced with a number of questions of an existential nature. There is a sense of guilt, anguish, helplessness, uncertainty and powerlessness when one is fighting something on such a powerful scale with limited resources and no definite end in sight. There are circumstances when these feelings can overwhelm a person leading to demoralization and potentially a moral injury. Spiritual practices and advice may help to deal with moral paradoxes and ethical dilemmas when other secular supports are undermined or inaccessible. The Holy Indian Epic, the Bhagvad Gita has described the moral distress of the warrior Arjuna, during the battle of Kurukshetra and the advice given to him by the Lord Krishna the gist of which can be encapsulated in the form of the four Ds- Detachment, Duty, Doer-ship and Dhyana or meditation. In this article, the authors explore how these concepts may be useful aids to the HCW faced with moral and psychological distress.","Menon, Narayan, Bhade","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01210-z","20210226","COVID-19Ã‚Â and health care; HinduÃ‚Â philosophy; The Bhagvad Gita","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11285,""

In the quantitative phase, 23 participants answered a survey before and during COVID-19, assessing work-status, mental health, and work-related psychological need satisfaction. The qualitative phase included interviews with ten employed participants. Results indicate a significant decrease in mental health of participants who lost their jobs during COVID-19, while participants who continued to physically attend work, maintained pre-COVID-19 levels on all assessed variables. Participants who transitioned to remote-work from home, showed a marginally significant deterioration in mental health and a significant decrease in satisfaction of work-related psychological needs for competence and autonomy. Qualitative accounts supplement these findings and portray advantages and disadvantages of remote-work.","Goldfarb, Gal, Golan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-04902-3","20210226","Autistic adults; COVID-19; Employment; Self-determination theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11286,""
"Compassion fatigue of funeral directors during and after the first wave of COVID-19","Compassion fatigue has not been studied among funeral directors. Yet, funeral directors have been exposed to the same risks for compassion fatigue as other caregivers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An online survey was spread two times to 287 employees of funeral home DELA, in Belgium. Once during the height of the first wave of COVID-19 in Belgium, and a second time at the end of the first wave. The professional quality of life-scale 5 (PROQOL-5) was used to measure compassion fatigue, which includes burnout, compassion satisfaction and secondary trauma. Non-parametric tests were performed. In total, 104 participants answered the first survey, and 107 the second. Burnout increases from survey 1 to survey 2 (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), while compassion satisfaction (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011) and secondary trauma decrease (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). In survey 1, only age (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.007) and gender (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.040) were found to be significantly associated with secondary trauma. In survey 2, having more work experience is associated with having a higher burnout (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.008) and secondary trauma (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001) score. Neither for burnout (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), nor for secondary trauma (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) are there any respondents in the highest category. Although overall funeral directors do not have acute problems with compassion fatigue, burnout scores increase significantly after the first wave.","Van Overmeire, Van Keer, Cocquyt, Bilsen","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab030","20210226","mental health; screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11287,""
"Improving Mood Through Community Connection and Resources Using an Interactive Digital Platform: Development and Usability Study","COVID-19 continues to disrupt global health and well-being. In April-May 2020, we generated a digital, remote interactive tool to provide health and well-being resources and foster connectivity among community members through a text messaging platform. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the ability of a health system-based digital, remote, interactive tool to provide health and well-being resources to local community participants and to foster connectivity among them during the early phases of COVID-19. We performed descriptive and nonparametric longitudinal statistical analyses to describe and compare the participants' mood ratings over time and thematic analysis of their responses to text messages to further assess mood. From among 393 individuals seeking care in an urban emergency department in an academic setting, engaged in a two-way text messaging platform, we recorded 287 mood ratings and 368 qualitative responses. We observed no difference in the initial mood rating by week of enrollment [Kruskal-Wallis chi-square H(5)=1.34; P=.93], and the average mood rating did not change for participants taken together [Friedman chi-square Q(3)=0.32; P=.96]. However, of participants providing mood ratings at baseline, mood improved significantly among participants who reported a low mood rating at baseline [n=25, 14.97%; Q(3)=20.68; P&lt;.001] but remained stable among those who reported a high mood rating at baseline [n=142, 85.03%; Q(3)=2.84; P=.42]. Positive mood elaborations most frequently included words related to sentiments of thankfulness and gratitude, mostly for a sense of connection and communication; in contrast, negative mood elaborations most frequently included words related to anxiety. Our findings suggest the feasibility of engaging individuals in a digital community with an emergency department facilitation. Specifically, for those who opt to engage in a text messaging platform during COVID-19, it is feasible to assess and respond to mood-related queries with vetted health and well-being resources.","Ortiz, Southwick, Schneider, Klinger, Pelullo, Guntuku, Merchant, Agarwal","https://doi.org/10.2196/25834","20210226","COVID-19; community; digital health; digital tool; mental health; mood; prospective; thematic analysis; virtual support; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11288,""
"Public Messaging for Serious Illness Care in the Age of Coronavirus Disease: Cutting through Misconceptions, Mixed Feelings, and Distrust","A year ago, we began a project designed to align public messages from 10 organizations involved in advance care planning (ACP), palliative care (PC), and hospice to increase public engagement. By public messaging, we are referring to a well-established evidence-driven method of disseminating information at scale that enables the public to take action to protect their health. Our project plan was upended by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-but we used the opportunity to conduct focus groups during the pandemic that, compared with focus groups conducted before the pandemic, provide an important portrait of public perceptions of serious illness care that can be used to design for greater public engagement. Our findings can be summarized in three observations. First, misunderstanding of ACP, PC, and hospice is wide ranging and deep. Second, COVID-19 evokes its own brand of confusion and ambivalence that is distinct from other serious illnesses. And third, distrust of the health care system has become the new normal. Despite these findings, our focus group participants strongly endorsed five messaging principles (1) talk up the benefits, (2) present choices for every step, (3) use stories that are positive and aspirational, (4) invite dialogue-more than once, and (5) invoke a new team-of people who matter, clinicians, medical institutions, and community organizations who are ready to help. After listening to 100-word stories describing real patient experiences with ACP, PC, and hospice, our focus group participants expressed interest and appreciation. But to improve public engagement broadly, we need to explain our work to the general public in a way that makes them want to know more.","Back, Grant, McCabe","https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0719","20210226","COVID-19; advance care planning; hospice; messaging; palliative; public; serious illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11289,""
"Treatment of catatonia with asenapine in a patient with schizotypal personality disorder, psychotic depression and septic shock from SARS-CoV-2 - A case report","Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome that presents with severe symptoms which can lead to dangerous and lethal conditions if not diagnosed and treated properly. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that can occur in severe cases with acute pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. In these cases, ICU admission is necessary. A 59-year-old Caucasian man with septic shock and bilateral interstitial pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 and schizotypal personality disorder presented with catatonic behaviour manifested by soporous state, response to intense painful stimuli with opening of the eyes, execution of simple verbal commands, maintenance of the same position, catalepsy, immobility, rigidity and mutism. At the same time, there were symptoms of septic shock and catatonic symptoms causing greater difficulty in the correct formulation of the diagnosis. During the course of his hospitalization, he was treated with asenapine 20 mg/day. The catatonia responded rapidly and significantly to the asenapine. To date, the pathophysiology of catatonia is unclear and few guidelines are available for the treatment of catatonia. In the literature, studies have reported the efficacy of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam, GABAA agonists such as zolpidem, NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, antidepressant SSRIs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine and antipsychotics such as olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole. We demonstrate that the antipsychotic asenapine is also effective in treating catatonic symptoms in psychiatric disorders. Asenapine produced a rapid and significant reduction in catatonic symptoms in our patient with schizotypal personality disorder.","FiaschÃƒÂ¨, Adriani, Mancinelli, Taranto","https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527320666210226114238","20210226","asenapine ; catatonia ; catatonic symptoms ; sars-cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11290,""
"Mental Health of Physicians During COVID-19 Outbreak in Bangladesh: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Survey","There have been numerous studies about the health implication of COVID-19 on patients, but little attention has been paid to the impacts of the pandemic on physicians. Our paper attends to this gap by exploring the mental health of physicians in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly important since the mental health of physicians impacts not only on themselves, but also their professional performance and hence the care of patients. This study examined physicians' mental health outcomes by evaluating the prevalence and associated potential risk factors of anxiety and depression. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 114 physicians. Seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure the anxiety and depression, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the potential risk factors related to anxiety and depression. The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 32.5 and 34.2%, respectively. Findings revealed that marital status, work per day and current job location were the main risk factors for anxiety while sex, age, and marital status were the main risk factors for depression. Our results highlight the need to implement policies and strategies for positively impacting the mental health of physicians during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khatun, Parvin, Rashid, Alam, Kamrunnahar, Talukder, Rahman Razu, Ward, Ali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.592058","20210226","Bangladesh; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11291,""

"The Benefits and Risks of the Provision of a Hospital-Wide High-Definition Video Conferencing Virtual Visiting Service for Patients and Their Relatives","Background Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, virtual visiting (VV) has become important because of visiting restrictions in hospitals. This project aimed to determine the impact of VV on staff and patients' loved ones (visitors). Methodology VV is defined as high-resolution video communication between admitted COVID-19 patients and their loved ones in the presence of a staff member using a healthcare platform.Ã‚Â VV was introduced in a 419-bedded hospital in the UK in April 2020.Ã‚Â Qualitative data on the VV experience were collected from relatives and staff via an open feedback email address and reflective practice. Data were entered and analyzed in person by two independent assessors. Grounded theory methodology and thematic analysis were used to draw conclusions. Results Between April 16, 2020 and November 30, 2020, 1,009 visits were delivered. There were 138 feedback responses; 108 (78.3%) from relatives and 30 (21.7%) from staff. The amalgamation of data was resolved into five themes: appreciative factors (129, 93.5%), organizational skills (44, 31.9%), palliative care (38, 27.5%), staff communication (14, 10.1%), and VV process issues (11, 7.9%). A total of 131 (94.9%) responses had positive comments (111 from relatives, 20 from staff); negative comments were greater in the staff cohort (23%)Ã‚Â than the relative group (4%).Ã‚Â Trends included sub-themes in overwhelming emotions, emotional strain for staff members, and difficult situations. Conclusions VV in hospitals is a new and valuable way to connect patients with loved ones with mostly positive consequences. VV also has risks to mental health and well-being, particularly for healthcare workers facilitating the call.","Dhahri, De Thabrew, Ladva, Pardoe","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13435","20210226","covid-19; quality improvement projects; video telemedicine; virtual visits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11293,""
"Accessing behavioral health care during COVID: rapid transition from in-person to teleconferencing medical group visits","Effective and safe behavioral health interventions in primary care are critical during pandemic and other disaster situations. California shelter-in-place orders necessitated rapid transition of an effective mindfulness-based medical group visit (MGV) program from in-person to videoconferenced sessions (VCSs). Aim: to Describe procedures, acceptability, and feasibility of converting from in-person to VCS. Methods: qualitative. Dataset: primary care. Intervention: a six-session 2-h MGV program with educational and mindfulness components was converted. Four in-person sessions and two VCSs were held. General Anxiety Disorder and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were administered at first and last sessions. A semi-structured focus group was conducted after session six. Population studied: six primary care patients (42Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) with stress, anxiety, or depression participated. Procedural changes included remote material distribution, scheduling, hosting, and facilitation functions using the Zoom platform. The focus group revealed that patients preferred in-person sessions during initial visits, but appreciated transitioning to VCS, which provided continued support during a challenging time. Instruction on technical (e.g. logging on) and social (e.g. signaling next speaker) aspects of VCS was suggested. Building relationships through conversations was an important part before and after in-person sessions missing from VCS. Patients suggested combining in-person and VCS to allow relationship building while also improving access. While many procedural changes were needed to facilitate conversion to VCS, primary care patients seeking stress, anxiety, and depression interventions found VCS acceptable during COVID-19. Future iterations of this program are proposed which incorporate procedural changes and facilitate relationship building between patients in VCS.","Juarez-Reyes, Mui, Kling, Brown-Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1177/2040622321990269","20210226","anxiety; behavioral health; depression; medical group visits; mindfulness; stress; teleconference visits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11294,""
"Lessons From the First Wave of COVID-19: Work-Related Consequences, Clinical Knowledge, Emotional Distress, and Safety-Conscious Behavior in Healthcare Workers in Switzerland","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) imposes an unusual risk to the physical and mental health of healthcare workers and thereby to the functioning of healthcare systems during the crisis. This study investigates the clinical knowledge of healthcare workers about COVID-19, their ways of acquiring information, their emotional distress and risk perception, their adherence to preventive guidelines, their changed work situation due to the pandemic, and their perception of how the healthcare system has coped with the pandemic. It is based on a quantitative cross-sectional survey of 185 Swiss healthcare workers directly attending to patients during the pandemic, with 22% (<i>n</i> = 40) of them being assigned to COVID-19-infected patients. The participants answered between 16th June and 15th July 2020, shortly after the first wave of COVID-19 had been overcome and the national government had relaxed its preventive regulations to a great extent. The questionnaire incorporated parts of the &quot;Standard questionnaire on risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak&quot; (version 2015), which were adapted to the case of COVID-19. Clinical knowledge was lowest regarding the effectiveness of standard hygiene (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Knowledge of infectiousness, incubation time, and life-threatening disease progression was higher, however still significantly lower than regarding asymptomatic cases and transmission without physical contact (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). 70% (95%-confidence interval: 64-77%) of the healthcare workers reported considerable emotional distress on at least one of the measured dimensions. They worried significantly more strongly about patients, elderly people, and family members, than about their own health (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Adherence to (not legally binding) preventive guidelines by the government displayed patterns such that not all guidelines were followed equally. Most of the participants were faced with a lack of protective materials, personnel, structures, processes, and contingency plans. An increase in stress level was the most prevalent among the diverse effects the pandemic had on their work situation. Better medical equipment (including drugs), better protection for their own mental and physical health, more (assigned) personnel, more comprehensive information about the symptoms of the disease, and a system of earlier warning were the primary lessons to be learned in view of upcoming waves of the pandemic.","Riguzzi, Gashi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.628033","20210226","COVID-19; clinical knowledge; healthcare workers; mental health; prevention; risk perception; stress; work situation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11295,""
"Centennials, FOMO, and Loneliness: An Investigation of the Impact of Social Networking and Messaging/VoIP Apps Usage During the Initial Stage of the Coronavirus Pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic has had obvious, well-documented devastating effects on people's physical health. In this research, we investigate its potential effects on people's mental health. Many people have experienced social isolation, as countries attempt to stem the spread of the disease through confinement and other forms of social distancing. Intuitively, such social isolation may increase feelings of loneliness, and people may take logical steps to reduce their feelings of social isolation and loneliness. One route is through the use of social networking apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and messaging and VoIP apps (e.g., WhatsApp, iMessage). In this research, we investigate the effects of pandemic-induced social isolation on social networking and messaging apps, and potential related effects on loneliness. We surveyed young adults (<i>N</i> = 334) who are part of the Centennial cohort (born after 1995) from three different countries (Italy, Argentina, UK) and obtained their screen time usage data over a 4-week period starting from mid-March 2020. This sampling procedure allowed us to obtain data from respondents who were experiencing different degrees of mandated social isolation (lockdowns), which enabled us to determine whether social network and messaging app usage increased as a function of social isolation, and to test potential effects on levels of loneliness. Results showed that only social network usage increased in the initial stage of confinement as a function of lockdown initiation. Additionally, social network app usage was associated with increased feelings of loneliness, and this relation was mediated by fear of missing out (FOMO). In contrast, messaging app usage was associated with decreased feelings of loneliness, and was unrelated to FOMO. These results suggest that technology may be useful for mitigating the impact of loneliness during social isolation but that it is necessary to promote usage of messaging and VoIP apps, rather than social networking apps, because they are directly associated with decreases in loneliness without increasing FOMO.","Fumagalli, Dolmatzian, Shrum","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.620739","20210226","COVID-19; centennials; fear of missing out; loneliness; messaging apps; social network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11296,""
"Impulsivity Mediates Associations Between Problematic Internet Use, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms in Students: A Cross-Sectional COVID-19 Study","<b>Background:</b> Problematic internet use (PIU) is a serious global mental health issue that especially manifested during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Engagement in PIU as an impulsive coping with mental distress may pose a long-lasting threat to develop anxiety and depressive disorders. The first aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of PIU and mental distress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students in Lithuania. The second aim was to test the hypothesis that PIU affects anxiety and depressive symptoms through the mediating role of impulsivity. <b>Methods:</b> The cross-sectional study was comprised of 619 university students (92.9% females and 7.1% males) with a mean age of 22 Ã‚Â± 3 years who participated in an online survey from May to November, 2020. Participants completed the following scales: the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11. K-means cluster analysis and one-way multivariate analysis of variance were used for group comparison in terms of internet use time and habit change during COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the mediating effect of impulsivity in association between PIU and mental distress, while controlling for age. <b>Results:</b> In sum, 45.1% of the participants reported PIU and 38.1% had markedly expressed symptoms of anxiety while 43.6% of the students reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic 76% of the students reported at least moderate increase in their internet use time. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the group of frequent internet users. The results of the structural equational modeling analysis showed a statistically significant effect of PIU on subjective anxiety symptoms and the statistically significant effect of PIU on subjective depression symptoms, both mediated via impulsivity. <b>Conclusions:</b> During COVID-19 pandemic, PIU, anxiety and depression symptoms are highly prevalent among students. Findings also suggest that relationships between PIU, anxiety and depressive symptoms are mediated via impulsivity. These results underscore the importance of the inclusion of impulsivity factor in the studies analyzing longitudinal effects of PIU on mental distress during COVID-19 pandemic.","Gecaite-Stonciene, Saudargiene, Pranckeviciene, Liaugaudaite, Griskova-Bulanova, Simkute, Naginiene, Dainauskas, Ceidaite, Burkauskas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.634464","20210226","COVID-19; Problematic Internet Use; anxiety; depression; impulsivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11297,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical and Mental Health in Lower and Upper Middle-Income Asian Countries: A Comparison Between the Philippines and China","<b>Objective:</b> The differences between the physical and mental health of people living in a lower-middle-income country (LMIC) and upper-middle-income country (UMIC) during the COVID-19 pandemic was unknown. This study aimed to compare the levels of psychological impact and mental health between people from the Philippines (LMIC) and China (UMIC) and correlate mental health parameters with variables relating to physical symptoms and knowledge about COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> The survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms, contact history, and knowledge about COVID-19. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). <b>Findings:</b> The study population included 849 participants from 71 cities in the Philippines and 861 participants from 159 cities in China. Filipino (LMIC) respondents reported significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress than Chinese (UMIC) during the COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) while only Chinese respondents' IES-R scores were above the cut-off for PTSD symptoms. Filipino respondents were more likely to report physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), recent use of but with lower confidence on medical services (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), recent direct and indirect contact with COVID (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), concerns about family members contracting COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), dissatisfaction with health information (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In contrast, Chinese respondents requested more health information about COVID-19. For the Philippines, student status, low confidence in doctors, dissatisfaction with health information, long daily duration spent on health information, worries about family members contracting COVID-19, ostracization, and unnecessary worries about COVID-19 were associated with adverse mental health. Physical symptoms and poor self-rated health were associated with adverse mental health in both countries (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings of this study suggest the need for widely available COVID-19 testing in MIC to alleviate the adverse mental health in people who present with symptoms. A health education and literacy campaign is required in the Philippines to enhance the satisfaction of health information.","Tee, Wang, Tee, Pan, Reyes, Wan, Anlacan, Tan, Xu, Harijanto, Kuruchittham, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.568929","20210226","COVID-19; China; Philippines; anxiety; depression; knowledge; middle-income; precaution","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11299,""
"Health care worker burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey study in Saudi Arabia","To estimate the prevalence of burnout among health care workers (HCWs) who are working in Saudi Arabia during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and explore individual and work-related factors associated with burnout in this population. In this cross-sectional study conducted between June to August of 2020, we invited HCWs through social channels to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire inquired about demographics, factors related to burnout, and used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory scale to indicate burnout. A total of 646 HCWs participated. The mean (SD) age of participants was 34.1 (9.5) years. Sixty-one percent were female. The prevalence of burnout among HCWs was 75%. Significant factors associated with burnout were age, job title, years of experience, increased working hours during the pandemic, average hours of sleep per day, exposure to patients with COVID-19, number of times tested for COVID-19, and perception of being pushed to deal with COVID-19 patients. Health care workers as frontline workers, face great challenges during this pandemic, because of the nature of their work. Efforts should be made to promote psychological resilience for HCWs during pandemics. This study points out the factors that should be invested in and the factors that may not be influential.","Alsulimani, Farhat, Borah, AlKhalifah, Alyaseen, Alghamdi, Bajnaid","https://doi.org/10.15537/smj.2021.42.3.20200812","20210226","Coronavirus disease-2019; anxiety; burnout; depression; health care workers; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11300,""
"Incidence of psychological illness after coronavirus outbreak: a meta-analysis study","The COVID-19 has had an enormous impact worldwide and is still spreading. Globally confirmed infections have surpassed 41.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°million, of which more than 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°million resulted in deaths. Considering the relationship between public health disasters and emotional disorders, it is essential to examine psychological well-being related to this pandemic. We performed a systematic search on psychological problems from PubMed to 10 October 2020, and conducted a meta-analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V.3 software. The results showed a 19.4% and 26.8% pooled incidence for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively, during the SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-related coronavirus outbreaks. However, overall prevalence of depression was somewhat higher at 27.0% during the COVID-19 period. The pooled incidence of PTSD during COVID-19 compared with SARS and MERS outbreaks, was lower, at 16.4%. The results suggest that there are shared and distinct psychological responses following SARS, MERS and COVID-19, and show pessimistic estimates of a wide range of potentially upcoming psychological problems.","Fan, Zhang, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215927","20210226","communicable diseases; epidemics; meta analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11301,""
"Adapting practice in mental healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and other contagions: systematic review","During the global COVID-19 pandemic, there has been guidance concerning adaptations that physical healthcare services can implement to aid containment, but there is relatively little guidance for how mental healthcare services should adapt service provision to better support staff and patients, and minimise contagion spread. This systematic review explores service adaptations in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and other contagions. The Allied and Complementary Medicine database (AMED), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science were systematically searched for published studies from database inception to April 2020. Data were extracted focusing on changes to mental health services during contagion outbreaks. Data were analysed with thematic analysis. Nineteen papers were included: six correspondence/point-of-view papers, five research papers, five reflection papers, two healthcare guideline documents and one government document. Analysis highlighted four main areas for mental health services to consider during contagion outbreaks: infection control measures to minimise contagion spread, including procedural and practical solutions across different mental health settings; service delivery, including service changes, operational planning and continuity of care; staff well-being (psychological and practical support); and information and communication. Mental health services need to consider infection control measures and implement service changes to support continuity of care, and patient and staff well-being. Services also need to ensure they are communicating important information in a clear and accessible manner with their staff and patients, regarding service delivery, contagion symptoms, government guidelines and well-being.","Raphael, Winter, Berry","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.20","20210226","COVID-19; best practice; clinical governance; mental health services; service changes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11302,""
"The relationship between 2019-nCoV and psychological distress among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder","The psychological distress caused by COVID-19 may be pronounced among the parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among parents of children with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1764 parents of children with ASD and 4962 parents of typically developing (TD) children were recruited. The participants completed an online survey which contained demographic information, the impact due to COVID-19 crisis, resilience, coping styles, anxiety and depression. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the contributions of these variables to anxiety and depression. After adjusting for demographic variables, the following factors were associated with parents' anxiety and depression symptoms: (i) Whether or not the participants had a child with ASD; (ii) resilience; (iii) coping strategies, and; (iv) the impact due to COVID-19. Among these, the psychological stress caused by COVID-19 played the most important role in parental anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.353) and depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.242) symptoms. Parents of children with ASD had lower levels of resilience and positive coping, and used more negative coping strategies than parents of TD children. Among all participants, 8.0 and 24.2% of parents had symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared to parents of TD children, more parents of children with ASD exhibited symptoms of anxiety and depression (12.2% vs. 6.6%; 31.0% vs. 21.7%, respectively). During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents experienced varying levels of anxiety and depression, particularly, parents of children with ASD. More specific attention should be paid to parental mental health and long-term effective intervention programs, that are targeted towards parents of children with ASD, and such programs should be promoted around China in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.","Wang, Li, Pan, Zhai, Xia, Sun, Zou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00674-8","20210226","2019 novel coronavirus disease; Anxiety; Autism spectrum disorder; Depression; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11303,""
"The impact of COVID-19 social isolation on aspects of emotional and social cognition","The present study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 social isolation upon aspects of emotional and social cognitive function. We predicted that greater impairments in emotional and social cognition would be observed in people who experienced more disruption to their usual social connectivity during COVID-19 social isolation. Healthy volunteers (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°92) without prior mental health problems completed assessments online in their own homes during the most stringent period of the first COVID-19 &quot;lockdown&quot; in the UK (March - May 2020). Measures included two questionnaires probing levels of social isolation, anxiety levels, as well as five neuropsychological tasks assessing emotional and social cognition. Reduced positive bias in emotion recognition was related to reduced contact with friends, household size and communication method during social isolation. In addition, reduced positive bias for attention to emotional faces was related to frequency of contact with friends during social isolation. Greater cooperative behaviour in an ultimatum game was associated with more frequent contact with both friends and family during social isolation. The present study provides important insights into the detrimental effects of subjective and objective social isolation upon affective cognitive processes.","Bland, Roiser, Mehta, Sahakian, Robbins, Elliott","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2021.1892593","20210226","COVID-19; Social cognition; mental health; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-27","",11304,""
"Association between perceived stress, fear and anxiety of COVID 19 with self-care in pregnant women: a cross-sectional study","Pandemic COVID-19 has negative effects on the mental health of all people, especially pregnant women. This study aimed to determine the psychological effects of COVID-19 on self-care in pregnant women. The Cross-sectional study using the Multistage sampling technique was conducted among 215 pregnant women selected randomly from the Iranian Integrated Health System in 2020. Data were collected using demographic and obstetrics questionnaires, Pregnancy Self-Care Scale, Fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 Anxiety Scale(CDAS), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) by the self-report method. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 21 with Pearson correlation test and multivariable linear regression.The Mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) of Fear, anxiety, perceived stress, and self-care was 20.85(6.45), 18.20(10.45), 31.16 (7.65) and 40.84(4.11), respectively. The correlational analyses showed small positive significant associations between Fear (r=0.20; P=0.004) and anxiety of COVID-19 (r=0.14; P=0.03)with self-car but the association between perceived stress and self-care was small negative significant (r= -0.14; P=0.04). Based on regression analysis, 11% of the self-care changes could be explained by three independent variables (ÃŽÂ²= 0.130, SE= 0.043, P=0.002).
