"Examining the mental health adversity among healthcare providers during the two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a cross-sectional, survey-based study","The current global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the whole population, but healthcare workers are particularly exposed to high levels of physical and mental stress. This enormous burden requires both the continuous monitoring of their health conditions and research into various protective factors. Cross-sectional surveys. Self-administered questionnaires were constructed assessing COVID-19-related worries of health workers in Hungary. The surveys were conducted during two consecutive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (N-first wave=376, N-second wave=406), between 17 July 2020 and 31 December 2020. COVID-19-related worry, well-being and distress levels of healthcare workers. We also tested whether psychological resilience mediates the association of worry with well-being and distress. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The results indicated that healthcare workers had high levels of worry and distress in both pandemic waves. When comparing the two waves, enhanced levels of worry (Wald's Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=4.36, p=0.04) and distress (Wald's Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=25.18, p&lt;0.001), as well as compromised well-being (Wald's Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=58.64, p&lt;0.001), were found in the second wave. However, not all types of worries worsened to the same extent across the waves drawing attention to some specific COVID-19-sensitive concerns. Finally, the protective role of psychological resilience was shown by a mediator analysis suggesting the importance of increasing resilience as a key factor in maintaining the mental health of healthcare workers in the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results render the need for regular psychological surveillance in healthcare workers.

"Relationship between working conditions and psychological distress experienced by junior doctors in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey study","This paper explored the self-reported prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among junior doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also reports the association between working conditions and psychological distress experienced by junior doctors. A cross-sectional online survey study was conducted, using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and Health and Safety Executive scale to measure psychological well-being and working cultures of junior doctors. The National Health Service in the UK. A sample of 456 UK junior doctors was recruited online during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to January 2021. Junior doctors reported poor mental health, with over 40% scoring extremely severely depressed (45.2%), anxious (63.2%) and stressed (40.2%). Both gender and ethnicity were found to have a significant influence on levels of anxiety. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis outlined the specific working conditions which significantly predicted depression (increased demands (ÃŽÂ²=0.101), relationships (ÃŽÂ²=0.27), unsupportive manager (ÃŽÂ²=-0.111)), anxiety (relationships (ÃŽÂ²=0.31), change (ÃŽÂ²=0.18), demands (ÃŽÂ²=0.179)) and stress (relationships (ÃŽÂ²=0.18), demands (ÃŽÂ²=0.28), role (ÃŽÂ²=0.11)). The findings illustrate the importance of working conditions for junior doctors' mental health, as they were significant predictors for depression, anxiety and stress. Therefore, if the mental health of junior doctors is to be improved, it is important that changes or interventions specifically target the working environment rather than factors within the individual clinician.","Dunning, Teoh, Martin, Spiers, Buszewicz, Chew-Graham, Taylor, Gopfert, Van Hove, Appleby, Riley","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061331","20220823","COVID-19; education &amp; training (see medical education &amp; training); health &amp; safety; human resource management; organisational development; quality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36451,""
"Functional brain connectivity prior to the COVID-19 outbreak moderates the effects of coping and perceived stress on mental health changes A first year of COVID-19 pandemic follow-up study","The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to investigate the psychological impact of a global major adverse situation. Our aim was to study, in a longitudinal prospective, the demographic, psychological and neurobiological factors associated with inter-individual differences in resilience to mental health pandemic impact. We included 2,023 healthy participants (age: 54.32Ã‚Â±7.18 years, 65.69% females) from the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative cohort. A linear mixed model was used to characterize the change in anxiety and depression symptoms based on the collected pre- and during-COVID-19 data. During pandemic, psychological variables assessing individual differences in perceived stress and coping strategies were obtained. Additionally, in a subsample (N=433, age:53.02 Ã‚Â± 7.04 years, 46.88% females) with pre-pandemic resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging available, networks' system segregation (SyS) was calculated. Multivariate linear models were fitted to test associations between COVID-19-related changes in mental health and demographics, psychological features and brain networks status. The whole sample showed a general increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms after the pandemic onset, and both age and sex were independent predictors. Coping strategies attenuated the impact of perceived stress on mental health. SyS of fronto-parietal control and default mode networks were found to modulate the impact of perceived stress on mental health. Preventive strategies destined for the promotion of mental health at an individual's level during future similar adverse events should consider intervening on sociodemographic and psychological factors, as well as their interplay with neurobiological substrates.","Cabello-Toscano, VaquÃƒÂ©-AlcÃƒÂ¡zar, Cattaneo, Solana-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Bayes-Marin, Abellaneda-PÃƒÂ©rez, MaciÃƒÂ -Bros, Mulet-Pons, Portellano-Ortiz, Fullana, Oleaga, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, BargallÃƒÂ³, Tormos, Pascual-Leone, BartrÃƒÂ©s-Faz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2022.08.005","20220823","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health; brain networks; coping strategies; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36452,""

"Prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress among frontline healthcare workers at COVID-19 isolation sites in Gaborone, Botswana","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with mental health outcomes and healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress, among frontline HCWs at COVID-19 isolation and treatment sites in Gaborone, Botswana. This was a cross-sectional study using self-administered questionnaires at the six (6) isolation facilities. The 42-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) was used to assess for the outcomes. The proportions are presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Logistic regression analysis identified predictors of the outcomes. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. A total of 447 participants with a median age of 30 years responded. Depression, anxiety and stress were detected in 94 (21.0% (95% CI 17.3-25.1%)), 126 (28.2% (CI 24.1-32.6%)) and 71 (15.9% (12.6-19.6%)) of the participants respectively. Depression was associated with smoking (AOR 2.39 (95% CI 1.23-4.67)), working at the largest COVID-19 isolation centre, Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital (SKMTH) (AOR 0.25 (95% CI 0.15-0.43)) and experience of stigma (AOR 1.68 (95% CI 1.01-2.81)).

This study was aimed to examine the prevalence of somatic and psychological distress among Russian university students. The cross-sectional study was conducted in March-April 2021. The participants were university students from several regions of Russia (N = 1236). The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 were used to measure the somatic and psychological distress. The prevalence of somatic burden, depression, anxiety, and stress was 72.2%, 54.7%, 63.4%, and 55.4%, respectively. Somatic burden, anxiety, and stress were more frequently observed in females and students with experience of COVID-19 disease compared to males and students without experience of COVID-19 disease.

"Self-reported mental well-being of mothers with young children during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: A mixed-methods study","Mothers of young children have been identified as a particularly vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to explore how occupational, psychosocial and partnership-related factors were associated with their self-reported mental well-being during the first COVID-19 wave. Five hundred fifty participants of the BaBi cohort study (est. 2013, Bielefeld, North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany) were invited to complete an online survey and to take part in email interviews (April-May 2020). With survey data, we assessed self-reported mental well-being through validated instruments (eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire; short version of the Symptom Checklist) and ran linear regression models for occupational, psychosocial and partnership-related factors. We performed content analysis on the interviews' data to further understand the determinants of the women's mental well-being. One hundred twenty-four women participated in the survey; of which 17 also participated in the interviews. A perceived lack of support in childcare was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, while having a higher internal locus of control was associated with lower levels. Psychological distress was higher in those reporting lack of emotional or childcare support. Interviews confirmed the interplay of potential stressors and highlighted the difficulties to reconcile different expectations of motherhood. Occupational, psychosocial and partner-related factors can act (to varying degree) both as resources and stressors to the self-reported mental well-being of mothers of young children. These impacts took different forms and created opportunities or challenges, depending on specific life circumstances, such as work or family situations, relationships and own psychosocial resources. Although not representative, our study contributes to building the COVID-19 evidence base, delineating the mental health toll of the pandemic on mothers of young children and the factors that contribute to it.","Wandschneider, Batram-Zantvoort, Alaze, Niehues, Spallek, Razum, Miani","https://doi.org/10.1177/17455057221114274","20220823","COVID-19; mental health; mixed-methods analysis; motherhood; occupational status; psychosocial determinants; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36456,""
"Caring Contacts to Reduce Psychiatric Morbidity Following Hospitalization During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Caring Contacts are an emerging intervention that aims to reduce distress and suicide risk after acute psychiatric care. This trial aimed to determine whether, during a pandemic, there was any evidence that the mental health benefits and reduction in suicidal ideation (SI) associated with delivering Caring Contacts to recently discharged psychiatric patients were greater than a control communication. The secondary objective was to identify whether the predicted benefits were greater among people living alone or those diagnosed with depression. A single-site pilot randomized clinical trial (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°100), with patients recruited from the adult Inpatient Psychiatry Unit at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada between August 2020 and May 2021. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the Caring Contact or control group. Participants received three Caring Contact or control communications via email or mail (on days 4, 21, and 56 post-discharge). Mental health symptoms were assessed using the self-report Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scores at discharge (baseline) and when participants received each communication. Analysis of variance was used for the primary comparisons and exploratory analyses for subgroups. Both groups experienced a significant worsening of mental health symptoms at all time points post-discharge relative to baseline. There were no significant differences between groups at any time point, however, on day 4 there was a 24.2% and 72.6% attenuated worsening in the Caring Contact group compared to the control group for total symptom severity and SI, respectively. There was no significant interaction effect for the depression subgroup or those living alone. While this pilot study was not powered to identify significant differences between groups, results are indicative of feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and provide some indication that Caring Contacts may have benefited patients in the days following discharge, supporting the need for larger-scale trials.

Many countries do not have the budgetary allocation for mental health. while those with budgetary allocation spend less than 5% of government health expenditure on mental health. Considering the continent's socioeconomic difficulties, it is almost a given that mental health illnesses will be on the rise.

"Psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in cancer patients on active treatment","Although cancer patients have a high risk of exposing COVID-19 and developing severe complications, they have to receive active treatment. We aimed to determine the psychological conditions of cancer patients and shed light on the establishment of early psychological intervention and intervention policies by making specific recommendations. We consecutively evaluated 385 cancer patients under treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and associated sociodemographic/clinical characteristics were investigated. In addition, we applied depression-anxiety-stress-scale-21 (DASS-21) for the mental states of patients and Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R) for the psychological effects of Covid-19. The mean age was 58 (18-88). 47.2% were psychologically distressful per DASS-21, and 39.3% were traumatic per IES-R scores. 71.9% stated the risk of getting COVID-19 was high since they had cancer, and 82% stated serious complications would develop if they had COVID-19 infection. Patients diagnosed for more than one year were more stressed, anxious, and depressive (p-value = 0.001,0.003,0.049, respectively). Singles were more stressed, depressed, and traumatized than couples (p-value = 0.001, 0.011, 0.001). In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation with being under psychiatric treatment before the pandemic was found for depression (OR: 3.743, 95 %CI: 1.790-7.827) anxiety (OR: 3.776-95 %CI: 1.945-7.332) and stress levels (OR: 4.129, 95 %CI: 1.728-9.866).

With drastically increased time spent at home and limited health and social service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients' experience of high EE warranted attention. The study aimed to investigate the experience of high EE among people with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed the service users of 2 community mental health centers, including participants with psychotic and nonpsychotic disorders. Valid responses from 303 participants indicated an overall high EE prevalence of 71.62%, much higher than previous findings, which range between 30% and 40%. People with other psychotic and nonpsychotic disorders showed a higher probability of experiencing high EE than people with schizophrenia. Participants reported a higher probability of experiencing high EE as a result of caregiving by other family relatives and friends than by parents. Findings suggest a significantly elevated high EE prevalence among people suffering from mental illness in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is worth further evaluating the long-term effects of high EE beyond the pandemic.","Ng, Gao, Wang, Cheuk, Li, Fung","https://doi.org/10.1093/schizbullopen/sgac049","20220823","COVID-19; expressed emotions; mental illness; pandemic; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36460,""

Patients were included if they had at least one ambulatory visit between March 14, 2020 and September 30, 2020 and a CPD diagnosis any time before March 14, 2020. Telemedicine users (2+ virtual visits after March 14, 2020) were propensity score-matched 1:1 with standard care users (minimum of 1 in-person or virtual ambulatory visit and maximum of 1 virtual visit after March 14, 2020) based on several baseline characteristics. Monthly use of various healthcare services was compared between the two groups from 12 months before to 3 months after their index in-person or virtual ambulatory visit after March 14, 2020 using generalized estimating equations (eg, hospitalizations, emergency department [ED] visits, and outpatient physician visits). The slope of change over the study period (ie, rate ratio) as well as a ratio of slopes, were calculated for both telemedicine and standard care groups for each outcome. A total of 18 333 pairs of telemedicine and standard care patients were identified after matching (60.8% male, mean [SD] age 45.4 [16.3] years). There was a significantly greater decline across time in the telemedicine group compared to the standard care group for ED visits due to any psychiatric conditions (ratio of slopes for telemedicine vs standard care (95% CI), 0.98 (0.98 to 0.99)). However, declines in primary care visit rates (ratio of slopes for telemedicine vs standard care (1.01 (1.01 to 1.02)), mental health outpatient visits with primary care (1.03 (1.03 to 1.04)), and all-cause outpatient visits with primary care (1.01 (1.01 to 1.02)), were steeper among the standard care group than telemedicine group. Overall, patients with CPDs appeared to benefit from telemedicine as evidenced by increased outpatient healthcare utilization and reductions in ED visits due to psychiatric conditions. This suggests that telemedicine may have allowed this patient group to have better access and continuity of care during the initial waves of the pandemic.","Shakeri, Chu, Stamenova, Fang, Barker, Vigod, Bhatia, Tadrous","https://doi.org/10.1093/schizbullopen/sgac046","20220823","Ontario; Propensity Score; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Virtual Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36461,""
"Aggression and Violence During the Lockdown Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic in Kuwait","The lives of the global population have been drastically altered since the emergence of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. These changes comprise their daily lifestyle practices and the professional, and educational systems. In addition to these changes, many psychological illnesses issues have been detected globally. This study aimed to investigate whether there are significant sociodemographic differences in reported cases of physical and verbal aggression, anger, hostility, and violence among 815 Kuwaiti residents during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A non-random sample was recruited through the WhatsApp platform. The online survey contained sociodemographic information and 29 self-reported items rated on a Likert scale. In addition to demographic questions, online questionnaires included the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). Questions regarding violence and COVID-19 infection were included in the online survey. Men, younger people, those who were single or divorced, students, and those with a lower level of education were more likely to report more instances of physical and verbal aggression, as well as hostility. To assist psychologically vulnerable individuals in overcoming the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to develop community-based strategies that are tailored to the specific conditions and cultural traditions of each country. Diverse strategies for mental health support programs administered by social workers and mental health professionals are required to reduce aggression and violence levels. Since this study is a cross-sectional survey conducted during the total lockdown, it is difficult to conclude that the lockdown provoked the escalation of the aggression.","Al-Sejari, Al-Ma'seb","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100408","20220823","Aggression; COVID-19; pandemic; sociodemographic variables; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36462,""
"On the associations between videoconference fatigue, burnout and depression including personality associations","Videoconference fatigue (hereafter VC fatigue) presents a new psychological construct, which gained momentum in course of the COVID-19 pandemic with the rise of videoconferences taking place in everyday (work-)life. In order to better characterize videoconference fatigue, it is of importance not only to investigate associations with age, gender and personality (as has been done earlier and will be revisited). Besides, it is crucial to shed light on relevant psychopathological constructs co-occurring with VC fatigue. In the present survey study, based on data from nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯311 participants we investigated the associations between VC fatigue, burnout and depression and specifically took the personality trait neuroticism into account. These constructs were robustly positively associated with each other. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that the positive association between neuroticism and burnout/depression are in parts mediated by VC fatigue. However, future studies are needed to disentangle cause and effect between the aforementioned variables. Having said this, the present study, to our knowledge, is the first to reveal associations between VC fatigue and psychopathologies.","Montag, Rozgonjuk, Riedl, Sindermann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100409","20220823","Zoom fatigue; burnout; depression; neuroticism; personality; videoconference fatigue","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36463,""
"Anxiety, Depression, and Fear among People with and without Diabetes During the Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant","The present study aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, and fear in people with and without diabetes during the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. In this comparative study (n=353), people with diabetes (n=121) and those without diabetes (n=232) were investigated for physiological aspects of COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant outbreak. This study was performed at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On request, the participants responded to the survey questionnaires, providing data on demographics, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) to screen for anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related fears. The GAD statement revealed a significantly higher degree of nervousness and anxiety among people with diabetes when compared to people without diabetes (P = 0.001). For the other GAD statements, no statistical difference was observed between the responses of people with and without diabetes, including the overall GAD-7 (P = 0.091). Moreover, no significant change was observed in the total GAD between those with diabetes and those without it. The PHQ-2 statement, concerning a feeling of depression or hopelessness noted a significant escalation among diabetes compared to nondiabetes (P = 0.004). Furthermore, in the overall PHQ-2, a significant escalation (P = 0.011) was noticed among people with diabetes compared to nondiabetes. In addition, people with diabetes had a significantly high (P = 0.037) COVID-19-related fear reported, compared to people without diabetes. The need for comprehensive research is urgent, as it will facilitate a better understanding of the physiological aspects of COVID-19 for patients with diabetes.","Robert, Al Dawish, Al Dawish, Al Mutairi, Alanazi, Al Dawish","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573399819666220822092400","20220823","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Diabetes; Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; Saud Arabia.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36464,""
"Negative emotions and creativity among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: the mediating role of psychological resilience and the moderating role of posttraumatic growth","The aim of the study was to use a moderated mediation model to understand and examine the relationship between negative emotions and creativity among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, using psychological resilience as a mediator and posttraumatic growth as a moderator. A sample of 881 college students in mainland China completed a self-report questionnaire that included four scales: the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale, Psychological Resilience Scale, Runco Ideational Behavior Scale and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Findings indicated that:(1) negative emotions were a strong predictor of creativity; (2) psychological resilience partially mediated the association between negative emotions and creativity; and (3) posttraumatic growth moderated the positive effect of psychological resilience, such that the indirect effect between negative emotions and creativity via psychological resilience was stronger for someone with a low level of resilience. The findings further clarify the mechanisms that affect the relationship between negative emotions and creativity among college students.","Zeng, Huang, Li, Xu, Xu, Wu, Chen, Yang, Shao, Wu, Zhu, Wu, Zeng","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-022-00954-8","20220822","COVID-19; Creativity; Moderated mediation model; Negative emotions; Posttraumatic growth; Psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","",36465,""
"Experiences of family caregivers of persons living with dementia with and without a smart- clothes assisted home nursing program during the heightened COVID-19 alert","The COVID-19 pandemic has required restrictions of daily activities, which has been found to impact the lives of persons living with dementia (PLWDs) and their family caregivers, who have multiple care demands. The lack of relevant studies in Taiwan emphasized the need to explore the experiences of family caregivers of older PLWDs faced with the intensified restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19, and the impact of the availability of a smart-clothes home nursing program. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with family caregivers of older PLWDs. Participants were recruited from dementia clinics of a medical center in northern Taiwan from a subset of a sample from a larger study on smart-clothes assisted home nursing care. A total of 12 family caregivers who participated in the original study were interviewed during the follow-up period; seven family caregivers of a PLWD wearing a smart-vest, which transmitted information to a home care nurse; five caregivers of a PLWD not wearing a smart-vest. Interviews were conducted by telephone because the conditions of the pandemic prevented face-to-face interviews. Recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. Interview data showed family caregivers' felt the care recipient's health was compromised and functional conditions intensified as Covid-19-related pandemic restrictions increased. Specific concerns included a lack social interactions, decreased daily activity levels, loss of interest and lack of motivation for activities, increased mood and behavioral problems, a decline in physical function and an increase in health problems. Family caregivers were also impacted by these restrictions, with significant increases in severity of caregiver role strain, including feeling trapped, a lack of in-home support, profound powerlessness, and worries about the PLWD contracting the coronavirus. The smart-clothes assisted home nursing care program offered supplementary support to family caregivers by providing on-time interactions, helping them manage health problems, enhancing predictability of the care recipient's behaviors, and providing caregivers with emotional support. The findings of this study support alternative care such as implementation of technology-assisted home health services to meet caregiver needs to facilitate family caregiving of PLWDs during the necessary restrictions in activities implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.
