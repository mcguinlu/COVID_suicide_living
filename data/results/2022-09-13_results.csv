"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of clinically extremely vulnerable children and children living with clinically extremely vulnerable people in Wales: A data linkage study","Objectives: To determine whether clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) children or children living with a CEV person in Wales were at greater risk of presenting with anxiety or depression in primary or secondary care during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with children in the general population, and to compare patterns of anxiety and depression during the pandemic (23rd March 2020-31st January 2021, referred to as 2020/21) and before the pandemic (March 23rd 2019-January 31st 2020, referred to as 2019/20), between CEV children and the general population. Design: Population-based cross-sectional cohort study using anonymised, linked, routinely collected health and administrative data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank. CEV individuals were identified using the COVID-19 Shielded Patient List. Setting: Primary and secondary healthcare settings covering 80% of the population of Wales. Participants: Children aged 2-17 in Wales: CEV (3,769); living with a CEV person (20,033); or neither (415,009). Primary outcome measure: First record of anxiety or depression in primary or secondary healthcare in 2019/20 and 2020/21, identified using Read and ICD-10 codes. Results: A Cox regression model adjusted for demographics and history of anxiety or depression revealed that only CEV children were at greater risk of presenting with anxiety or depression during the pandemic compared with the general population (Hazard Ratio=2.27, 95% Confidence Interval=1.94-2.66, p<0.001). Compared with the general population, the risk amongst CEV children was higher in 2020/21 (Risk Ratio 3.04) compared with 2019/20 (Risk Ratio 1.90). In 2020/21, the cumulative incidence of anxiety or depression increased slightly amongst CEV children, but declined amongst the general population. Conclusions: Differences in the cumulative incidences of recorded anxiety or depression in healthcare between CEV children and the general population were largely driven by a reduction in presentations to healthcare services by children in the general population during the pandemic.","Laura Elizabeth Cowley; Karen Hodgson; Jiao Song; Tony Whiffen; Jacinta Tan; Ann John; Amrita Bandyopadhyay; Alisha R Davies","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.11.22279823","20220912","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37459,""
"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Associated Major Risk Factors","Objective: To determine association of T2DM with depression, Covid-19, hypertension, junk food, weight, age, physical activity, smoking, family history, education and income. Study Design: Cross-sectional, multicenter study Duration and Place of Study: Family Health Clinic, Mehmoodabad, Ahmad Medical Centre, FB Area Karachi, Al-khidmat Hospital North Karachi, Rafah-E-Aam Hospital FB Area Karachi, from 1st November 2020 to 30th April 2021. Methodology: Pre-tested, researcher administered questionnaire was used through medics and paramedics. Information was collected from general patients and care givers. Non-diabetics and non-hypertensives were tested/checked on the spot. Results: Mean age of the participants was 35 years with minimum 18 and maximum 70 years. Males were 279 (95%). In males 30 (11%) were diabetic and in females 7 (47%) were diabetic. 168 (57%) of the participants got above matric education. Lowincome group consisted of 271 (92%) participants. Diabetes was present in 37 (13%). Forty six percent diabetics were diagnosed incidentally. Most (24;65%) were diagnosed by general practitioner, six (16%) by Family Physician, four (11%) by specialist and one (3%) by self. Conclusions: General practitioners play a pivotal role in diagnosing and managing diabetes mellitus. To reduce the burden of diabetes in Pakistan, modifiable risk factors like low education and high inflation have to be addressed. More over marriages between first cousins need to be discouraged.","Mobin, K.; Khanzada, R.; Ahmed, S.; Memon, F.; Naz, H.; Samad, A.; Naseem, S.; Shaikh, M.

"The mental health of Brazilian healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study","Objective: To compare the distress level among Brazilian healthcare professionals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and estimate risks by sex, age, and occupation. Methods: In a longitudinal cohort design, a nationally distributed online survey was used to collect data from 10,490 active healthcare professionals who worked during the pandemic. Participants were mostly female, aged 18 to 82 years;13 different health professions and all states of Brazil were represented. Results: The most frequent professions were psychology, dentistry, and nursing. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) score suggested an increased distress perception among health professionals. Females showed poorer mental health than males, but the absolute rise in Global Severity Index (GSI) score was larger in males than in females. Younger adults reported more symptoms of psychological distress than older adults. The most impacted age group was between 30-39 years. Nurse technicians presented the highest risk of distress. Conclusion: Health professionals are essential to overcoming the pandemic;thus, their mental health status should be monitored, and features associated with increased distress should be identified. Our findings suggest distress risk should be stratified by occupation, age, and sex. Health professionals showed an increased distress perception. Women, individuals between the ages of 30 and 39, nursing personnel, and physicians were more likely to report distress compared with other health professionals.","de Oliveira Serpa, A. L.; Pinto, A.

"LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE COVID-19 CRISIS: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION TO OPTIMIZE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN EUROPE","Objective: The Covid-19 health crisis has disrupted the organization and functioning of European mental health and psychiatric services, impacting the working conditions â€“ already difficult before the epidemic â€“ of professionals working therein. The Psy-GIPO2C project investigated the impact of the pandemic on these professionals. The Psy-GIPOC2C project has been co-funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche franÃ§aise (ANR, French National Research Agency) and the Centre-Val de Loire region (France). Method: This research took the form of a collaborative mixed methods study. The data collected through qualitative and quantitative research were analyzed during a working session held by the research consortium, which resulted in the formulation of recommendations for action to optimize the occupational health of European mental health professionals. Results: This research made it possible to identify and explain the extent to which, and the ways in which, the reorganization of European mental health services has impacted the mental health of the professionals working therein, and, in particular, to highlight the fact that the unprecedented use of digital devices has generated stress, and even tension, within these services. Conclusions: It is important to promote well-being at work among European mental health professionals, by involving them in the development of ad hoc measures (in addition to the existing psychological support measures available) to enable them to recharge their batteries. It is also important to support current and future professionals in their appropriation of digital tools for professional use.","Baumgart, J.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE ITALIAN VERSION OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS EMERGENCY DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRE (HEDQ)","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for health systems as it has proven to be an extraordinary emergency. Exposure to such chronic stress can have detrimental effects on the psychophysical well-being of healthcare workers, with possible manifestation of stress-related symptoms. The present study aimed to develop and validate the Healthcare Workers Emergency Distress Questionnaire (HEDQ), a self-report screening questionnaire with the purpose of identifying the healthcare workers at risk for psychological and moral distress, and PTSD-related symptoms during emergencies. Method: The HEDQ was administered to 250 healthcare workers of the AULSS 3 Serenissima and 47 citizens from the general population in Venice (Italy) during the health emergency period (from April to June 2020). In the second administration (from August to September 2020), data were collected from 101 of the 250 healthcare workers who had participated in the first administration. To test for the convergent validity, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was also administered. Results: Exploratory and hierarchical confirmatory factor analyses validated the 21-item structure of the questionnaire. Internal consistency, and factorial and convergent validity were good. Moreover, the HEDQ discriminated between those who worked in COVID-19 hospital units and those who did not (including the general population), showing good known-group validity. The two-month temporal stability of the questionnaire was excellent. The HEDQ scale scores significantly decreased from the first to the second administration, thus supporting that the tool is a measure of acute stress in healthcare workers. Conclusions: Our results provide support for the use of the HEDQ as a brief, multidimensional measure of emergency-related stress reactions in healthcare workers. Consequently, the HEDQ can be considered a useful instrument supporting clinical activity to identify those who may be more easily affected by stress reactions in the event of atypically high levels of risk exposure during crises.","Lucidi, S.; Iannattone, S.; Mallardo, F.; Spoto, A.; Lorio, R.","https://doi.org/10.36131/cnfioritieditore20220403","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Neuropsychiatry; 19(4):206-219, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37463,""
"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL HEALTH","Mental health has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims to determine the effects on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals. Through an online survey, we collected data on socio-demographic factors, workplace, isolation characteristics, psychological factors and psychiatric history, with which we assessed the degree of depression and anxiety. Conclusive statistical correlations were observed between the rate of anxiety and depression and various work-related factors. Overall anxiety and depression scores are within the range established by previous studies. Personal protective equipment was of significant importance in our study, both in terms of its availability and in terms of how staff perceived its effectiveness. Anxiety rating has contrastively correlated with the possibility of treating COVID-19 patients instead of directly interacting with them and depression rating correlates with imposed regulations such as having to suspend private medical activity. The results suggest that healthcare professionals should benefit from interventions that promote psychological support, which can mitigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health.","Palimariciuc, M.; Cristofor, A.

"Children Suffer Too: Emotional Suffering in Children during the Covid-19 Pandemic","This research aimed to investigate how students in the Initial Years of Ensino Fundamental feel in the pandemic context. The objectives were to identify the frequency of situations in which there are signs of emotional distress in children and to verify whether there is a significant relationship between emotional distress and sociodemographic aspects (race, gender, own cell phone). A total of 1041 children from the 4th and 5th grades of Ensino Fundamental participated in the research. The instrument used for this verification was a questionnaire, containing sociodemographic aspects (ethnic-racial origin, gender, economic profile and access to communication resources) and situations related to emotional distress. The data found show that children have shown both feelings and behaviors that indicate emotional distress (fear, anxiety, loneliness, self-mutilation) and also that there are significant differences in emotional distress scores related to gender and ethnic-racial origin.","Tognetta, L.

"Effects of Social Isolation on Mental Health during Covid-19 in the Context of Ageing","The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant changes to the usual rhythm of life. Reduced opportunities to meet with family members and friends in a situation of heightened stress leads to increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation, as well as increases the risk of mental health problems. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of social contacts on the changes in psychoemotional states in the elderly population in Latvia during the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis draws upon quantitative data collected by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe within Wave 8 in Latvia (n= 1207). Measurements of the frequency of social contacts were used to construct social isolation indexes. Changes of psychoemotional state, characterized by sleeping problems, nervousness, frustration during the pandemic were included as dependent variables in multinomial logistic regression models that were run to identify the effect of social isolation on psychoemotional health in the context of other factors: age, gender, perceived health status, affluence and feelings of loneliness. The results show that in the group of those aged 50+, close to one-fifth of respondents experienced the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on their mental health. The link between reduced social contacts and changes in psychoemotional states proved to be statistically significant. In the group with the highest level of social isolation, irregularities in psychoemotional health are three times higher compared to other groups.","Koroleva, I.; Snikere, S.; Aleksandrovs, A.; Reine, I.; Trapencieris, M.; Ivanovs, A.

"PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG TEENAGERS WITH DIABETES","Introduction The management of teenagers with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic has become more challenging with the negative psychosocial impact brought upon by the pandemic. Methodology We embarked on a cross-sectional study to identify the factors influencing glycaemic control (HbA1c) among teenagers with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews regarding lifestyle changes were conducted among teenagers with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), followed by the administration of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results A total of 59 adolescents with T1DM (32 males, 54.2%) and 31 patients with T2DM (10 males, 32.3%) were recruited. Overall, the HbA1c worsened from 9.13% before the COVID-19 pandemic to 9.33% during the pandemic (p-value 0.039). Significant factors which negatively influenced glycaemic control were male sex, puberty, prolonged screen time, presence of symptoms of anxiety/stress, and T2DM. However, skipping breakfast, sleep adequacy and physical activity did not directly influence the HbA1c. About one-third of the participants suffered from some form of mental disturbance (31.1% of patients had depressive symptoms, 38.9% of patients had anxiety symptoms, and 23.3% of patients experienced stress). The incidence of depression was higher among participants with T2DM, while anxiety and stress were higher among those with T1DM. Male gender, good glycaemic control pre-pandemic, and prepubertal status were associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Conclusion Besides the disruption of daily routine, glycaemic control worsened among diabetic adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A holistic management plan is needed to address the psychosocial concerns of this group to ensure optimal mental well-being and appropriate glycaemic control.","Cheng, H. P.; Selveindran, N.

"COVID-19 Pandemic Effect on Psychological Status and Perception towards the Medical Profession among Haryanaâ€™s First Year MBBS Students: A Cross-sectional Study","Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as a major health crisis throughout the world. In order to control the spread of disease in India, the Central Government imposed a nationwide lockdown. The ongoing spread of the pandemic, strict lockdown measures and delay in the opening of educational institutions in the country are expected to affect the mental health of medical college students too. In order to help and guide the students, we should first be aware of the magnitude of the problem faced by medical students due to the pandemic. For this purpose, this study was conducted online. Aim: To assess the effect of the pandemic on the psychological status of the students and their perception towards medical profession. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by the Department of Biochemistry of Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College, Haryana, India from 22nd May 2020 to 5th June 2020, among 538 first year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students from several Government and Government aided medical schools in the state of Haryana after obtaining ethical clearance. The detailed questionnaire, a study consisting of sections on the current status in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, perception towards medical profession and psychological status. It was posted online on social media platforms and the responses were collected within 15 days of posting. The psychological status was assessed based on a 21 item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Statistical analysis was done by Chi-square test, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 software. Results: Out of 538 studentâ€™s responses, it shows that 19.1% (n=103) of students experienced moderate stress, probably because of the COVID-19 outbreak and the effect it had on the social and academic aspects of their lives. About 11.5% (n=62) of students had a moderate level of anxiety, and 16.9% (n=91) had experienced moderate depression during the ongoing pandemic. Conclusion: The study demonstrates various factors, like interruptions in regular studies, social distancing, fear of infection, fear of losing a loved one, and worry about the completion of the syllabus and examinations, all cause stress and anxiety in students.","Madaan, H.; Puri, M.; Kaur, V.; Dokwal, S.; Chahal, S.","https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2022/57776.16704","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research; 16(8):BC09-BC13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37468,""

"Psychological Impact of Second Wave of Pandemic among Doctors, Nursing And Paramedical Staffs Posted for Treating Critically Ill Patients of COVID-ICU: A Retrospective Analytical Study","Aim and background: As compared to the first wave of the COVID- 19 pandemic the second wave had more impact on health care systems. During second wave the most common observation among critical health care providers was significant emotional intricacy. Since these health care providers of COVID-ICU were at risk of infection, some degree of psychological stress like depression, anxiety, and stress were experienced by them. Additionally, government-imposed lockdown had also augmented psychological impacts. Objective: The objective is to perform a retrospective analytical study to measure the change of psychological impact during the second wave of the pandemic among doctors, nursing, and paramedical staff posted for treating critically ill patients of COVID-ICU by using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS- 21). Materials and methods: All critical health care providers posted in COVID-19 ICU were entitled to involve in this study. The study was approved by the institute ethical committee (Letter No: 183/IEC/ IGIMS/2021 dated 26.06.2021). Data were prepared telephonically obtained feedback as well as dully filled received Proforma of DASS-21 Scoring Instructions from the duty doctors, nursing and paramedical staffs posted for treating critically ill patients of COVIDICU, where 21 items of questionnaires were asked. Results: One hundred seventy-one critical health care providers had participated (103 women, 68 men) in the study, who responded to the online as well as an offline survey. Participant mean age was 36.4 years. Out of the 171 complete responder 52 (30.4%) doctors, 71 (41.5%) nursing staff, and 48 (28.1%) paramedical staff were participated. During this study in general, 45 (26.3%) participants reported moderate to extremely severe depression, 49 (28.6%) reported moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 41 (24.0%) reported moderate to extremely severe stress scores. Mean Â± standard deviation values of DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress scores amongst female vs male were 7.0 Â± 3.2 vs 6.1 Â± 5.2 (p 1/4 0.004), 6.5 Â± 6.1 vs 4.9 Â± 5.8 (p &lt; 0.001), and 13.2 Â± 8.1 vs 11.3 Â± 8.9 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. After correcting the significant confounders, clinical apprehensions associated with elevated DASS-21 scores comprised not being clinically prepared (p &lt; 0.001), a scarce staff (p 1/4 0.001), having to triage patients due to shortage of COVID-19 ICU beds and/or equipment (p 1/4 0.001), COVID spread to companions and relatives (p 1/4 0.008) being accountable for other staff members (p &lt; 0.001), and being solicited to do the job in a region that was not in their capability (p &lt; 0.001).

"Surveying the Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders among Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic ABS0140)","The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged populations across the globe. The toll taken is unprecedented in the modern age. Aside from this obvious morbidity and mortality, there is an under-appreciated pandemic of mental illness that is sweeping across the world. Mental health issues in health care professionals have long since been identified to be a significant problem. Our experiences during previous similar epidemics have shown that such situations take a huge toll on the physical as well as mental health of personnel affected, either directly by infection or indirectly by the social and economic consequences of the pandemic. The health care worker may find him/herself in a very challenging situation, dealing simultaneously with multiple sources of stress in an ever-changing environment. These manifest in the form of serious mental issues such as depression, anxiety, stress, sleep disturbances, and posttraumatic stress disorder, to name a few. These can have a longlasting impact on the psychological makeup of the victims. We conducted this survey-based study to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety among a wide range of personnel involved in health care, in different settings, working in the front line and nonfront line scenarios. Aims and objectives: To assess the prevalence of developing anxiety and depression among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the prevalence thereof based on various factors such as occupation, pre-existing health issues, level of work, social background, working directly with infected patients. Materials and methods: Survey-based, prospective, observational cohort study including data collection over 1 month. The online survey was circulated as a Google Form and made available to all healthcare workers pan India. The study included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale along with other personal information, gathered anonymously. The paired t-test and Mann- Whitney U-test were used to determine the statistical significance. Results: The mean age of the population was 39.9 years, with equal distribution among the sexes. 70% of subjects were married and 76% lived with their families. The commonest co-morbidities were hypertension (n = 66), obesity (n = 61), diabetes (n = 37). 60.4% had PG qualifications, 69.3% were treating physicians, and 49.4% were consultants. 90.3% worked in urban settings, 65.5% worked at the tertiary level. 37.4% worked directly with COVID-19 patients. 24.4% of respondents worked in ICU, 14.7% in OPD, 12% in ward settings. Gross prevalence of depression was 43% (mild: 22.6%, moderate 11.2%, moderate-severe 5.1%, severe: 3.9%). Prevalence of anxiety was 47% (mild 26%, moderate 13%, severe 7%). Depression was commoner among men (p = 0.04), those in a relationship (p = 0.00), those with children (p = 0.00) in older age groups, with higher positions and educational qualifications, and those with co-morbidities (p = 0.0). It was less prevalent in front-line workers, including physicians (p = 0.00). Among the front-line workers, depression and anxiety were more prevalent among physicians (p = 0.01). Depression was commoner in OPD and ED settings (p = 0.00), and less for people getting quarantine period (p = 0.00). Conclusion: Our survey shows a higher than average prevalence of anxiety and depression among health care workers in India as compared to non-pandemic periods. We have also identified groups that are at higher risk for mental health issues .","Parathody, A.

"COVID-19 Anxiety in among the People of North Iran and its Relationship with Some Factors in 2020â€“2021","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 infection is a highly contagious disease that has affected a large population worldwide. The total number of deaths due to this virus is more than the cases caused by any of its predecessors. As there is little information about this disease, it causes anxiety in the community. Lack of related studies and anxiety problems of COVID-19 including fear of the unknown disease, imbalance of mental health and work-life, and negative feelings. AIM: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19 anxiety in among the people of North Iran and its relationship with some factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional (descriptive-analytical) study was conducted in Gorgan in 2020. Sampling was done using convenience sampling method and a sample size of 400 people was obtained. Data were collected online using the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). The collected data were analyzed using Spearman, Mannâ€“Whitney U, and Kruskalâ€“Wallis tests by SPSS version 23. To deduce quantitative responses, normality was first measured. Statistical significance level was considered at p = 0.05. RESULTS: The results showed that COVID-19 anxiety in the people of Gorgan was 15.76 Â± 9.34. Most of the participants (n = 243, 60.8%) had low levels of anxiety. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety in mental dimension (11.32 Â± 5.5) was higher than anxiety in physical dimension (4.44 Â± 4.78) in the people of Gorgan. Non-parametric Kruskalâ€“Wallis test also showed that the mean score of anxiety was significantly correlated with education level (p = 0.01) and different occupation levels (p &lt; 0.001). Regarding gender, Mannâ€“Whitney U-test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the mean score of anxiety between men and women (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that following the COVID-19 pandemic as an emerging disease, although the anxiety of the people of Gorgan was generally at a low level, this anxiety was more in the mental dimension than in the physical dimension.","Sabzi, Z.; Mencheri, H.; Yazdi, K.; Royani, Z.","https://doi.org/10.3889/OAMJMS.2022.9635","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences; 10(E):1240-1245, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37472,""
"The Influence of Parentsâ€™ Attachment on Young Peopleâ€™s Stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia","BACKGROUND: Novel Coronavirus Diseases 19 (COVID-19) pandemic bring a significant effect on the life of people, for example, various educational activities which have been conducted in school before the outbreak are now conducted in the family. This arises some problems which then become newly-emerging sources of stress. AIM: This research aims to reveal the correlation between parentsâ€™ attachment and young peopleâ€™s stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This research uses quantitative methods with online surveys. The research population is young people in Indonesia, and the research samples consist of 10-21 years-old young people who live with their parents and are willing to be the respondents of this research with 392 respondents. The sampling method utilizes accidental sampling for 4 weeks. The data were quantitatively analyzed by involving univariate and bivariate analysis as well as linear regression. RESULTS: The results of the research showed that the normality test using the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov Test on parentsâ€™ attachment and stress was normally distributed so that the linearity test was valid using the test for linearity. The test showed that young peopleâ€™s stress level depends on parentsâ€™ attachment with a negative correlation. The higher the parentsâ€™ attachment, the lower the young peopleâ€™s stress. CONCLUSION: Respondentâ€™s having a secure attachment is higher than having an insecure attachment. Parentsâ€™ attachment and young peopleâ€™s stress have a negative correlation. Almost all variables have a significant relationship with the level of stress on young people, those are age, sex, educational background, parentâ€™s educational background, and parentsâ€™ occupation. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic could increase psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression.","Purnamaningrum, Y.

"Inactivation Effect of All-Solid-State 228 nm Far-UVC Pulsed Laser","Objective The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has propelled the need for new approaches to disinfection, especially for airborne viruses. The 254 nm emission of low-pressure vacuum lamps is known for its antimicrobial effect;however, its radiation is harmful to human health, causing skin cancer and cataracts. Some studies have shown that short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light in the spectral region of 200-230 nm (far-UVC) can inactivate pathogens without harming human cells. Thus, it has great prospects for many applications. Sufficient studies have proved the antibacterial performance of far-UVC band range in an excimer lamp emitting a peak wavelength of 222 nm light. Furthermore, laser light sources can realize long-distance transmission and complement the deficiency of excimer lamps in remote sterilization and disinfection. This study investigates the antibacterial effect of a self-developed far-UVC laser with a peak wavelength of 228 nm and hopes to provide a new technical approach for the inactivation of the novel coronavirus and other microbial pathogens. Methods Bacterial sample preparation: Escherichia coli (E. coli) widely exists naturally and is a pathogen of major focus in human public health defense. It is also one of the most drug-resistant species in the enterobacterium group. Therefore, it is often used in ultraviolet disinfection and environmental health research. Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), which is closely related to humans, causes food poisoning and cannot be eliminated by pasteurization or normal hygiene procedures due to the heat and acid resistance of its spores. Therefore, the strains used in this experiment are E. coli and B. cereus. E. coli and B. cereus are provided by the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Ecology of Tropical Islands, Hainan Normal University, and subsp. Kustaki HD-1, provided by the Environmental Microbial Ecology Laboratory of Hainan Normal University. Both strains are cultured in a nutrient agar medium and placed in an incubator at 35 degrees C for 1 day. Nutrient agar medium is provided by Guangdong Huankai Microbial Technology Co., LTD, China. UV irradiation source: the irradiation source is a self-developed all-solid-state 228 nm far-UVC laser, which provides UV irradiance of up to 35 mW/cm(2), and its spectral linewidth is less than 0.1 nm. The laser is realized by LD-pumped Nd3+ laser crystal, Q-switched technology, and nonlinear optical frequency conversion technology. All-solid-state lasers have the advantages of small size, high efficiency, good beam quality, high reliability, long life, and portability. 228 nm far-UVC laser sterilization: we input a certain concentration of 1 mL bacterial suspension sample into a high permeability UVC cuvette. The 228 nm laser irradiance of 0.1 mW/cm(2) is obtained by adjusting the laser output power and the placement of the colorimeter. E. coli suspension samples are irradiated for 5, 10, 15, and 20 s [Fig. 1 (b), and B. cereus suspension samples are irradiated for 15, 30, 45, and 60 s [Fig. 1(c)] at 228 nm far-UV light of 0.1 mW/cm(2). The experiment is repeated three times for each sample at the same irradiation dose. Results and Discussions Figs. 1 (b) and (c) show the distribution of bacteria before and after 228 nm laser irradiation. The concentration of bacterial suspension samples in the control and irradiated groups is determined using the nutrient agar plate counting method. The detection results are shown in Table 1. When the E. coli suspension is irradiated by 228 nm laser for 10, 15, and 20 s (1, 1.5, and 2 mJ/cm(2)), the inactivation rates are 90. 7 %, 96.9 %, and 100 yo, respectively. When the B. cereus suspension is irradiated by 228 nm laser for 30, 45, and 60 s (3, 4. 5, and 6 mJ/cm(2)), the inactivation rates are 88. 4%, 98.6 %, and 100 %, respectively. Conclusions This experimental study shows that the use of several mJ/cm(2) doses of far-UVC 228 nm pulsed laser irradiation can effectively inactivate E. coli and B. cereus, whereas the use of excimer lamps requires dozens of mJ/cm(2) doses. Compared with the excimer light source, the far-UVC pulsed laser light source shows a stronger sterilization effect. The next step is to conduct experimental research on the inactivation of the influenza virus using a far-UVC 228 nm pulsed laser.","Zhao, Z. B.; Cheng, C.; Jin, Y. H.; Zeng, W. B.; Jin, Q.

"I Would Never Push a Vaccine on You';: A Qualitative Study of Social Norms and Pressure in Vaccine Behavior in the US","Previous researchers have established the influence of social norms on vaccine behavior. However, little work has been performed contextualizing individuals' experience with these social factors and how they operate to persuade individuals' acceptance or refusal of a vaccine. We aimed to determine the mechanisms of familial and societal pressure or expectations that contribute to COVID-19 vaccine decision-making. We conducted four focus groups and eleven individual interviews (total n = 32) with participants from across the U.S. of different vaccination statuses. We identified three emergent themes: (1) Altruistic reasoning was particularly prevalent among initially hesitant late adopters-the desire to protect loved ones and others constituted a dominant motive, more powerful than protecting oneself. Vaccination was also reckoned as part of a joint effort to return to normal life;hence, it invoked a sense of responsibility or 'obligation';;(2) expectation often became pressure;although most vaccinated participants stated that they respected others' choices, late adopters or unvaccinated participants perceived differently and felt rushed or 'forced';into choosing, and many resented being 'targeted';or 'bullied';;(3) vaccination status became a new label, frequently dividing families, thus producing familial mandates, exclusions, or social stratifications. This caused sadness and feelings of isolation, along with the formation of a camaraderie among the excluded unvaccinated. A vaccine decision builds from the complexities of individuals' experiences and cultures. The vaccinated were not free of hesitancy nor were the unvaccinated all anti-vaxxers. Vigorous vaccine promotion successfully converted some undecided individuals but also fostered distrust of government;alarmingly, the push to receive the COVID-19 vaccine further triggered doubts about established vaccines. Communication strategies need to be developed and implemented carefully so as not to ostracize the unvaccinated community and strengthen their resistance.","Lin, Cheryl, Parker, Taylor, Pejavara, Kartik, Smith, Danielle, Tu, Rungting, Tu, Pikuei","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10091402","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(9):1402, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37475,""
"Impact of Aerobic and Strengthening Exercise on Quality of Life (QOL), Mental Health and Physical Performance of Elderly People Residing at Old Age Homes","Background: The COVID-19 infection spread rapidly in Malaysia, and elderly people with underlying comorbidities were affected most. The study aimed to determine the effect of exercise on QOL and mental health among elderly people residing in old age homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Out of 178 older adults from old age homes in Kedah and Penang States, 39 respondents undertook aerobic and strengthening exercises. A single group pre-test and post-test study was conducted in one government home and nine private homes in the northern region of Malaysia. The DASS-21 scale was used to assess mental health, and the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was used to evaluate QOL. Results: After 12 weeks of the exercise programme, scores for the physical domain increased from 53.1 to 61.8, for the psychological domain from 51.8 to 59.3, for the social domain from 53.2 to 60.5 and for the environmental domain from 67.2 to 72.1. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the depression score from 6.2 to 4.4, the anxiety score from 3.5 to 2.2 and the stress score, from 4.6 to 2.8. Conclusion: Performing aerobic and strengthening exercises for a minimum of 12 weeks may have helped to improve mental health among the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it may also improve the quality of life for those who are residing in old age homes.","Maung, Theingi Maung, Jain, Timsi, Madhanagopal, Jagannathan, Naidu, Sawri Rajan L.

"Mental Health Screening during COVID-19 Pandemic among School Teachers in Malaysia: A Cross-Sectional Study","(1) Background: The teaching profession has become more challenging due to the increased use of information technology, which potentially increases psychological distress among teachers. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among school teachers in Malaysia during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated sociodemographic factors. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among primary and secondary school teachers in Malaysia. A validated DASS-21 questionnaire was used for mental health screening, and the study was conducted online during the pandemic period. (3) Results: The percentages of respondents with mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe depression were 12%, 9.7%, 4.7%, and 3.1%, respectively. Those with mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe anxiety accounted for 11.5%, 12.3%, 6.3%, and 6%, respectively. Those with mild, moderate, severe, and very severe stress accounted for 12.8%, 12%, 5.3%, and 2.5%, respectively. Perceived overworking was significantly greater during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. Significant experience in teaching, and less perceived overworking before and during the pandemic were associated with better mental health. (4) Conclusions: Periodic mental health screening for teachers may be beneficial in preventing mental health disorders and improving the quality of student education. A full assessment and innovation of the curriculum and workload should be implemented.","Maung, Theingi Maung, Tan, Sing Ying, Tay, Chai Li, Kabir, Mohammed Shahjahan, Shirin, Lubna, Chia, Tan Yong","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141710664","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(17):10664, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37477,""
"Factors Affecting University Students' Sleep Quality during the Normalisation of COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention and Control in China: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: Insufficient and poor-quality sleep have significant negative health consequences for university students in China. In this study, we aimed to assess the subjective sleep quality of university students during the normalisation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in China and to identify key factors affecting their sleep quality. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1326 university students from Hubei Province, China. Latent profile analysis was conducted on the results of class-difference tests of sleep patterns. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the influencing factors and three classes of sleep quality. Results: The overall score of sleep quality (9.18 &plusmn;3.22) among university students was assessed by using the PSQI scale, and 427 (32.20%) students reported poor sleep quality. Three distinct classes of sleep patterns were identified, namely, good sleepers (Class 1, 70.44%), poor sleep quality with less medication use (Class 2, 26.55%) and poor sleepers (Class 3, 3.01%). Conclusions: Compared with 'good sleepers', students having 'poor sleep quality with less hypnotic drug use' were influenced by their education stage, smoking habits, physical activity, depression and anxiety. Meanwhile, 'poor sleepers' may be affected by their age, origins, smoking habits, mental stress, depression and anxiety. Significant heterogeneity was confirmed in the sleep patterns of university students. Their behavioural lifestyles and mental health-related factors demonstrated different relationship patterns with sleep quality. Multiple sleep promotion interventions, including moderate aerobic exercises, psychological counselling and mindfulness training, should be regularly performed in groups to improve their sleep quality.","Yin, Fang, Chen, Chaoyi, Song, Suyi, Chen, Zhuo, Jiao, Zhiming, Yan, Ziqi, Yin, Gang, Feng, Zhanchun","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141710646","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(17):10646, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37478,""
"Gender and Psychosocial Differences in Psychological Resilience among a Community of Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The study aimed at exploring gender and additional sociodemographic differences in psychological resilience, as well as the association between resilience and psychological distress in older adults, during the first lockdown in Italy, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants attended an online survey during the first lockdown in May 2020. Psychological distress was assessed through the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, the Resilience Scale (RS) was administered to evaluate psychological resilience, and sociodemographic variables were also collected. The study involved 108 community older adults (mean age 70.02 &plusmn;3.5 years). Comparisons revealed that women reported significantly lower total scores of RS (p = 0.027), as well as lower levels of resilience-related domains, namely Meaningfulness (p = 0.049), Self-Reliance (p = 0.011), Perseverance (p = 0.035), and Existential Aloneness (p = 0.014), compared to men. Significantly higher RS scores were found in older adults being involved in a relationship, compared to those not involved in relationships (p = 0.026), and in older adults with children (p = 0.015), compared to those without offspring, suggesting the importance for older adults of not dealing alone with such a dramatic and stressful event, such as the pandemic. Negative correlations were found between psychological resilience and stress, depression, and anxiety. Linear regressions revealed that lower RS total scores, as well as lower scores in the majority of the RS scales, were associated with greater levels of stress, greater levels of anxiety, and greater levels of depressive symptoms. This study suggested that older women might appear more vulnerable in facing the pandemic, compared to men;having not lived alone through the lockdown period might also be considered as a factor of resilience for older adults.","Sardella, Alberto, Lenzo, Vittorio, Basile, Giorgio, Musetti, Alessandro, Franceschini, Christian, Quattropani, Maria C.","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12091414","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(9):1414, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37479,""
"Anxiety, Distress and Stress among Patients with Diabetes during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The prevalence of mental health disorders has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, are a particularly vulnerable risk group. This study aims to assess the levels and prevalence of anxiety, distress, and stress in patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane, LILACS, Medline, SciELO, and Scopus in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Thirty-seven articles with a total of 13,932 diabetic patients were included. Five meta-analyses were performed. The prevalence of anxiety was 23% (95% CI = 19&ndash;28) in T1DM and 20% (95% CI = 6&ndash;40) in T2DM patients. For diabetes distress it was 41% (95% CI = 24&ndash;60) for T1DM and 36% in T2DM patients (95% CI = 2&ndash;84). For stress, the prevalence was 79% (95% CI = 49&ndash;98) in T1DM patients. People with diabetes have significant psychiatric comorbidity as well as psychological factors that negatively affect disease management, increasing their vulnerability in an emergency situation.

"Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Students-A Single Center Study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused medical education to shift unprecedentedly, leading medical schools to switch to virtual platforms and modify student-patient interactions. On top of educational changes, medical students adapted to their support network, finances, and mental and physical health changes. Objective: To understand the holistic impact of COVID-19 on medical students and medical education and identify how to distribute resources during future educational disruptions in a large medical university in the United States. Methods: An anonymous online survey was distributed to medical students at Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Philadelphia, in February 2021. Participants self-reported the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their medical education, family life, financial burden, mental health, and physical health. Results: 168 out of 1088 students at Sidney Kimmel Medical College completed the survey, with 58% (98/168) of the respondents identifying as female. The class breakdown was as follows: 38% (63/168) first years, 18% (31/168) second years, 21% (36/168) third years, 20% (34/168) fourth years, and 2% (4/168) were considered 'other';(including research year, Master's program). A total of 28% of respondents reported developing new mental illness, with second years having the highest incidence at 39%. In total, 42% said the pandemic affected a previous mental health condition. Further, 96% of third and fourth years reported COVID-19 affected their clinical rotations. In total, 68% of first years reported their entrance to medical school was severely affected. Moreover, 13% reported losing a family member due to COVID-19, and 7% reported personal sickness due to COVID-19. Additionally, 16% reported incurring a financial burden due to the pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 impacted the well-being of students by affecting their mental health and financial burdens. Clinical rotations and medical school entrance were the most problematic aspects. In the future setting of major educational disruptions, this study provides a starting point for where to focus resources, mental health support, financial support, and academic flexibility.","Poluch, Maria, Ries, Robert, Ahmed, Monjur","https://doi.org/10.3390/ime1010004","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Medical Education; 1(1):11-15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37482,""
"Quality of Life in Post-COVID-19 Patients after Hospitalization","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on people's quality of life (QoL), which is affected by social and economic changes as well as by mental and physical health. The aim of this study was to determine QoL in post-COVID-19 patients who had required hospitalization, and to identify relevant sociodemographic data. We used questionnaires which considered demographic and socioeconomic data, health and vaccination status, the pandemic situation, and EQ-5D scoring. The interactions of all data and the scores of EQ-5D were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to the five dimensions of EQ-5D. In this single-hospital-cohort study, the average times elapsed since initial diagnosis and hospital admission were 2.5 (76.3 &plusmn;18.1 days) and 5 months (155.4 &plusmn;33.9 days), respectively. Post-COVID-19 females were 3&ndash;5 times more likely to be affected in terms of anxiety/depression, and in negative impact upon their usual activities, at 5 months after diagnosis. At the same time, reductions in mobility were 3&ndash;4 times more likely in elderly post-COVID-19 patients, whose levels of pain and discomfort increased. Single patients, those with low incomes, and those with severe clinical outcomes were 2&ndash;4 times more likely to experience a reduction in their usual activities, while the presence of co-morbidities and lower levels of education were associated with increased pain and discomfort. Aging-induced pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were significantly exacerbated in elderly patients with widespread vaccination. Our study revealed effects of demographic and socioeconomic factors upon lower QoL in post-COVID-19 patients in four dimensions of EQ-5D: mobility, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, 5 months after first diagnosis and hospitalization.","Mitrovic-Ajtic, Olivera, Stanisavljevic, Dejana, Miljatovic, Sanja, Dragojevic, Teodora, Å½ivkovic, Emilija, Å abanovic, MiloÅ¡, Cokic, Vladan P.","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10091666","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(9):1666, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37483,""
"Effect of COVID-19-Induced Stress among Males on the Partner Relationship and Sexual Activity during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Introduction: Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been some reports regarding the impact of COVID-19 on male psychosexual health. Aims and Objectives: To assess the severity of stress during COVID-19 and to determine the association of stress levels with partner relationships and sexual activity. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia through social media platforms via an online questionnaire between 1 December 2020 and 31 January 2021 among 871 participants after a pilot study among 20 participants, of which 497 were included in the study. Stress levels were assessed using the Arabic version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 20.0. Responses were presented as frequencies and percentages, and associations were studied using the Chi-squared test/Fisher's exact test. A value of p &le;0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 497 participants who had been infected with COVID-19 completed the survey. In total, it was found that 203 (40.8%) had severe stress scores (severe and extremely severe scores merged), while 131 (26.4%) had moderate stress scores. About 84 (16.9%) participants agreed that their sexual desire decreased, 91 (18.1%) confirmed their sexual intercourse frequency decreased, and sexual satisfaction decreased in 76 (15.3%). A significant positive correlation was found in that those who disagreed with having a good sexual relationship tended to have severe stress (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: There were increased levels of stress during the lockdown period, which impacted psychosexual health.","Alzahrani, Meshari A.; Alkhamees, Mohammad, Almutairi, Sulaiman, Abumelha, Saad M.; Khan, Muhammad Anwar, AL-Jaziri, Zainab Y.; Althunayyan, Fay A.; Hakami, Basel O.; Ahmad, Mohammad Shakil","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10091663","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(9):1663, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37484,""
"Cybervictimisation and Well-Being during the Outbreak of COVID-19: The Mediating Role of Depression","Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to modifying relational habits and increasing Internet use to engage in antisocial behaviours such as cybervictimisation. Additionally, social distancing can reinforce the relationship with internalising behaviours such as depression. Through an adolescent sample, this study examines the relationship between cybervictimisation and well-being and the mediating role of depression. The hypothesis was tested via Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis to verify the role of depression as a mediator between cybervictimisation and well-being. The main results reveal that the effect of cybervictimisation on well-being was fully mediated by depression. The findings should stimulate debate on possible interventions to promote adolescent well-being and to avoid emotional and mental health problems related to social isolation.","Palermiti, Anna Lisa, Bartolo, Maria Giuseppina, Servidio, Rocco, Costabile, Angela","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10091627","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(9):1627, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37485,""
"COVID-19 and Vulnerable Children Well-Being: Interview with Left-Behind Children in Rural China","Purpose of the study: This study sought to explore the psychological well-being, academic adjustment, and quality of parental attachment of LBC during COVID-19 based on Left-Behind Children's (LBC) word of mouth. Method: In light of the abundance of quantitative studies, this qualitative study explored the psychological, academic, and parental attachment experiences of rural LBC during COVID-19. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 LBCs aged 10&ndash;15 in May 2021. Result: The study results reveal that LBCs developed severe psychological illnesses after the pandemic severely disrupted their already disturbed lives. Our findings showed that most LBCs feel they do not need their parents, which reflects their long record of hopelessness and agony regarding the absence of their parents. Conclusion: Although COVID-19 is a global problem, its impact was particularly devastating for LBCs who have nobody around who could help them with their academic, personal and social need. In the modern COVID-19 era, it seems that Chinese grandparenting has become unreliable in the face of radical change in contemporary Education, society, and the economic system. Therefore, this study suggests that the Chinese government should seek to identify and monitor these children by working with NGOs that target such children.","Tadesse, Endale, Khalid, Sabika, Lianyu, Cai, Gao, Chunhai","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9091317","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children; 9(9):1317, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37486,""
"Examining the Longitudinal Associations between Adjustment Disorder Symptoms and Boredom during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a myriad of stressors, underscoring the relevance of adjustment disorder during these extraordinary times. Boredom-as a feeling and as a dispositional characteristic-is an equally pertinent experience during the pandemic that has been cross-sectionally linked to various mental health difficulties. The current longitudinal study expanded on this work, examining the associations between adjustment disorder symptoms and boredom (both as a feeling and as a trait) over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Community participants completed questionnaires three times, rating their trait boredom at Time 1 and their feelings of boredom and adjustment disorder symptoms (preoccupation with a pandemic stressor and failure to adapt) over the past week at Times 1&ndash;3. Latent growth curve analyses found that an increase in feelings of boredom was significantly associated with increased preoccupation with a pandemic stressor and increased difficulties with adapting over time. Additionally, trait boredom significantly predicted changes in preoccupation and the failure to adapt, such that participants high in trait boredom increasingly struggled with these symptoms over time. Our results suggest that increased feelings of boredom and a trait disposition towards boredom can be detrimental to people's ability to adjust over time to the stressors associated with the pandemic. Boredom, as an aversive state and as a chronic difficulty, may be important to address in treatment approaches for adjustment disorder symptoms during COVID-19.","Bambrah, Veerpal, Wyman, Amanda, Friedman, Eva, Eastwood, John D.","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12090311","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(9):311, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37487,""
"Mental well-being, social support, and the unique experiences of transgender and nonbinary people during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a myriad of novel stressors, and early research suggests the mental well-being of many has suffered as a result. Transgender and nonbinary (TN) people in particular may have experienced additional stressors related to their gender identity, and may not have had access to minority coping resources that could normally buffer against experiencing negative mental health outcomes. In May 2020, 1160 cisgender heterosexual, 369 cisgender lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ), and 195 TN people completed a survey on their mental well-being and experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also asked TN participants about how their lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+) identity intersected with their experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that TN participants experienced more psychological distress and less social support than cisgender heterosexual participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that social support was associated with less psychological distress among TN participants during the pandemic;however, LGBQ+ and TN community connectedness were not related to distress. Using inductive thematic analysis, we summarize TN participants' descriptions of the ways that their LGBTQ+ identities intersected with the pandemic to change their access to gender-affirming services and behaviours, their home and public life, and their experiences of affirming social support and/or LGBTQ+ community connectedness. Together, our findings provide valuable insights into the experiences of TN people during the pandemic and highlight the ways in which our ""normal"" society is difficult for TN people to inhabit.","O'Handley, B.; Courtice, E.

"COVID-19 and Healthcare Professionals: The Psychological Impact of the Pandemic on Healthcare Professionals and the Use of EMDR Early Interventions","Recent research has provided new information on the impact of COVID-19 and previous pandemics on the mental health of healthcare professionals (HCP). Several studies have found that HCP are greatly affected by pandemics and may develop anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The stress caused by the intense working conditions and the fear of contracting and transmitting the virus are major vulnerability factors for these workers, increasing their risk of developing a mental health condition. It is therefore essential to provide appropriate support to this population in order to reduce and avoid the psychological burden of the current pandemic on their mental health. Considering the data previously published on the COVID-19 pandemic and past epidemics, the present article aims to provide an epidemiological review of the psychological impact of a pandemic on healthcare professionals. Furthermore, it examines, from a theoretical perspective, whether EMDR early interventions (EEI) may constitute an effective solution in order to provide psychological support to HCP in hospitals. Lastly, the article will identify various protocols for EEI, which, it argues, should be the approaches of choice for providing early support following a potentially traumatic event.","Saint-Jammes, J.

"Pandemic Times and the Experience of Online EMDR Practice in Greece: A Qualitative Study on Obstacles and Perspectives","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a biopsychosocial impact on the Greek mental health system by worsening symptoms of depression and stress in the general population. As the need for mental health services increased, the pandemic strongly affected EMDR practice, and training which was mainly online, during 2020. In a small sample consisting of 40 EMDR practitioners, a brief online questionnaire was administered concerning the obstacles that professionals believe they face doing online EMDR therapy in Greece during the pandemic. A conventional qualitative analysis was conducted on the respondents' feedback by coding the content. Among others, the results showed two categories of practical and psychosocial defects in the efficient application of online EMDR practice. Lack of physical contact, poor application of bilateral stimulation based on technical difficulties, poor computer skills, and physical exhaustion due to continuous lockdown were some of the content subcategories. The results are discussed concerning the current context of the pandemic and local characteristics. Moreover, practical implications for online EMDR practice are discussed.","Papanikolopoulos, P.; Prattos, T.; Foundoulakis, E.","https://doi.org/10.1891/EMDR-2021-0033","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Emdr Practice and Research; 16(3):135-144, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37490,""
"Investigation of Sport-Related Habits in College Students after Covid-19 Epidemic","Introduction: China's covid-19 epidemic is under control. Universities and schools across the country have resumed physical education classes, but the mental health knowledge of college students in the aftermath of the covid-19 outbreak has not been investigated. Objective: To study college students' mental health and sports-related habits after the covid-19 outbreak. Methods: This study comprehensively used literature materials, expert interviews, mathematical statistics, and other methods to study the sports-related attitudes and health awareness of college students before and after the outbreak of the new epidemic, examining the health knowledge domain of college students. Results: In the survey dimensions related to students' sports knowledge, the highest mean score was for""emotional control"" at 3.48, followed by ""participation motivation"" at 3.41 and ""participation attitude""at 3.35. The scores of sports participation attitude, motivation, and sports emotion for males were equal and higher than in females, where the measures of emotional factors and motivation to participate reached significant levels. After the epidemic, the mean scores for students' participation attitude, sports emotion, and motivation to participate in sports exceeded the theoretical mean. Conclusion: After the health awareness and prevention work in the community and school network, university students'sports attitudes and awareness improved significantly compared to before the Covid-19 outbreak.","Zhao, W.","https://doi.org/10.1590/1517-8692202329012022_0155","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Brasileira De Medicina Do Esporte; 29, 2023.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37491,""

"Managing mood-related symptoms utilizing diet, targeted nutrient supplementation, and lifestyle changes: A case series","Background The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion reports that mental health disorders are one of the most â€œcommon causes of disability,â€ affecting 18.1% of adults in the United States. This case series examines the use of diet, targeted nutrient supplementation with a focus on amino acids, and lifestyle interventions for the management of mood-related symptoms as a treatment option. Case Presentations The three cases included a personalized amino acid therapy protocol, nutrient cofactor supplementation, and diet and lifestyle recommendations. Clinical assessment questionnaires completed by the clients at intervals during care were used to determine proper amino acid dosing. The first client is a 65-year-old Caucasian male presenting with increased stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. A marked decrease in symptoms was experienced three months. The second client is a 24-year-old Caucasian male presenting with concentration and memory impairment, anxiety and depression, food cravings leading to binge eating of carbohydrates, low sleep quality, and unsustainable energy. A substantial decrease in symptoms was achieved in under four months. The third client is a 23-year-old Caucasian male presenting with depression, easy agitation while ruminating on negative thoughts, difficulty focusing and making decisions, poor memory, concentration, and sleep quality, gaming addiction, and low energy and motivation. The client experienced considerable relief from all symptoms in under six months. Conclusion The case series demonstrated marked improvement in mood-related symptoms in as little as 3â€“6 months for three individuals utilizing amino acid therapy along with dietary, targeted nutrient supplementation, and lifestyle choices.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.explore.2021.09.006","20220901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37496,""

"The Role of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for the Mental Health Consequences of Widowhood during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Spousal loss is associated with immediate declines in mental health. However, the mental health consequences of widowhood during the Covid-19 pandemic have remained largely unexplored. In this research note, we use data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe and fixed effects regression modelling to address three research questions: (1) How has the mental health of older adults changed across time in 10 European countries? (2) Do the surviving spouses of persons who died during the pandemic face greater declines in mental health compared to adults widowed prior to the pandemic? (3) To what extent did the strictness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) moderate the pandemic widowhood penalty for mental health? We found that feelings of depression increased dramatically for those widowed during the pandemic compared to widowed adults prior to the pandemic. In addition, the pandemic widowhood penalty does not apply to all those who lost their partners during the pandemic, but only to those who lost their partner during periods when strict NPIs were being enforced by governments. Our findings support that notion that the Covid-19 pandemic and strict NPIs exacerbated risk factors and hindered protective factors that affect older adultsâ€™ resilience to spousal death.","Zachary Van Winkle et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0204-A7E-CA6","20220913","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; depression; covid-19; longitudinal; widowhood","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-13","",37499,""
