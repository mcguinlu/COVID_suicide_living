"Mental health of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and evidence-based frameworks for mitigation: A rapid review","Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the mental health of health care workers (HCWs), and optimal strategies to provide psychological support for HCWs are not currently established. Aims: To rapidly review recently-published literature on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Query of all quantitative research through the PubMed database on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic which utilized validated mental health instruments. 723 articles were screened and 87 articles were included. Results: Nearly all included studies were cross-sectional, survey-based assessments of the prevalence of and risk factors for mental illness. Only one interventional study was identified. Prevalence of mental health outcomes varied widely: 7.0-97.3% anxiety, 10.6-62.1% depression, 2.2-93.8% stress, 3.8-56.6% post traumatic stress, 8.3-88.4% insomnia, and 21.8-46.3% burnout. Risk and protective factors were identified in personal and professional domains, including degree of COVID-19 exposure, adequacy of protective equipment, and perception of organizational support. Conclusions: The myriad risk factors for poor mental health among HCWs suggests that a comprehensive psychosocial support model with individual- and organization-level interventions is necessary. Further longitudinal research on specific evidence-based interventions to mitigate adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs is urgently needed as the pandemic continues.","Ajay Major; Fay J Hlubocky","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249166","20210104","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8895,""
"""Recovering With Nature"": A Review of Ecotherapy and Implications for the COVID-19 Pandemic","Connection with nature has been considered beneficial for psychological well-being since times of evolution. Differences in Indian and Western thoughts have viewed natural elements in different lights, varying between eco-centrism to anthropocentrism. The intrusion of technology and digitalized lives as a result of globalization has decreased connectedness with nature. Ecotherapy is a novel form of psychotherapeutic technique based on explicit environmental or ecological interventions. Social and therapeutic horticulture, animal-assisted interventions, care farming, green exercise, environmental conservation and wilderness therapy are some of the ecosystem-based approaches used in mental health. Based on the principles of positive and client-centered psychology, ecotherapy-related techniques have been shown to be effective in medical disorders like hypertension, obesity, post-surgical recovery and psychosocial conditions like depression, stress reduction, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) and adjustment disorders. The principles of ecotherapy have been integrated into other psychotherapeutic techniques for better efficacy. This review attempts provides an overview of techniques, applications and challenges related to ecotherapy in psychology. The implications of its use during the ongoing Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, social isolation and consequent psychosocial aftermath are also discussed.","Chaudhury, Pourabi; Banerjee, Debanjan","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604440","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Public Health;8: 604440, 2020.; Publication details: Front Public Health;8: 604440, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8896,""
"Experiences, Attitudes, and Needs of Users of a Pregnancy and Parenting App (Baby Buddy) During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of expectant parents and parents of young babies, with disruptions in health care provision and loss of social support. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown on this population through the lens of users of the UK National Health Service-approved pregnancy and parenting smartphone app, Baby Buddy. The study aims were threefold: to gain insights into the attitudes and experiences of expectant and recent parents (with babies under 24 weeks of age) during the COVID-19 pandemic; to investigate whether Baby Buddy is meeting users' needs during this time; and to identify ways to revise the content of Baby Buddy to better support its users now and in future. METHODS: A mixed methods study design combining a web-based survey with semistructured telephone interviews among Baby Buddy users in the United Kingdom was applied. Data were collected from April 15 to mid-June 2020, corresponding to weeks 4-13 of the lockdown in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 436 expectant (n=244, 56.0%) and recent (n=192, 44.0%) parents responded to the web-based survey, of which 79.1% (n=345) were aged 25-39 years and 17.2% (n=75) spoke English as their second language. Of the 436 respondents, 88.5% (386/436) reported increased levels of anxiety around pregnancy, birth, and being a new parent, and 58.0% (253/436) were concerned about their emotional and mental health. Of the 244 pregnant respondents, 43.4% (n=106) were concerned about their physical health. Telephone interviews with 13 pregnant women and 19 recent parents revealed similarly increased levels of anxiety due to reduced health care provision and loss of support from friends and family. Although a minority of respondents identified some positive outcomes of lockdown, such as family bonding, many telephone interviewees reported feeling isolated, disregarded, and overwhelmed. Recent parents were particularly anxious about the impact of the lockdown on their baby's development and socialization. Many interviewees were also concerned about their physical health as a consequence of both limited access to face-to-face medical appointments and their own poorer dietary and physical activity behaviors. Across both samples, 97.0% (423/436) of respondents reported that Baby Buddy was currently helping them, with many commenting that its role was even more important given the lack of face-to-face support from health care and parenting organizations. Greater speed in updating digital content to reflect changes due to the pandemic was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened anxiety and stress among expectant parents and those with a young baby, and for many, lockdown has had an adverse impact on their physical and mental well-being. With reductions in health care and social support, expectant and new parents are increasingly relying on web-based resources. As a free, evidence-based app, Baby Buddy is well positioned to meet this need. The app could support its users even more by actively directing them to the wealth of existing content relevant to their concerns and by adding content to give users the knowledge and confidence to meet new challenges.","Rhodes, Alexandra; Kheireddine, Sara; Smith, Andrea D","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23157","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;8(12): e23157, 2020 12 09.; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;8(12): e23157, 2020 12 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8897,""
"Consumer Reported Care Deferrals Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the Role and Potential of Telemedicine: Cross-Sectional Analysis","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic forced many health systems to proactively reduce care delivery to prepare for an expected surge in hospitalizations. There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects, but it is hoped that telemedicine can provide a viable alternative. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand what type of health care services were being deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the role played by telemedicine to fill in care gaps, and changes in attitudes toward telemedicine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. Our main outcomes were use of telemedicine and reports of care deferral during the shutdown. RESULTS: Deferred care was widespread-48% (n=812) of respondents deferred care-but it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concerns about negative health effects. In total, 30.2% (n=242) of those who delayed care were concerned about health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic; it was seen as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by respondents who were over 65 years of age, female, and college educated. Mental health services stood out for having high levels of deferred care. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary health system shutdowns will give rise to deferred care. However, much of the deferrals will be for preventive services. The effect of this on patient health can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and delivering other services through telemedicine. Having telemedicine as an option is particularly crucial for mental health services.","Atherly, Adam; Van Den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Hart, Victoria; Gleason, Kelsey; Carney, Jan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21607","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(3): e21607, 2020 09 14.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(3): e21607, 2020 09 14.; Attitude to Health; Coronavirus Infections; Health Care Rationing; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/virology; Primary Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8898,""
"Pregnancy and COVID-19","There are many unknowns for pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical experience of pregnancies complicated with infection by other coronaviruses e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, has led to pregnant woman being considered potentially vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physiological changes during pregnancy have a significant impact on the immune system, respiratory system, cardiovascular function, and coagulation. These may have positive or negative effects on COVID-19 disease progression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy remains to be determined, and a concerted, global effort is required to determine the effects on implantation, fetal growth and development, labor, and neonatal health. Asymptomatic infection presents a further challenge regarding service provision, prevention, and management. Besides the direct impacts of the disease, a plethora of indirect consequences of the pandemic adversely affect maternal health, including reduced access to reproductive health services, increased mental health strain, and increased socioeconomic deprivation. In this review, we explore the current knowledge of COVID-19 in pregnancy and highlight areas for further research to minimize its impact for women and their children.","Wastnedge, Elizabeth A N; Reynolds, Rebecca M; van Boeckel, Sara R; Stock, Sarah J; Denison, Fiona C; Maybin, Jacqueline A; Critchley, Hilary O D","https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00024.2020","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Physiol Rev;101(1): 303-318, 2021 01 01.; Publication details: Physiol Rev;101(1): 303-318, 2021 01 01.; /complications; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/pathology; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/virology; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Risk Factors; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8899,""
"Changes in demand for emergency ambulances during a nationwide lockdown that resulted in elimination of COVID-19: an observational study from New Zealand","OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a 5-week national lockdown on ambulance service demand during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING: High-quality data from ambulance electronic clinical records, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulance records were obtained from 588 690 attendances during pre-lockdown (prior to 17 February 2020) and from 36 238 records during the lockdown period (23 March to 26 April 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ambulance service utilisation during lockdown was compared with pre-lockdown: (a) descriptive analyses of ambulance events and proportions of event types for each period, (b) absolute rates of ambulance attendance (event types/week) for each period. RESULTS: During lockdown, ambulance patients were more likely to be attended at home and less likely to be aged between 16 and 25 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of lower acuity patients (Status 3 and Status 4) attended (p<0.001) and a corresponding increase in patients not transported from scene (p<0.001). Road traffic crashes (p<0.001) and alcohol-related incidents (p<0.001) significantly decreased. There was a decrease in the absolute number of weekly ambulance attendances (ratio (95% CI), 0.89 (0.87 to 0.91), p<0.001), attendances to respiratory conditions (0.74 (0.61 to 0.86), p=0.01), and trauma (0.81 (0.77 to 0.85), p<0.001). However, there was a significant increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions (1.37 (1.22 to 1.51), p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative absence of COVID-19 in the community during the 5-week nationwide lockdown, there were significant differences in ambulance utilisation during this period. The lockdown was associated with an increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions and is of concern. In considering future lockdowns, the potential implications on a population's mental well-being will need to be seriously considered against the benefits of elimination of virus transmission.","Dicker, Bridget; Swain, Andrew; Todd, Verity Frances; Tunnage, Bronwyn; McConachy, Emma; Drake, Haydn; Brett, Michelle; Spearing, Dan; Howie, Graham John","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044726","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e044726, 2020 12 23.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e044726, 2020 12 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8900,""
"Development of a coronavirus social distance attitudes scale","OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop a scale to assess social distance attitudes related to COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an online national survey of US adults (n = 1,074) to assess social distance attitudes, COVID-19 related beliefs and behaviors, and demographics. We assessed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis and evaluated internal consistency and validity. We assessed association of scale factors with respondent characteristics. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported a hypothesized two-factor solution. Internal consistency was high for both positive (Alpha = 0.92) and negative (Alpha = 0.91) attitude factors. Analyses supported construct and predictive validity with expected associations between scale factors and perceived norms and behavior (e.g. trips out of the home). We found an interaction suggesting that holding highly negative attitudes reduced the effect of holding positive beliefs. Both attitude factors were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Perceived COVID-19 risk (to others but not for self) and perceived severity were consistently associated with higher positive and lower negative attitudes. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19 Social Distance Attitude Scale contains positive and negative factors with high internal consistency and construct and predictive validity. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: A greater understanding and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 social distance attitudes could inform policymakers, researchers, and clinicians who seek to promote protective social distance behaviors.","An, Lawrence; Hawley, Sarah; Van Horn, M Lee; Bacon, Elizabeth; Yang, Penny; Resnicow, Ken","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.11.027","","Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Patient Educ Couns;2020 Nov 24.; Publication details: Patient Educ Couns;2020 Nov 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8901,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on College Student Mental Health and Wellness","OBJECTIVE: To test the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) pandemic on the emotions, behavior, and wellness behaviors of first-year college students. METHOD: A total of 675 first-year university students completed a full assessment of behavioral and emotional functioning at the beginning of the spring semester 2020. Of these, 576 completed the same assessment at the end of the spring semester, 600 completed at least 1 item from a COVID-related survey after the onset of COVID pandemic, and 485 completed nightly surveys of mood and wellness behaviors on a regular basis before and after the onset of the COVID crisis. RESULTS: Externalizing problems (meanÂ =Â -0.19, 95% CIÂ =Â -0.06 to 0.33, pÂ = .004) and attention problems (meanÂ =Â -0.60, 95% CIÂ =Â -0.40 to 0.80, pÂ < .001) increased after the onset of COVID, but not internalizing symptoms (meanÂ = 0.18, 95% CIÂ =Â -0.1 to 0.38, pÂ = .06). Students who were enrolled in a campus wellness program were less affected by COVID in terms of internalizing symptoms (ÃŸÂ = 0.40, SEÂ = 0.21, pÂ = .055) and attention problems (ÃŸÂ = 0.59, SEÂ = 0.21, pÂ = .005) than those who were not in the wellness program. Nightly surveys of both mood (ÃŸÂ =Â -0.10, SEÂ = 0.03, pÂ = .003) and daily wellness behaviors (ÃŸÂ =Â -0.06, SEÂ = 0.03, pÂ = .036), but not stress (ÃŸÂ = 0.02, SEÂ = 0.03, pÂ = .58), were negatively affected by the COVID crisis. The overall magnitude of these COVID-related changes were modest but persistent across the rest of the semester and different from patterns observed in a prior year. CONCLUSION: COVID and associated educational/governmental mitigation strategies had a modest but persistent impact on mood and wellness behaviors of first-year university students. Colleges should prepare to address the continued mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Copeland, William E; McGinnis, Ellen; Bai, Yang; Adams, Zoe; Nardone, Hilary; Devadanam, Vinay; Rettew, Jeffrey; Hudziak, Jim J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.08.466","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry;60(1): 134-141.e2, 2021 Jan.; Publication details: J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry;60(1): 134-141.e2, 2021 Jan.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8902,""

"COVID-19: challenges for dementia care and research; Covid-19: desafios para os cuidados e a pesquisa na demÃªncia","ABSTRACT. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns about the management and care for people with dementia and their caregivers. In this context, this work will discuss how social isolation or social distancing caused by the pandemic may impact the clinical management of people with dementia, caregivers' health, and dementia research. The pandemic disrupts all forms of social interaction and may increase the behavioral impairment of people with dementia. Regarding pharmacological treatment, telemedicine is an option, but the context of social isolation raises questions about how to manage people with dementia with lack of cognitive stimulation and non-pharmacological treatment. In addition, the impact of the pandemic on caregivers should be considered. There is some evidence that telephone counseling can reduce depressive symptoms of caregivers of people with dementia. In dementia research, social isolation imposes researchers to modify their study protocols in order to continue collecting data by developing remote tools to assess the participants such as electronic informed consent and online questionnaires and tests. Thus, there is an urgent need for the evaluation and refinement of interventions to address several cognitive, behavioral, and clinical aspects of the long-term impact of the pandemic in dementia.; RESUMO. A pandemia causada pelo COVID-19 desencadeia grandes preocupaÃ§Ãµes sobre o manejo e cuidados com as pessoas com demÃªncia e seus cuidadores. Neste contexto, discutiremos como o isolamento social causado pela pandemia pode impactar o manejo clÃ­nico de pessoas com demÃªncia, a saÃºde do cuidador e a pesquisa sobre demÃªncia. A pandemia interrompe todas as formas de interaÃ§Ã£o social e pode causar aumento do comprometimento dos sintomas neuropsiquiÃ¡tricos nas pessoas com demÃªncia. Em relaÃ§Ã£o ao tratamento farmacolÃ³gico, a telemedicina Ã© uma opÃ§Ã£o, mas o contexto de isolamento social levanta questÃµes sobre como manejar as pessoas com demÃªncia com falta de estimulaÃ§Ã£o cognitiva ou intervenÃ§Ãµes nÃ£ofarmacolÃ³gicas. AlÃ©m disso, o impacto da pandemia sobre os cuidadores deve ser considerado. Existem evidÃªncias de que o aconselhamento telefÃ´nico pode reduzir os sintomas depressivos dos cuidadores. AlÃ©m disso, o isolamento social impÃµe que pesquisadores modifiquem seus protocolos de pesquisa com o objetivo de continuar coletando dados, atravÃ©s do desenvolvimento de ferramentas remotas para avaliar os participantes, como o consentimento livre e esclarecido eletrÃ´nico e questionÃ¡rios e testes online.

"Pain as clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection and its management in the pandemic era: a literature review","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current global pandemic  The case number has increased since December 31, 2019  It has been reported that COVID-19 patients have been giving pain complaints, one of which is muscular pain  Other types of pain that have also been reported by COVID-19 patients are joint pain, stomach pain, and testicular pain  Neuropathic pain is the rarest case among others  COVID-19 mechanisms in the nerve and musculoskeletal damage are believed to be caused by the expression and distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)  Patients with pain, especially neuropathic pain, normally do not respond well to various therapies, and experience psychiatric disorders such as depression, which leads to a decrease in the patient's quality of life  Important considerations for health professionals in terms of pain management during this pandemic include ensuring treatment continuity, painkillers, utilization of telemedicine, biopsychosocial management approach, and modifying therapy needs to reduce the risks of COVID-19 complications  [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Egyptian Journal of Neurology, Psychiatry & Neurosurgery is the property of Springer Nature and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission  However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use  This abstract may be abridged  No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy  Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract  (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Widyadharma, I.

"Management of adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab during COVID-19 pandemic: a single-center real-life experienc","This article reports the experience in managing adult patients affected by AD, treated with dupilumab and followed-up at the Dermatology Unit at the time of the outbreak of the epidemic in February 5, 2020  In order to ensure care continuity and to limit hospital access during the pandemic period, a telephone triage was carried out before the scheduled visits so as to identify any patient suspected of being infected with COVID-19  If no COVID-related symptoms or recent contact with COVID-positive cases were assessed, patients were free to choose whether to come to the hospital for dermatological visit for themselves or to be telematically evaluated  In this regard, we created a specific phone line and email address, to which patients could refer sending clinical reports along with photographs  Remarkably, most patients (n=56, 78 9%) preferred to be physically evaluated, despite the concern with accessing to a COVID-19 hospital  Only five patients (7%) chose to be evaluated by using phone consultation fearing a possible contagion by going to hospital  Nevertheless, these patients still decided to continue the therapy  Four patients (5 6%), even if informed about the nonimmunosuppressive mechanism of the drug, autonomously discontinued dupilumab and canceled scheduled visits, fearing a possible worsening effect of the drug on the risk of COVID infection  Other six patients temporarily interrupted therapy and/or postponed their scheduled appointment because of COVID related problems: two patients (2 8%) were quarantined after a contact with COVID positive subjects but never developed symptoms;two patients (2 8%) reported transient fever in the absence of contacts with COVID subjects;two patients (2 8%) reported confirmed COVID-19 infection  As for the last two patients, the former was a 52 year old healthy woman who developed fever, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms which spontaneously resolved without specific therapy  The latter, a 53 year old woman with multiple comorbidities (asthma, hypertension, severe obesity, depressive syndrome) was hospitalized for fever, cough, and dyspnea and was treated with noninvasive ventilation, oxygen therapy, darunavir/cobicistat, and hydroxychloroquine, without sequelae  Importantly, most patients with AD confirmed their scheduled visits at the hospital and continued the therapy  This may have been influenced by the seasonality of AD symptoms and the worsening tendency of atopic patients during spring  Therefore, they had greater need and desire for direct care  Furthermore, patients who preferred telematic refertation were older (average age 60 2 vs 43 6)  The study can deduce that in younger people the risk perception of COVID-19 contact and of a worse clinic disease course is probably weaker, which consequently does not condition therapeutic choices","Rossi, M.; Rovati, C.; Arisi, M.; Soglia, S.; Calzavara-Pinton, P.","https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.13765","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Dermatologic Therapy;33(4), 2020.; Publication details: Dermatologic Therapy;33(4), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8924,""

"Differences in game consumption patterns between North and South China","Purpose: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many countries around the world  Due to the debate on the source of the outbreak, wildlife meat consumption has gained international attention and become an area that requires further exploration  The purpose of this research is to explore the differences in game consumption motivations and behaviours among populations in northern and southern China  Design/methodology/approach: An online survey on wild meat awareness with (potential) game consumers across the country as target groups was conducted  Findings: Results from this study showed that consumers in the southern region have a preference for wildlife  This preference was determined by factors such as natural environment, history and culture and the level of economic development  However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of game consumption between the north and south since game meat is not a major component of the daily diet  Practical implications: The government should consider banning this trade permanently to prevent future disease outbreaks caused by wildlife-to-human transmissions  Originality/value: The consumption of game meat is regional, but the animals in game trades live across a wider area, and thus, game trades have a global influence on ecological systems and human health  Therefore, this epidemic is also a global concern, which might lead people to display a highly negative attitude towards consuming game meat  Â© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Wei, L.; Hao, Y.; Zhu, H.; Li, J.","https://doi.org/10.1108/BFJ-06-2020-0528","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: British Food Journal;2020.; Publication details: British Food Journal;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8926,""

Method A systematic review of qualitative scholarly and peer-reviewed literature was conducted across 10 databases  Six papers met the inclusion criteria, were assessed for quality and were analysed using thematic synthesis  Findings Factors that serve to motivate HE students to engage with online therapy included the perception that it might enhance the quality of the therapeutic relationship, that it would facilitate more autonomy in the work, and that it might enable them to be anonymous and avoid face-to-face contact  In contrast, demotivating factors were primarily practical in nature  Fitting therapeutic work into their busy lives, technological challenges and persisting mental health stigma proved important factors  Conclusion This review synthesises the reasons why HE students might engage with or withdraw from online therapy  It highlights that students appear to view online therapy positively, but they can be inhibited by both personal and practical issues  Therapeutic services therefore need to ensure that information about the work they offer online is clear and transparent and that the platforms they work on are secure and stable  Finally, the need for further research, to keep abreast of technological developments, is recommended  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Hanley, Terry, Wyatt, Claire","https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12371","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Counselling & Psychotherapy Research;: No Pagination Specified, 2020.; Publication details: Counselling & Psychotherapy Research;: No Pagination Specified, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8933,""

"Lessons being learned between the Covid-19 pandemic and radiological emergencies: report from experts' discussions","In order to examine what lessons radiological emergency management may offer to the Covid-19 pandemic management and vice versa, a series of three online webinars were conducted with leading experts, scholars and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines essential for emergency management and long-term risk governance. The first webinar debated the lessons we are learning from the Covid-19 pandemic for radiological risk communication, the second explored issues around longer-term outcomes of a crisis and how to balance these with short-term actions whilst the third focused on the key challenges of the 'transition phase', using learning from Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima Daichii (2011) accidents. This paper reviews the discussion and provides valuable lessons for the radiation protection community. Results of the discussion indicated that: i) non-radiological and non-epidemiological consequences of emergencies, e.g. psychological (mental health), societal and economic, should not be underestimated; ii) multidisciplinary expertise is imperative for communication efforts and for effective emergency management, including decision-making in the application of protective measures; iii) stakeholder engagement, including the involvement of the potentially affected population, should be encouraged from an early stage and iv) trust is increased if policy-makers and main science agencies show a unified voice.","Martell, Perko, Zeleznik, Molyneux-Hodgson","https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6498/abd841","20210104","Covid-19 pandemic; Fukushima and Chernobyl accidents; emergency management; radiological risks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8941,""
"Frequency of depressive symptoms in Syrian refugees and Turkish maintenance hemodialysis patients during COVID-19 pandemic","Pneumonia of unknown cause was detected on 30 December 2019 in China. It was categorized as an outbreak and named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. The pandemic affects all people, but patient groups such as hemodialysis (HD) patients have been particularly affected. We do not know if refugees suffered more during the outbreak. In this study, we compared depressive symptom frequency between Syrian refugee HD patients and Turkish ones. The study had a single-center, cross-sectional design. Demographic and clinical data were collected retrospectively from patients' files containing details about past medical history, demographic variables and laboratory values. Validated Turkish and Arabic forms of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess depressive symptoms. BDI scores were compared according to nationality, demographic features and clinical data. A BDI score more than 14 was accepted as suspicion of depression. 119 patients were enrolled in the study. After the exclusion of 22 patients, 75 Turkish and 22 Syrian patients were included for further analysis. The median BDI (interquartile range) score for Turkish and Syrian patients were 12 (7-23) and 19.5 (12.7-25.2), respectively (p = 0.03). Suspicion of depression was present at 42.7% of Turkish, and 72.7% of Syrian HD patients (p = 0.013). Regarding all patients, phosphorus level, Kt/V, and nationality were significantly different between patients with and without suspicion of depression (p = 0.023, 0.039, 0.013, respectively). Syrian patients had higher BDI scores and more depressive symptoms than Turkish patients. Additional national measures for better integration and more mental support to Syrian HD patients are needed.","Sevinc, Hasbal, Sakaci, Basturk, Ahbap, Ortaboz, Mazi, Pirdogan, Ling, Unsal","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244347","20210104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8942,""

However, the accompanying neurocognitive changes remain poorly understood. We synthetize the current knowledge of viral (SARS-CoV-2) induced inflammation, mechanisms to viral entry into the central nervous system and altered neurotransmitter systems to provide an informed neurobiological explanation for the rise of neurocognitive disorders (defined as per the DSM-5 criteria). The mild and major neurocognitive disorder symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic provide a unique opportunity to address the early changes underlying neurocognitive impairment at both clinical and molecular level.

"Changes in Traumatic Mechanisms of Injury in Southern California Related to COVID-19: Penetrating Trauma as a Second Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a statewide stay-at-home (SAH) order in California beginning March 19, 2020, forcing large-scale behavioral changes and taking an emotional and economic toll. The effects of SAH orders on the trauma population remains unknown. We hypothesized an increase in rates of penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds, suicide attempts, and domestic violence in the Southern California trauma population after the SAH order. A multicenter retrospective analysis of all trauma patients presenting to 11 American College of Surgeons (ACS) Level I and II trauma centers spanning seven counties in California was performed. Demographic data, injury characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into three groups based on injury date: before SAH from 1/1/2020-3/18/2020 (PRE), after SAH from 3/19/2020-6/30/2020 (POST), and a historical control from 3/19/2019-6/30/2019 (CONTROL). POST was compared to both PRE and CONTROL in two separate analyses. Across all time periods, 20,448 trauma patients were identified (CONTROL: 7,707, PRE: 6,022, POST: 6,719). POST had a significantly increased rate of penetrating trauma (13.0% vs. 10.3%, p&lt;0.001 and 13.0% vs. 9.9%, p&lt;0.001) and gunshot wounds (4.5% vs. 2.4%, p=0.002 and 4.5% vs. 3.7%, p=0.025) compared to PRE and CONTROL, respectively. POST had a suicide attempt rate of 1.9% and a domestic violence rate of 0.7%, which were similar to PRE (p=0.478, p=0.514) and CONTROL (p=0.160, p=0.618). This multicenter Southern California study demonstrated an increased rate of penetrating trauma and gunshot wounds after the COVID-19 SAH orders, but no difference in attempted suicide or domestic violence rates. These findings may provide useful information regarding resource utilization and a target for societal intervention during the current or future pandemic(s).

"Neurological Manifestations of SARS-CoV-2: A Narrative Review","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started as an outbreak in China and soon crossed borders to affect the populations in all countries of the world. During the initial course of the disease, COVID-19 was perceived as a pneumonia-like illness. However, recent findings of COVID-19 patients suggest that the virus has the potential to disseminate to different tissues and organs, and cause significant complications. Neurological symptoms are of great significance as these usually present in and complicate critical cases. Many case reports and case series have documented the findings of neurological complications in COVID-19 patients. From the existing data, the most frequent symptoms in these patients were broadly classified into the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system, and skeletal muscular symptoms. CNS symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, cerebrovascular complications, peripheral nervous system symptoms include anosmia, ageusia, and skeletal muscular symptoms include myalgias. It is postulated that the cause may be direct CNS injury through blood and neuronal pathways or indirectly because of an immune-mediated response, hypoxia caused by decreased oxygen saturation, or by the binding of subacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors. Striking radiologic findings in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms have also emerged. As subacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 may potentially have lethal implications on the nervous system, it is important that neurologists are better informed about the spectrum of clinical manifestations, radiologic findings, and likely mechanisms of injury. Understanding the symptoms and radiologic imaging allows clinicians to consider brain imaging in any patient with suspected COVID-19 and neurological symptoms.","Khan, Farooqui, Jatoi, Jawaid, Mahdi, Khosa","https://doi.org/10.1097/NRL.0000000000000307","20210104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8945,""
"The dual pandemics of COVID-19 and racism: impact on early childhood development and implications for physicians","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted healthcare and racial inequities. This article discusses recent literature documenting the impact of racism on early childhood development, disparities in access to developmental services and ways healthcare providers and health systems can promote physician well being during these difficult times. Exposure to racism begins prenatally, and early childhood experiences with racism are intimately tied to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Early intervention is key to treating children with developmental delay, but disparities exist in accessing eligibility screening and in the provision of services. Paediatric providers are at risk of developing secondary traumatic stress and burnout, which may affect the care that they provide. New research has led to the development of resources that help paediatric providers address racism, access developmental resources in a novel manner and protect the paediatric workforce from trauma and burnout.","Brodie, Perdomo, Silberholz","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOP.0000000000000985","20210104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8946,""
"When should we use corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia?","This review aims to evaluate the evidence and recommendations for the prescription of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.","PÃƒÂ³voa, Coelho, Salluh","https://doi.org/10.1097/QCO.0000000000000709","20210104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8947,""
"For better or for worse? A pre-post exploration of the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on cannabis users","Lockdown measures aimed at limiting the number of infections and deaths from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have introduced substantial psychosocial stressors in everyday life. We aimed to investigate the influence of the Dutch lockdown on cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) and investigate relations with change in mental wellbeing and experienced psychosocial stressors during the lockdown. Explorative longitudinal baseline-, pre- and during lockdown survey study. The Netherlands, online between January 2019 and May 2020. Community sample of 120 monthly to daily cannabis users and reference group of 63 non-using controls. Change in cannabis use and CUD symptom severity from baseline to pre-lockdown to post-lockdown. Change in cannabis use motives, mental health, quality of social relationships and job status from pre-lockdown to post-lockdown. In cannabis users, lockdown related to increased cannabis use (B = 1.92, 95% CI 0.23-3.61, p = 0.027), but not CUD symptom severity. Cannabis users experienced 30% job loss and increased loneliness (p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> &gt; 100), while contact with partners (p = 0.005, BF<sub>10</sub> = 8.21) and families improved (p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> = 19.73), with no differences between cannabis users and control. Generally, mental health problems (all p's &gt; 0.277, all BF<sub>10</sub> &lt; 0.139) did not change but individual differences were significant and severity of cannabis use pre-lockdown, COVID-19 related worries, change in anxiety, expansion motives, social motives and family contact all uniquely related to variance in change in cannabis use or CUD.

"Rapid Conversion to Telemental Health Services in Response to COVID-19: Experiences of Two Outpatient Mental Health Clinics"," <b> <i>Background:</i> </b> <i>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered changes across health care systems, with many sectors seeing significant drops in patient visits. Rapid transition to telemental health (TMH) allowed for the continued delivery of mental health care. Although several guidelines and best practices are available for the methodical development of a TMH service, there are few documented procedures on rapidly converting to fully virtualized services. We discuss how two outpatient mental health clinics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus rapidly virtualized clinical services during the COVID-19 pandemic.</i> <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> <i>All current clinical appointments were converted to virtual, and all new clinical intakes were scheduled as virtual visits starting March 16, 2020. Virtualization included a modified needs assessment, updated clinic procedures, focused patient and staff training on TMH, and increased frequency of team meetings. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of clinic log and electronic health record data to examine the number of appointments and no-shows before and after COVID-19 virtualization.</i> <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> <i>Virtualization was operational within two business days. Scheduled appointments decreased 10.6% immediately postvirtualization, followed by an increase of 17.8% across the 6 months postvirtualization. No-show rates dropped from 11.9% pre- to 6.8% postvirtualization, leading to a 26.2% increase in completed visits.</i> <b> <i>Discussion:</i> </b> <i>Rapid virtualization of mental health services can occur effectively. Wider use and acceptance of TMH, especially to patient-homes, is likely in the foreseeable future as health care providers and systems reconceptualize service delivery. Future research must include analyzing the impact such changes make on clinical outcomes and patient visit volumes.</i> ","Mishkind, Shore, Bishop, D'Amato, Brame, Thomas, Schneck","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0304","20210104","behavioral health; pandemic; telehealth; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8950,""
"Thirty-day suicidal thoughts and behaviors among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak","Healthcare workers are a key occupational group at risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). We investigated the prevalence and correlates of STB among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak (March-July 2020). Data come from the baseline assessment of a cohort of Spanish hospital workers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5450), recruited from 10 hospitals just after the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak (May 5-July 23, 2020). Web-based self-report surveys assessed 30-day STB, individual characteristics, and potentially modifiable contextual factors related to hospital workers' work and financial situation. Thirty-day STB prevalence was estimated at 8.4% (4.9% passive ideation only, 3.5% active ideation with or without a plan or attempt). A total of nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6 professionals attempted suicide in the past 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. In adjusted models, 30-day STB remained significantly associated with pre-pandemic lifetime mood (odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.92) and anxiety disorder (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.90). Significant modifiable factors included a perceived lack of coordination, communication, personnel, or supervision at work (population-attributable risk proportion [PARP]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50.5%), and financial stress (PARPÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44.1%).

"Neurological and Neuropsychological Changes Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: New Observations, New Mechanisms","SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a ubiquitous receptor that interacts with the virus' surface S glycoprotein. Recent reports show that the virus affects the central nervous system (CNS) with symptoms and complications that include dizziness, altered consciousness, encephalitis, and even stroke. These can immerge as indirect immune effects due to increased cytokine production or via direct viral entry into brain tissue. The latter is possible through neuronal access via the olfactory bulb, hematogenous access through immune cells or directly across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and through the brain's circumventricular organs characterized by their extensive and highly permeable capillaries. Last, the COVID-19 pandemic increases stress, depression, and anxiety within infected individuals, those in isolation, and high-risk populations like children, the elderly, and health workers.

"The influence of COVID-19 on the mental health of final-year nursing students: comparing the situation before and during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an important impact on the academic world. It is known that university studies can influence the mental health of students, and especially those studying health sciences. In this study, we therefore sought to analyse whether the current pandemic has affected the mental well-being of final-year nursing students. This was a multi-centre study, with a descriptive, longitudinal, and prospective design. Mental well-being was evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire. A total of 305 participants were included in the study, of whom 52.1% had experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups analysed in terms of age, access to university, average marks, mental well-being self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and sense of coherence. In the case of mental well-being, a direct association was found with both the pandemic situation (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.32, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.010) and emotional exhaustion scores (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.20, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), while an inverse association was found with sense of coherence scores (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.45, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). This study shows that the mental health of students is a significant factor and one that must be taken into consideration when training nursing staff at university. There is a need to promote healthy habits and provide appropriate coping strategies. It is also important to train and prepare students for pandemic situations as these can have an important impact on the mental health of both the members of the public who will be treated by these future nursing professionals and the students themselves.","RevertÃƒÂ©-Villarroya, Ortega, LavedÃƒÂ¡n, Masot, BurjalÃƒÂ©s-MartÃƒÂ­, Ballester-Ferrando, Fuentes-Pumarola, BotiguÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12827","20210104","coronavirus; mental health; mood; nursing students; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8953,""

"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Lockdown on the Health and Living Conditions of Undocumented Migrants and Migrants Undergoing Legal Status Regularization","<b>Introduction:</b> Undocumented migrants are at high risk of adverse consequences during crises because of a lack of access to essential securities and sources of support. This study aims to describe the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the health and living circumstances of precarious migrants in Switzerland and to assess whether those undergoing legal status regularization fared better than undocumented migrants. <b>Materials and methods:</b> This cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown in April-May 2020. Undocumented and recently regularized migrants taking part in an ongoing cohort study were asked to respond to an online questionnaire. A subsample was selected to undergo semi-directed phone interviews. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 117 of the 379 (30.9%) cohort study participants responded to the questionnaire. Seventeen interviews were conducted. Migrants faced cumulative and rapidly progressive difficulties in essential life domains. As a consequence, they showed high prevalence of exposure to COVID-19, poor mental health along with frequent avoidance of health care. Moreover, the loss of working hours and the related income overlapped with frequent food and housing insecurity. Around one participant in four had experienced hunger. Despite these unmet needs, half of the participants had not sought external assistance for reasons that differ by legal status. Both groups felt that seeking assistance might represent a threat for the renewal or a future application for a residency permit. While documented migrants were less severely affected in some domains by having accumulated more reserves previously, they also frequently renounced to sources of support. <b>Conclusions:</b> The cumulated difficulties faced by migrants in this period of crisis and their limited search for assistance highlight the need to implement trust-building strategies to bridge the access gap to sources of support along with policies protecting them against the rapid loss of income, the risk of losing their residency permit and the exposure to multi-fold insecurities.","Burton-Jeangros, Duvoisin, Lachat, Consoli, Fakhoury, Jackson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.596887","20210104","COVID-19; health; impact; living conditions; lockdown; migrant; undocumented","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8955,""
"The Effect of Concerns About COVID-19 on Anxiety, Stress, Parental Burnout, and Emotion Regulation: The Role of Susceptibility to Digital Emotion Contagion","<b>Background and aims:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused social and economic turmoil, which has led to enormous strain for many families. Past work with pandemic outbreaks suggests that media attention can increase anxiety and compensatory behaviors. Social isolation can lead to increase in online communication and parents who use social media may be affected by other people's emotions online through what is known as digital emotion contagion (DEC). The current study aimed to examine the role of DEC in the relationship between stress, concern about COVID-19, parental burnout and emotion regulation (ER). <b>Methods:</b> In April 2020, an online survey was advertised in Social Media Parenting Groups and published on FIU Psychology online research system SONA. Data were analyzed using correlational analysis, linear and multiple linear regression, and moderation analysis. <b>Results:</b> Concern about COVID-19 predicted stress, depression, and parental burnout. Susceptibility to DEC significantly increased the impact of stress on parental burnout. Having relatives infected with COVID-19 increased the effect of DEC on parental burnout. A higher level of ER buffered the relationship between emotion contagion and concern about COVID-19. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that susceptibility to digital emotion contagion may have a negative effect on parents. Digital emotion contagion may increase parental burnout and is tied to stress.","Prikhidko, Long, Wheaton","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.567250","20210104","COVID-19; concern about COVID-19; digital emotion contagion; emotion regulation; parental burnout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8956,""
"Mental health problems among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19: The importance of nutrition and physical activity","Mental health problems are common among adolescents and greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence and correlates of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19. Cross-sectional study (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1794 adolescents, mean ageÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯15.26) was conducted in May 2020. An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, COVID-related fear (COVID-fear), nutrition, physical activity (PA) level and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. The prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.80%, 48.20% and 36.70%, respectively, among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. Generalized linear models revealed that female, left behind children, and students with greater COVID-fear tended to report symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety concurrently. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and COVID-fear, better nutritional status and moderately active PA were both associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while highly active PA was associated with lower levels of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19. To promote adolescents' mental health, educators should help adolescents develop a healthy lifestyle with balanced diet and regular exercise. Los problemas de salud mental son comunes en adolescentes y estÃƒÂ¡n influenciados por eventos estresantes. Se evaluÃƒÂ³ prevalencia y correlatos de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de insomnio, depresiÃƒÂ³n y ansiedad en adolescentes chinos durante el COVID-19. En mayo de 2020 se realizÃƒÂ³ un estudio transversal (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.794 adolescentes, edad mediaÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1526) mediante una encuesta en lÃƒÂ­nea para recopilar datos sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficos, miedo relacionado con COVID-19, nutriciÃƒÂ³n, actividad fÃƒÂ­sica (AF) y sÃƒÂ­ntomas de insomnio, depresiÃƒÂ³n y ansiedad. La prevalencia de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de insomnio, depresiÃƒÂ³n y ansiedad fue del 3780%, 4820% y 3670%, respectivamente. Modelos lineales generalizados revelaron que mujeres, niÃƒÂ±os abandonados y estudiantes con mÃƒÂ¡s miedo al COVID-19 tendÃƒÂ­an a informar sÃƒÂ­ntomas de insomnio, depresiÃƒÂ³n y ansiedad simultaneamente. DespuÃƒÂ©s de ajustar los factores sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficos y el miedo al COVID-19, mejor estado nutricional y AF moderadamente activa se asociaron con niveles mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de depresiÃƒÂ³n y ansiedad, mientras que AF muy activa se asociÃƒÂ³ con niveles mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de insomnio, sÃƒÂ­ntomas depresivos y de ansiedad. Se debe prestar mÃƒÂ¡s atenciÃƒÂ³n a la salud psicolÃƒÂ³gica de los adolescentes mientras se combate el COVID-19.

"Identifying Rewards Over Difficulties Buffers the Impact of Time in COVID-19 Lockdown for Parents in Australia","Physical isolation measures, known as lockdown or shelter-in-place, experienced during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have the potential to cause psychological distress. This study was conducted to examine parents' perceived stress and whether reports of rewards and challenges during lockdown impact stress. Data were collected using a cross-sectional online survey in New South Wales, Australia, across the 4-week lockdown. The survey was completed by 158 parents of children aged under 6 years. Stress was measured using the short form of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4). Rewards and challenges were reported in response to two open-ended questions. There was a weak negative correlation between PSS-4 scores and days in isolation (<i>r</i> = -0.167, <i>p</i> = 0.022), with parents who had spent longer in isolation reporting fewer stress symptoms. The relationship between time in isolation and stress was moderated by the degree to which parents described more rewards than challenges: parents who perceived high rewards and low challenges reported lower PSS-4 scores with more days in lockdown, whereas parents who perceived low rewards and high challenges reported higher PSS-4 scores with more days in lockdown. The moderation model examining associations between time in isolation and rewards ratio explained 13% of the variance in PSS-4 scores. Lockdowns are not uniformly or consistently negative experiences for parents. Identifying positive aspects of the experience may serve to buffer negative mental health risks across time. Understanding resilience strategies is critical for supporting current psychological wellbeing and to adequately prepare for future pandemic experiences.","Herbert, Mitchell, Brentnall, Bird","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.606507","20210104","COVID-19; families; isolation; parenting; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8958,""
"Psychological Symptoms in Health Professionals in Spain After the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Following the declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020, a state of alarm was decreed in Spain. In this situation, healthcare workers experienced high levels of stress, anxiety and depression due to the heavy workload and working conditions. Although Spain experienced a progressive decline in the number of COVID-19 cases until the last week of May (when a flattening of the case curve was achieved) and the work overload among health workers was substantially reduced, several studies have shown that this work overload is associated with the later emergence of psychological symptoms induced by stress. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and compassionate fatigue in health professionals. The sample consisted of 973 health professionals 16.5% men, 82.9% women, and one non-binary person. The data were collected through an online questionnaire sent to the participants by e-mail. DASS-21 was used to measure anxiety, stress and depression, PCL-C to measure post-traumatic stress and ProQOL -vIV to measure compassion fatigue. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to these levels of psychological symptomatology were evaluated. The results reveal that after the work overload experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers report psychological symptoms, post-traumatic stress and compassion fatigue. It is therefore recommended that these professionals be provided with psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of COVID-19, and consequently improve their mental health.","Dosil, Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Redondo, Picaza, Jaureguizar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.606121","20210104","COVID-19; anxiety; compassion fatigue; depression; healthcare professionals; post-traumatic stress; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8959,""
"Mental Health of Flying Cabin Crews: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> Initially, we analyzed relations between the challenging working conditions of flight attendants with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. As the COVID-19 pandemic plunged airlines into an unprecedented crisis, its impact on the mental health of flying cabin crews became the focus of a second survey. <b>Methods:</b> Flight attendants were surveyed online with DASS-21 in May 2019 (<i>N</i> = 105; sample 1) and April 2020 (<i>N</i> = 1119; sample 2), complemented with questions about working conditions (in 2019) and existential fears and fear of job loss (in 2020). <b>Results:</b> Sample 1 revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress highly correlated with the subjective assessment of working conditions, but not with objectifiable parameters. Sample 2 showed significant positive correlations between existential fears and fear of job loss with depression, anxiety and stress. Crew members, grounded in April 2020, showed significantly higher scores in depression and stress, while still flying individuals had more clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Mean value comparisons between sample 1 and 2 in DASS-21 revealed a significant increase in symptoms at the time of crisis with effect sizes of <i>d</i> = 0.63 for depression, <i>d</i> = 0.26 for anxiety, and <i>d</i> = 0.52 for stress. The incidence of clinically relevant symptoms among the respondents increased from 8 to 23% (depression), from 6 to 14% (anxiety), and from 8 to 24% (stress). <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic and associated work restrictions coincide with severe impairment of mental health of flying cabin crews, consistent with a mental health protecting function of labor.","GÃƒÂ¶rlich, Stadelmann","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.581496","20210104","COVID-19; aerospace; anxiety; aviation; depression; stress; unemployment; working conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8960,""
"Social and Psychophysiological Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Extensive Literature Review","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, now a global health crisis, has surprised health authorities around the world. Recent studies suggest that the measures taken to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak have generated issues throughout the population. Thus, it is necessary to establish and identify the possible risk factors related to the psychosocial and psychophysiological strain during the COVID-19 outbreak. The present extensive literature review assesses the social, psychological, and physiological consequences of COVID-19, reviewing the impact of quarantine measures, isolation, vast human loss, social and financial consequences in the family's economies, and its impact on the psychological health of the population. We also discussed the effect of psychophysiological factors, considering the impact of physical inactivity and modifications in nutritional habits, at psychological and physiological levels. The present review includes an actualized to date bibliography, articles for which were methodologically analyzed to verify they met the standards of quality and scientific accuracy.

"Media for Coping During COVID-19 Social Distancing: Stress, Anxiety, and Psychological Well-Being","In spring 2020, COVID-19 and the ensuing social distancing and stay-at-home orders instigated abrupt changes to employment and educational infrastructure, leading to uncertainty, concern, and stress among United States college students. The media consumption patterns of this and other social groups across the globe were affected, with early evidence suggesting viewers were seeking both pandemic-themed media and reassuring, familiar content. A general increase in media consumption, and increased consumption of specific types of content, may have been due to media use for coping strategies. This paper examines the relationship between the stress and anxiety of university students and their strategic use of media for coping during initial social distancing periods in March-April 2020 using data from a cross-sectional survey. We examine links between specific types of media use with psychological well-being concepts, and examine the moderating roles of traits (hope, optimism, and resilience) as buffers against negative relationships between stress and anxiety and psychological well-being. Our findings indicate that stress was linked to more hedonic and less eudaimonic media use, as well as more avoidant and escapist media-based coping. Anxiety, on the other hand, was linked to more media use in general, specifically more eudaimonic media use and a full range of media-based coping strategies. In turn, escapist media was linked to negative affect, while reframing media and eudaimonic media were linked to positive affect. Avoidant coping was tied to poorer mental health, and humor coping was tied to better mental health. Hedonic and need-satisfying media use were linked to more flourishing. Hope, optimism, and resilience were all predictive of media use, with the latter two traits moderating responses to stress and anxiety. The findings give a nuanced portrait of college students' media use during a pandemic-induced shutdown, showing that media use is closely intertwined with well-being in both adaptive and maladaptive patterns.","Eden, Johnson, Reinecke, Grady","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577639","20210104","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; media; stress; students; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8962,""
"Physical and Psychological Impact of the Phase One Lockdown for COVID-19 on Italians","The exceptional pandemic due to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has obliged all Italians to stay at home. In the literature, there are evidences that traumatic global events, such as natural catastrophes and pandemic, have negative effects on the physical and psychological health of the population. We carried out a survey to analyze the physical and psychological conditions of Italians during the pandemic. Due to the severe limitations in moving during the phase one lockdown, the survey was administered by internet. Results show that Italians followed the provisions established by the Italian government to avoid contamination, but 43% of them declared to have suffered from physical symptoms, in particular migraine, sleep disorders, persistent exhaustion, and difficulty of concentration. They have great fear to be contaminated or that relatives or friends can be contaminated, and they actively take actions to avoid contamination. Participants declared that they had suffered a lot of inconveniences due to restrictions in their movements, and that their life habits were strongly changed. They spent their time at home in different activities, but their psychological well-being was strongly impaired by the lockdown. The level of anxiety tripled, in relation to the prepandemic period, and 30% of males and 41% of females declared to have severe levels of depression. Participants with high levels of optimism and hopefulness show a stronger resilience against anxiety and depression. In addition, there is a negative correlation between anxiety and depression and the five factors of personality. These results show that psychological diseases must not be neglected, and that people in lockdown do need support for their psychological health, also with the help of internet and communication technologies.","Tommasi, Toro, ArnÃƒÂ², Carrieri, Conte, Devastato, Picconi, Sergi, Saggino","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.563722","20210104","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8963,""
"Relationship Between Problematic Social Media Usage and Employee Depression: A Moderated Mediation Model of Mindfulness and Fear of COVID-19","Social media plays a significant role in modern life, but excessive use of it during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a source of concern. Supported by the conservation of resources theory, the current study extends the literature on problematic social media usage during COVID-19 by investigating its association with emotional and mental health outcomes. In a moderated mediation model, this study proposes that problematic social media use by workers during COVID-19 is linked to fear of COVID-19, which is further associated with depression. The current study tested trait mindfulness as an important personal resource that may be associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 despite problematic social media use. The study collected temporally separate data to avoid common method bias. Pakistani employees (<i>N</i> = 267) working in different organizations completed a series of survey questionnaires. The results supported the moderated mediation model, showing that problematic social media use during the current pandemic is linked to fear of COVID-19 and depression among employees. Furthermore, trait mindfulness was found to be an important buffer, reducing the negative indirect association between problematic social media use and depression through fear of COVID-19. These results offer implications for practitioners. The limitations of this study and future research directions are also discussed.","Majeed, Irshad, Fatima, Khan, Hassan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.557987","20210104","COVID-19; depression; fear; mindfulness; pandemic (COVID-19); social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8964,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients With Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Risk Factors for Relapse","<b>Background:</b> The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable groups like patients suffering from substance use disorders is expected to be tremendous, and corresponding concerns were raised early on by many experts around the world. Psychosocial distress, financial insecurities and physiological problems associated with the COVID-19 crisis could be especially challenging for this group of patients. <b>Methods:</b> In the current study data was collected from a clinical sample of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD; <i>N</i> = 127) during the initial stage of the pandemic. The impact of various COVID-19 related factors (physiological, psychosocial, economic and others) on patients' personal life was evaluated. Alcohol consumption, craving, and potential posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed using different scales and their associations were analyzed. Furthermore, differences regarding these variables between comparably sized groups of patients who remained abstinent (<i>N</i> = 37), relapsed (<i>N</i> = 41), or reported unaltered drinking behavior (consuming subgroup, <i>N</i> = 49) were investigated. The impact of sociodemographic and COVID-19 factors on relapse (in comparison to abstinence) was evaluated using binary logistic regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> Our results confirmed the expected positive associations between alcohol consumption, craving, and PTSD symptoms, respectively, among patients with AUD. Furthermore, group differences indicate significantly lower levels on all three scales for abstinent patients. Although generally low PTSD scores were observed, 8% of our participants were found to be at risk of PTSD. Results of a binary logistic regression analysis indicated the presence of psychosocial COVID-19 factors (e.g., isolation, anxiety, and depression) as well as living alone as two major risk factors for relapse. <b>Discussion:</b> Our findings based on actual patient data support the anticipated negative consequences of the pandemic on persons with AUD. Crucially, our results regarding relapse emphasized psychosocial COVID-19 factors and isolation as especially challenging circumstances for persons with AUD, whereas economic and physiological health aspects seemed of minor impact on relapse.

"Prevalence and Characteristics of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Among Urban Residents in Wuhan During the Stage of Regular Control of Coronavirus Disease-19 Epidemic","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) is one of the most devastating epidemics in the 21st century, which has caused considerable damage to the physical and mental health of human beings. Despite a few regions like China having controlled the epidemic trends, most countries are still under siege of COVID-19. As the emphasis on cleaning and hygiene has been increasing, the problems related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may appear. <b>Objective:</b> This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of OCD in the urban population in Wuhan during the stage of regular epidemic control and prevention. Meanwhile, characteristics and risk factors for OCD were also explored. <b>Method:</b> Five-hundred and seventy residents in urban areas of Wuhan were recruited using the snowball sampling method to complete questionnaires and an online interview from July 9 to July 19, 2020. Collected information encompassed socio-demographics, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores, Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) scores and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI) values. <b>Results:</b> Three months after lifting the quarantine in Wuhan, the prevalence of OCD was 17.93%. About 89% of OCD patients had both obsessions and compulsions, while 8% had only obsessions and 3% had only compulsions. Top 3 common dimensions of obsessions were miscellaneous (84.0%), aggressive (76.6%), and contamination (48.9%), and of compulsions were miscellaneous (64%), checking (51.7%), and cleaning/washing/repeating (31.5%). The unmarried were more vulnerable to OCD than the married (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, odds ration = 1.836). Students had 2.103 times the risk of developing OCD than health care workers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Those with positive family history of OCD and other mental disorders (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, odds ration = 2.497) and presence of psychiatric comorbidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, odds ration = 4.213) were also at higher risk. Each level increase in sleep latency increased the risk of OCD to 1.646 times (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> In the background of regular epidemic control, the prevalence of OCD was high, and the symptoms were widely distributed. Obsessions often accompanied compulsions. Being single and a student, positive family history of OCD and other mental disorders, presence of psychiatric comorbidity, and longer sleep latency were predictors of OCD. Early recognition and detection of these issues may help to intervene in OCD.","Zheng, Xiao, Xie, Wang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.594167","20210104","COVID-19; OCD; distributions; prevalence; regular epidemic control and prevention; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8966,""

Female gender, feeling no control of the situation, reporting dissatisfaction with the response of the state during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced interaction with family and friends increased the worsening of preexisting psychiatric conditions, whereas optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends, and using social media like usual were associated with less worsening. An independent clinical investigation from the United States confirmed worsening of psychiatric conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic based on identification of new symptoms that necessitated clinical interventions such as dose adjustment or starting new medications in more than half of the patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> More than half of the patients are experiencing worsening of their psychiatric conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gobbi, PÃ…â€šomecka, Ashraf, RadziÃ…â€žski, Neckels, Lazzeri, DediÃ„â€¡, BakaloviÃ„â€¡, HrustiÃ„â€¡, SkÃƒÂ³rko, Es Haghi, Almazidou, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Pino, Alp, Jabeen, Waller, Shibli, Behnam, Arshad, BaraÃ…â€žczuk-Turska, Haq, Qureshi, Jawaid","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.581426","20210104","COVID-19; depression; general psychological disturbance; post traumatic stress disorder; psychiatric patients; worsening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8968,""
"Alcohol Use and COVID-19: Can we Predict the Impact of the Pandemic on Alcohol Use Based on the Previous Crises in the 21st Century? A Brief Review","The enormous health and economic challenges precipitated by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are comparable or even greater than those associated with previous historical world crises. Alcohol use, especially drinking to cope with stress, is a concern, as an increase in its sales has been reported in some countries during the quarantine. This study aims to provide a better understanding of what to expect in terms of alcohol consumption, risk factors for excessive use, and its potential consequences during this pandemic based on previous experiences. We investigated how traumatic events related to alcohol consumption. Studies on mass traumatic events (i.e., terrorism as 9/11), epidemic outbreaks (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003), economic crises (such as 2008's Great Recession), and COVID-19 were selected. The main keywords used to select the studies were alcohol use, drinking patterns, alcohol use disorders, and alcohol-related consequences. Previous studies reported increases in alcohol use associated with those events mediated, at least partially, by anxiety and depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Being male, young, and single also seems to be associated with a higher vulnerability to develop risky drinking behavior after those tragic events. The discussion of previous risk and protective factors can contribute to elaborate more specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of the current pandemic on people's mental health, especially alcohol-related problems.","GonÃƒÂ§alves, Moura, do Amaral, Castaldelli-Maia, Malbergier","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.581113","20210104","COVID-19; alcohol; economic crises; pandemic; terrorism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8969,""
"Perinatal Depression of Exposed Maternal Women in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Wuhan, China","<b>Objective:</b> This study aims to investigate perinatal depression in women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, and to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on perinatal depression prevalence. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional investigation was conducted into women hospitalized for delivery in Hubei Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital from December 31, 2019 to March 22, 2020, a period which encompasses the entire time frame of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was adopted to evaluate perinatal depression status. A Chi-square test and logistic regression model were utilized for data analysis. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,883 participants were included, 33.71% of whom were found to suffer from depressive symptoms. In detail, 27.02%, 5.24%, and 1.46% were designated as having mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The perinatal depression prevalence increased as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened. Compared to the period from December 31, 2019 to January 12, 2020, perinatal depression risk significantly decreased within the 3 weeks of March 2-22, 2020 (1st week: OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.78; 2nd week: OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.73; and 3rd week: OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.94); and the postnatal depression risk significantly rose within the four weeks of January 27-February 23, 2020 (1st week: OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.68; 2nd week: OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.35, 3.04; 3rd week: OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.14; and 4th week: OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.48). <b>Conclusion:</b> The dynamic change of perinatal depression was associated with the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic among new mothers who were exposed to the pandemic. An elevated risk of postnatal depression was also observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sun, Wang, Lin, Li, Yang, Liu, Peng, Wang, Yang, Ren, Yang, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.551812","20210104","COVID-19; EPDS; depression; postnatal; prenatal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8970,""
"ACE2 Correlated With Immune Infiltration Serves As A Novel Prognostic Biomarker In Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: Implication For COVID-19","The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global infection, and is seriously threatening human life, especially cancer patients. Thus, we sought to determine the clinical roles of ACE2 (the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma). TCGA, GEO and TIP datasets, and immunohistochemistry and western blot results were used to determine the prognostic and clinicopathological characteristics of ACE2. ACE2 expression was down-regulated in ccRCC tissues and cell lines. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results indicated that increased ACE2 expression was independent predictor of longer OS (HR: 0.8259, 95%CI: 0.7734-0.8819, P&lt;0.0001) and RFS (HR: 0.8023, 95%CI: 0.7375-0.8729, P&lt;0.0001) in ccRCC patients. Lower ACE2 expression was also associated with advanced tumor stage, higher histological grade and pathological stage, and metastasis. Besides, ACE2 expression was significantly positively and negatively correlated with CD4 NaÃƒÂ¯ve infiltration and CD4 Memory infiltration, respectively. Moreover, higher CD4 NaÃƒÂ¯ve and lower CD4 Memory infiltration levels were associated with better pathological features and longer OS and RFS. Furthermore, high ACE2 expression group in decreased CD4 NaÃƒÂ¯ve, enriched CD4 NaÃƒÂ¯ve and enriched CD4 memory cohort had favorable prognosis. These findings identified that AEC2 was significantly reduced in ccRCC, and decreased ACE2 was related to worse pathological features and poor prognosis. Low ACE2 expression in ccRCC may partially affect the prognosis due to altered immune cells infiltration levels.","Yang, Li, Zhang, Ma, Xie, Gong, Zhou, Gong","https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.51969","20210104","ACE2; COVID-19; ccRCC; immune infiltration; prognosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8971,""

"Prenatal care disruptions and associations with maternal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread across Canada in March 2020, provinces imposed strict lockdowns causing restrictions and disruptions to health care. These changes impacted how pregnant individuals received prenatal care and experienced childbirth. The additional stress caused by these changes may negatively affect the well-being of pregnant individuals and the developing child. This study investigated the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and birth plans of pregnant individuals in Canada and potential associations with maternal mental health. Data from 4604 participants was collected from English- and French-speaking Canadians between April 5-June 1, 2020 as part of the Canada-wide Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic study. Symptoms of maternal depression, general anxiety, and pregnancy-related anxiety were assessed. Participants also answered questions about disruptions and changes to prenatal care and their birth plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between prenatal care disruptions and maternal mental health. Cancellation of prenatal appointments and birth plan changes (specifically changes to childcare during birth and change of support person attending the birth) were significantly associated with greater odds of experiencing clinically-elevated depression, anxiety, and/or pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms. These results illustrate the need for reliable and accessible prenatal care during the pandemic, such as the integration of mental health screenings and co-ordination of prenatal care providers.","Taylor Groulx et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-941-448","20210104","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; depression; prenatal care; pregnancy; stress; anxiety; pandemic; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-05","",8978,""
