"Longitudinal changes in home confinement and mental health implications: A 17-month follow-up study in England during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant behavioural changes, one of which is increased time spent at home. Although official lockdowns were typically short-term and allowed people to leave their homes for exercise and essential activities, some individuals did not leave their home for prolonged periods due to a range of factors including clinical vulnerability. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of such 'home confinement' across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and its associated predictors and mental health outcomes. Methods: Data were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 25,390 adults in England who were followed up for 17 months from March 2020 to July 2021. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. Results: Our analyses identified three classes of growth trajectories, including one class showing a high level of persistent home confinement (24.8%), one changing class with clear alignment with national containment policy/advice (32.0%), and one class with a persistently low level of confinement (43.1%). A range of factors were found to be associated the class membership of home confinement trajectories, such as age, gender, income, employment status, social relationships and health. The class with a high level of confinement had the highest number of depressive and anxiety symptoms at the end of the follow-up independent of potential confounders. Conclusions: There was substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a striking proportion of our sample maintained a high level of home confinement over the course of 17 months, even during periods when containment measures were eased or removed and when infection rates were low. They also had the worst mental health outcomes. This group warrants special attention in addressing the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Feifei Bu; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.08.21264749","20211009","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18664,""
"Assessment of Post COVID-19 Health Problems and its Determinants in North India: A descriptive cross section study","With millions of people getting affected with COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), people living with post COVID-19 Symptoms (PCS) are expected to rise in the future{middle dot} The present study aimed at assessing PCS comprehensively and its associated factors among COVID-19 recovered adult population in north India.

MethodsIn a tertiary health centre at Delhi, an online based cross-sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire, developed by employing a nominal group technique, in aged 18 years and above who were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the month of January to April 2021. Socio-demographic, various potential risk factors, including pre-existing morbidities, vaccination status, and severity of acute COVID-19 illness, information on acute illness for management and a spectrum of PCS were collected between June 16 to July 28, 2021. Each participant was contacted telephonically before sending the survey link. PCS were presented as relative frequency; chi-square test, odds ratio, including adjusted, were calculated to rule out association between PCS and potential predictors.

ResultsA total of 773 of 1801 COVID recovered participants responded to the link reaching a participation rate of 42{middle dot}9%, with a median age of 34 years (IQR 27 to 44). Male respondents were 56{middle dot}4%. Around 33{middle dot}2% of them had PCS at four or more weeks, affecting almost all body organ systems. The most prevalent PCS were fatigue (79{middle dot}3%), pain in the joins (33{middle dot}4%), muscle (29{middle dot}9%), hair loss (28{middle dot}0%), headache (27{middle dot}2%), breathlessness (25{middle dot}3%), sleep disturbance (25{middle dot}3%) and cough (24{middle dot}9%). The prevalence of PCS was reduced to 12{middle dot}8% at 12 weeks after positive test. Factor such as female gender, older age, oxygen supplementation during the acute illness, working in healthcare care facilities, the severity of acute illness, and pre-existing co-morbid were risk factors for PCS. Further, vaccination (second dose) reduced the odds of developing PCS by 45% compared to unvaccinated participants (aOR 0{middle dot}65; 95%CI 0{middle dot}45-0{middle dot}96). Finally, 8{middle dot}3% of participants rated their overall health status was either poor or very poor following COVID-19 illness.

ConclusionsThe PCS involves almost all organ systems, regardless of the severity of acute COVID-19 illness. Two doses of vaccine help to reduce development of PCS.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAlthough the evidence is mounting in prolonged COVID-19 symptoms among COVID-19 survivors, to date, the full range of such post-COVID-19 symptoms (PCS) is not yet fully understood. There is a lack of studies that assessed PCS comprehensively among persons who have recovered from the COVID-19illness. For example, limited data are available on psychosocial, behavioral, and oral manifestations related to PCS. Further, there is a paucity of studies that included a wide range of determinants of PCS and the association of vaccination with the development of PCS across the world. Our study is the first such study conducted among COVID-19 recovered persons who with a majority of them employed in a tertiary health care institute of north India.

Added value of this studyOur study, for the first time, investigated a wide range of post-COVID-19 manifestations among COVID-19 recovered persons in organ-specific and psychosocial behavioral aspects, making this the largest categorization of PCS currently (in total 16). The study included telephonic calls to each eligible candidate which helped in ensuring the COVID-19 status at the time of the study. Since the participants either were employees in the hospital or their dependents that enhance the accuracy of reporting PCS. The most prevalent symptom was unspecific PCS (85.6%), e.g., fatigue, followed by musculoskeletal manifestations (49{middle dot}8%), Ear, Nose and Throat symptoms (47{middle dot}5%), neurological (47{middle dot}0%), cardio-respiratory (42{middle dot}4%, gastrointestinal (36{middle dot}2%), ocular symptoms (31{middle dot}9%), dermatological symptoms (31{middle dot}5%), and cardio-vascular (24{middle dot}5%) symptoms, and mental health symptoms (23{middle dot}7%). The rest of the organ specific symptoms were observed in less than 20% of the respondents. Older age, female gender, pre-existing co-morbid, oxygen supplementation during acute illness, the severity of illness, working in health care institutions were associated with PCS. Vaccination after the second dose was protective against PCS compared to non-vaccinated participants. Further, our study also reported a rating of the overall health status among COVID survivors, whereby around 8.3% of them reported being a poor or very poor health.

Implications of all the available evidencePCS affects a multi-organ organ system, irrespective of the severity of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and hospitalization. Such persistent COVID-19 symptoms, compounded by its heterogeneity among COVID survivors can pose a substantial burden to the affected individuals and their families and additional challenges for healthcare delivery and public health service. The current study shows that one in three individuals experience persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Since the COVID pandemic is still ongoing across the world, therefore, the number of people experiencing PCS is likely to be increased substantially further. An integrated PCS care strategy, but not limited to organ-specific healthcare disciplines, others such as psychosocial support, including counseling and education, rehabilitation, community-based rehabilitation programs will be required for management. Prioritization of PCS care to elder and co-morbid patients should be recommended. Expediting the vaccination drive will be helpful to reduce the development of persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Research, collaborative and multidisciplinary, is required to understand the underlying pathophysiology mechanism for PCS.","Suraj Singh Senjam; Balhara Yatan Pal Singh; Kumar Parmeshwar; Neeraj Nichal; Souvik Manna; Karan Madan; Nishat Hussain Ahmed; Noopur Gupta; Rajesh Sharma; Yashdeep Gupta; Animesh Ray; Vivek Gupta; Praveen Vashist; Atul Kumar; Lalit Dar; Jeevan Singh Titiyal; Radhika Tandon; Randeep Gulleira","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.03.21264490","20211007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18665,""
"Prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation in persons with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study from India","COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare services for chronic disorders such as epilepsy. In this study, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on persons with epilepsy (PWE) with regard to their seizure control, depression status, and medication adherence was assessed. After ethical clearance, 449 PWE who had been previously evaluated for depression at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India, were telephonically revaluated using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and surveyed for source of medication and medication adherence over past 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months. The prevalence and the association of depression, suicidality, and seizures during pandemic with different PWE variables were determined. Out of 449 PWE, 70.6% responded. 19.9% were diagnosed positive for depression as per MINI while suicidal ideation was observed in 5.4%. Seventy six (23.9%) PWE reported seizures during pandemic. The incidence was greater in females, unemployed, previously uncontrolled epilepsy, polytherapy, altered use of medications, and depressed PWE. Seizure during pandemic, increased seizure frequency, previous history of depression, and altered use of medications were all significantly associated with depression during COVID-19 pandemic (2.6-95%CI, 1.45-4.73; 1.9-95%CI, 1.01-3.57; 8.8-95%CI, 4.54-17.21; 2.9-95%CI, 1.19-7.24), and polytherapy (2.9-95%CI, 0.92-9.04), seizures during pandemic (3.9-95%CI, 1.45-10.53) and previous history of depression and suicidality, were related with suicidal ideation. COVID-19 pandemic-induced disruptions can be detrimental for PWE, and restoring services to the precovid levels as well as putting appropriate continuity plans in place for care of PWE should be a priority.","Katyal, Rashid, Tripathi, Sood","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108342","20211009","Anti-seizure medication (ASM); COVID-19; Depression; Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); Persons with epilepsy (PWE); Seizures; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18666,""
"Comparison of Emotional Approaches of Medical Doctors Against Covid-19 Pandemic: Eastern and Western Mediterranean Countries","Pandemics are states of disease that occur worldwide and sharply increase in populations. It causes life events which trigger anxiety, depression, anger, sleep deprivation, emotional distress and stress. World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, pointing to the over 118,000 cases in over 110 countries. Many healthcare workers became ill during the pandemic and some among them died. In this study we aimed to evaluate and compare level of stress against COVID-19 pandemic among doctors from Turkey and Italy. This research is a cross-sectional study in which Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) are administered online via social networks. All data collection tools were delivered to individuals between 1-15 June 2020 and filled in online with Google Forms application. In total 618 individuals were included in this study and all of them were medical doctors. Higher PS and STS levels were found related to woman gender, being married, working in pandemic hospital and older ages. Stress levels were found statistically higher in Turkish doctors comparing to Italian doctors for both stress scales (Turkish/Italian PSS:20.18Ã‚Â±7.90/ 19.35Ã‚Â±6.71, STSS: 44.19Ã‚Â±13.29/ 38.83Ã‚Â±13.74). The number of doctors per 1,000 of population is lower and per capita visits to a physician is higher in Turkey comparing to Italy. Besides pandemic, these heavier working conditions, increased weekly working hours can cause stress for Turkish doctors. Reporting information such this study and international collaborations are essential to plan future prevention strategies. We need to strengthen international ties and build more international collaborations rather than staying within our national silos. Additionally, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented.","Ozen, Zanfardino, Ozen, Acan, Piscopo, Casaburo, Gicchino, Confetto, Troncone, Iafusco","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14973","20211009","Covid- 19; Doctors; PSS; PTSS; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18667,""
"Job loss predicts worsening depressive symptoms for young adults with autism: A COVID-19 natural experiment","Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high rates of both unemployment and depression. Though job loss predicts increased risk of depression in the general population, studies have yet to directly examine this relationship among individuals with ASD. With the backdrop of rising unemployment due to COVID-19, we used a longitudinal design to examine whether employment changes predicted increasing depressive symptoms among young adults with ASD. Online surveys were collected from young adults with ASD at two times: just before widespread social distancing measures were adopted in the United States, and again 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks later. Both time points included measurement of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-2). At Time 2, COVID-related employment changes and the perceived impact of those changes on well-being were collected. Of the young adults who were employed at Time 1 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 144), over one-third (37.5%) reported employment changes during the first 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of COVID-19. Most of this change was job loss or reductions in hours or pay (""job loss/reduction""). Controlling for Time 1 depressive symptoms, young adults who experienced job loss/reduction had significantly higher depressive symptoms at Time 2 than those without an employment change. Individuals' perceived impact of employment change also predicted depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that losing a job or experiencing reductions in hours or pay leads to worsening depressive symptoms among adults with ASD. Better supporting autistic adults in the workplace may not only decrease the likelihood of job loss, but also combat the exceedingly high rates of depression in this group. LAY SUMMARY: Though unemployment has been linked to mental health problems in the general population, this relationship is seldom considered among adults with autism. In this study, we found that adults on the autism spectrum who lost their jobs or experienced reductions in pay or hours during the first 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of COVID-19 had worsening depression compared to adults who did not have job changes. Our findings suggest that increasing access to employment may help alleviate poor mental health among autistic adults.","Taylor, Adams, Pezzimenti, Zheng, Bishop","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2621","20211009","COVID-19; adults; autism spectrum disorder; depression; employment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18668,""

"COVID-19 pandemic's effects and telehealth in Early Psychosis Services of Quebec, Canada: Will changes last?","To explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic first wave in Quebec, Canada on practices in early intervention services (EIS) for first-episode psychosis, including reorganization of clinical and administrative practices and teleconsultation use. Adopting a cross-sectional descriptive study design, a 41 questions online survey was sent to the team leaders of all the 33 Quebec EIS, of which 100% responded. Data were collected from 18 May to 4 June 2020 and analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Programmes were categorized as urban/non-urban and results were compared between these. All 33 existing Quebec EIS (16 urban and 17 non-urban) completed the survey. Among them, 85% did not experience redeployment of EIS team staff and 58% reported stable frequency of patient interactions, either in-person or through telemedicine. During the studied period, 64% of programmes reported that all professionals used teleconsultation at least occasionally. However, 73% of programmes, mostly in non-urban areas, reported some limitations regarding clinicians' degree of ease with teleconferencing platforms and half of EIS could not access technical support to use them. The majority of EIS (94%) expressed interest to participate in a training program about the use of technologies for teleconsultations. Many smaller clinics reported interest in offering multiregional/multiclinics group teletherapy, therefore merging their pool of patients and clinical staff workforce. Further studies are warranted to improve access to and use of technology-mediated treatment, which seems to be a promising alternative to provide high-quality mental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Pires de Oliveira Padilha, Bertulies-Esposito, L'Heureux, Olivier, Lal, Abdel-Baki","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13227","20211009","COVID-19 pandemic; early intervention for psychosis; implementation; teleconsultation; telehealth; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18670,""
"Psychological impacts and online interventions of social isolation amongst older adults during COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review","To summarise the psychological impacts of social isolation amongst older adults during COVID-19 and review the benefits and limitations of online interventions used to combat social isolation. A scoping review was performed. A systematic search was performed from October 2020 to January 2021 in seven electronic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. A hand search of the reference lists of included papers and WHO publications was performed. Grey literature search was carried out from Scopus, ProQuest Dissertation and Google Scholar. Studies were screened, appraised and extracted independently by two reviewers. Thematic analysis was used to synthesise data, which were presented in a descriptive manner and organised into categories and themes. Totally, 33Ã‚Â studies were included. Four themes and eight sub-themes emerged: (1) negative impacts and experiences of older adults during social isolation, (2) adopting coping behaviours in the midst of COVID-19, (3) online interventions to combat the consequences of social isolation, (4) barriers to online intervention. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an emotional toll on older adults' psychological wellbeing and has highlighted the untapped strengths of older adults facing isolation. Online interventions, which could be a new normal in the COVID era, were beneficial in combating social isolation. Strategies by various stakeholders were recommended to tackle the barriers of online interventions. With the COVID-19 pandemic still in progress, this review provides insights on the psychological impacts of social isolation amongst older adults. Nurses in the community and long-term care facilities could adopt strategies and online intervention to better support the older adults, contribute to a stronger COVID-19 response and support system, and an overall better road to recovery from this crisis.","Rodrigues, Han, Su, Klainin-Yobas, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15063","20211009","COVID-19; mental health; nurse or nursing; older adults; online interventions; pandemic; psychological impact; quarantine; scoping review; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18671,""
"Prescription of anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics and antidepressants in outpatient, universal care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal: a nationwide, interrupted time-series approach","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the population's mental health. However, its impact on the consumption of anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics and antidepressants remains to be evaluated. Hence, this article aims to assess the prescription trends of these drugs in Portugal, from January 2018 to March 2021, while critically examining whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on these prescription trends or not. A nationwide interrupted time-series analysis of the prescription data of anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics and antidepressants in outpatient setting of the public health sector was conducted. The data encompassed the defined daily dose per month, age range and sex and were analysed following a segmented regression approach. The pandemic preceded an immediate reduction in the prescription of anxiolytics, sedatives and hypnotics for children and adolescents. However, an increasing trend throughout the pandemic has been noted in the prescription of these drugs, especially among adults aged 65 years or above. A drop in antidepressant prescription was observed as an immediate effect of the pandemic among male and female adolescents and elderly women. From March 2020 to March 2021, a decreasing prescription trend has been noted among men. When analysing specific genders and age ranges, differences can be noted, in terms of both immediate impact and prescribing trends throughout 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on mental health and its association with the consumption trends of psychoactive drugs, and with the access to mental health treatments, should be further assessed.","Estrela, Silva, Gomes, PiÃƒÂ±eiro, Figueiras, Roque, Herdeiro","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216732","20211009","COVID-19; mental health; pharmacoepidemiology; public health; time-series","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18672,""

Parental stress is a risk factor for hostile and less supportive parenting. Parenting styles are a set of attitudes, feelings and behaviors related to parenting that modulate the child's psychosocial functioning and might impact on the adaptability to a stressful time. To investigate the group differences among children raised by negative and positive parenting families during COVID-19 pandemic. We have done an online survey with 329 parents. Parents answer about parenting strategies and styles, children's behavior, Covid related questions, socio-economic information, sleep and gaming disorders. Parents' frequent use of negative strategies were a risk factor to have a negative outcome related to mental health, games, sleep, and children behavior. Parenting strategies are some targets pointed in this study for intervention. Parents' styles and strategies training to better manage children might be even more important to avoid negative consequences for children in stressful times.","Oliveira, Costa, Alvim-Soares, de Paula, Kestelman, Silva, Malloy-Diniz, Miranda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105345","20211009","Behavior problem; COVID-19 pandemic; Game addiction; Parenting; Sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18673,""
"Self-reported mental health symptoms, quality of life and coping strategies in French health sciences students during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic: An online survey","Health sciences students usually report high rates of mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic context may have serious psychological impacts in this at-risk population. We aimed to assess the self-reported mental health status, health-related quality of life and coping strategies of health sciences students during the early stage of the pandemic. An online 128-item questionnaire sent to 17,673 health sciences students from the Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 in April 2020 assessed: a) sociodemographic characteristics, b) conditions of lockdown, c) depressive (Beck Depression Inventory- Short Form, BDI-SF), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-A, STAI-A) and traumatic symptoms (Impact of Event Scale -Revised, IES-R), d) health-related quality of life (SF12) and e) coping strategies (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced, Brief COPE). The participation rate was 9.9% (n=1,765). A total of 19.5% of participants reported an IES-R&gt;33, 11.6% depressive symptoms, 58.1% anxiety symptoms, and 4.4% suicidal ideation. Their mental health-related quality of life was significantly poorer than for physical health. Female gender, COVID-like symptoms, social isolation due to the lockdown, pandemic-related financial restraint and exams-related stress were significantly associated with poorer self-reported mental health conditions. Volunteering in the healthcare system was significantly associated with lower mental health scores. Coping strategies were mostly oriented toward avoidance and positive appraisal. French health sciences students exhibited high levels of self-reported mental health problems and a poor mental health-related quality of life during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic social restrictions on individuals with autism spectrum disorder and their caregivers in the Stateof Qatar: A cross-sectional study","Previous research has established an association between changes to the daily routine of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and increase in maladaptive behaviours. The relationship between maladaptive behaviours in autistic individuals and increase in care burden among their caregivers is also well established. However, no study has yet examined these associations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on autistic individuals and their caregivers. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted with the caregivers of 58 autistic individuals across the mental health services at Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. The extent of care burden was measured using the Care Burden Interview, whereas changes in behaviour in autistic individuals was assessed using the Revised Overt Aggression Scale. A total of 58 caregivers participated in the study. Out of these, 24 (41 %) reported a clinically significant increase in their care burden. Among caregivers reporting an increase in care burden, two-third were caring for individuals whose behaviour either remained unchanged or improved during social restrictions. Nine autistic people (15.5 %) were reported to have no aggression prior to the implementation of COVID-19 social restrictions compared to 13 (22.4%) individuals during COVID-19 social restrictions. Minimal, mild and moderate aggression were reported in 27 (46.6 %), 21 (36.2 %), and 1 (1.7 %) patients respectively, before COVID-19 social restrictions compared to 29 (50 %), 15 (25.9), and 1 (1.7 %) during COVID-19 restrictions. Severe aggression was not reported in any patient either before or during COVID-19 social restrictions.

The current study was conducted to determine the health effects of teleworking during an emergency statement as evidence for future policy development. This was a cross-sectional study in which we administered an online questionnaire to 5,214 general workers (response rate = 36.4%) from June 2020 to August 2020. Based on working methods during the pandemic, workers were categorized into the office group (n = 86) and telework group (n = 1597), and we characterized their demographics, changes in lifestyle, telework status, physical symptoms, and mental health. The results showed that the workers' residence, marital status, management positions, and employee status affected the choice of the work method. During the emergency, teleworkers experienced more changes in their habits than office workers. In terms of exercise habits, 67.0% of the individuals belonging to the office-telework (OT) group exercised less. Approximately half of the teleworkers were satisfied with their telework, and those in the OT group were less satisfied with their telework than those in the telework-telework (TT) group, and they reported an increase in both working hours and meeting hours. Work-family conflict was more pronounced in the TT group than in the two other groups. Only 13.2% of individuals did not experience any stress in the past 30 days, and all three groups showed varying degrees of anxiety and depressive tendencies. In addition, all teleworkers experienced adverse physical symptoms before and after the emergency. Health issues associated with teleworking should be given adequate attention.","Niu, Nagata, Fukutani, Tezuka, Shimoura, Nagai-Tanima, Aoyama","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256530","20211008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18676,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Transit Workers: Perceptions of Employer Responses and Associations with Health Factors","COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on transit workers' lives, especially among public-facing vehicle operators. The current project examined relationships between workers' knowledge and perceptions of their employer's COVID-19 safety responses, job attitudes, and health. We surveyed transit workers (N = 174) between July and August 2020 and followed up 3 months later. Fifty-seven workers responded to the follow-up survey. Surveys addressed workers' knowledge and perceptions of their employer implementing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended COVID-19 safety responses, COVID-19 risk perceptions, job attitudes, and health factors. Employees reported knowledge of their employer implementing ~8 of 12 CDC-recommended responses. The most reported response was informational poster placements; the least reported was designating a point-person for COVID-19 concerns. Significant associations were found between knowledge of employer safety responses and lower COVID-19 risk perceptions, better job attitudes, and greater mental and global health. Operators (i.e. public-facing workers) reported worse perceptions of employer responses, and higher COVID-19 risk perceptions, work stress, and turnover intentions, compared with non-operators. A time-lagged panel model found that COVID-19 risk perceptions significantly mediated the relationship between public-facing work status and follow-up depression, anxiety, stress, and global health. Results reveal opportunities for transit authorities to broaden and better communicate their responses to emergent occupational safety and health crises.","Rice, Greenspan, Bauer, Rimby, Bodner, Olson","https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxab080","20211008","COVID-19 risk perceptions; employer COVID-19 safety practices; occupational safety and health; safety communication; transit workers; transportation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18677,""
"Death Anxiety Associated With Coronavirus (COVID-19) Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Death anxiety is a feeling that exists since birth, continues throughout life, lies at the root of all fears, and develops after the awareness that people will no longer exist and that they can lose themselves and the world. It is associated with death-induced anxiety with many features of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be seen as a threat to human existence. In this study, it is aimed to compile studies on death anxiety associated with coronavirus disease, list the general characteristics of these studies through descriptive summaries, and combine findings on the level of death anxiety associated with coronavirus disease through meta-analysis.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on mental health services: the provider perspective","The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on mental health of populations is in focus recently but few studies focus on service adaptations to ensure care provision for the mentally ill. In India, where community-based mental healthcare is led by non-government organizations (NGOs), this is a crucial time to gather evidence on how these organizations adapted to the challenges. We explored provider perspectives in an NGO providing mental health services to communities using in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion to understand the impact on services and adaptations during the COVID 19 pandemic. Three elements of service provision were highlighted: established relationships with communities, responsiveness to the patient needs, and resilience in ensuring continuity. Responding to the end-to-end care needs of the clients and continual adaptations were vital for ensuring continued services. Telemedicine enabled expansion of service and clientele as well as efficiency, but there were issues of casualization of therapy and poor privacy. The study provides an understanding of adaptations to ensure continuity of care to mentally ill during disruptions. Insights from strategies are crucial to help plan for resilient community-based mental health care services.","Nair, Kannan, Mehta, Raju, Mathew, Ramachandran","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab163","20211008","communities; health services; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18679,""
"Adapting the Delivery of Functional Family Therapy Around the World During a Global Pandemic","This paper describes accommodations that were implemented to support the global delivery of Functional Family Therapy (FFT) in community-based settings during COVID-19. FFT is an evidence-based family therapy that has been used with youth and families in juvenile justice, child welfare, mental health, and school settings. FFT LLC, an organization that disseminates FFT into community settings, currently supports over 350 community-based agencies that deliver FFT globally. Using the implementation framework articulated by Fixsen et al. (Implementation research: a synthesis of the literature, University of South Florida, Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute, The National Implementation Research Network, 2005), this paper describes key sets of implementation drivers (i.e., competency, organizational, and leadership) that facilitated the accommodations made to meet the challenge of maintaining fidelity to FFT as training and clinical services were transitioned to online platforms. To evaluate if accommodations were associated with fidelity and outcomes, descriptive information about treatment delivery and basic outcomes (e.g., therapist fidelity to model, youth behavioral outcomes) from March 15, 2020, to September 1, 2020 were compared to the same period from 2019. During 2020, FFT LLC supported therapists who served over 11,000 families and conducted over 35,000 tele-sessions with families. Overall, results showed similar completion rates (79% vs. 75%), therapist fidelity (3.77 vs. 3.94), and therapist-reported outcomes in 2019 and 2020 (respectively), suggesting that delivering the FFT model can be implemented with fidelity using teletherapy formats.","Robbins, Midouhas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s43477-021-00009-0","20211009","Family therapy; Implementation; International; Pandemic; Tele-sessions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18680,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on people ageing with an intellectual disability in Ireland: Protocol for a follow-up survey","<b>Background</b>:Ã‚ The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have had a dramatic impact on many people, but individuals with an intellectual disability, given the prevalence of congregate living and high levels of co-morbid conditions, may be particularly vulnerable at this time. A prior initial survey of participants of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA) found that, despite a majority of participants being tested, only a small proportion had tested positive for COVID-19. Furthermore, despite some reporting positive aspects to the lockdown, a similar proportion were experiencing stress or anxiety during the pandemic. The pandemic and lockdowns have continued, and it is possible that experiences and consequences have changed over time. <b>Aim</b>: To explore over time and in greater depth the impact of COVID-19 and associated lockdowns and to further establish rates of infection, rates of vaccination and participants' experiences. <b>Methods</b>: A structured questionnaire for people with intellectual disability participating in the IDS-TILDA longitudinal study, to be administered by telephone/video in summer 2021. Where participants are unable to respond independently, a proxy respondent will be invited to either assist the participant or answer questions on their behalf. This questionnaire will include questions from the first COVID-19 questionnaire, with extra questions assessing ""long COVID"" (i.e. COVID-19 lasting for 12 weeks or longer), infection control behaviours, changes in mental health, social contacts and loneliness, frailty, healthcare, and incidence of vaccination. <b>Impact</b>: The results of this survey will be used to inform healthcare provision for people with intellectual disability during the latter stages of the lockdown and into the future.","McCarron, Allen, McCausland, Haigh, Luus, Bavussantakath, Sheerin, Mulryan, Burke, McGlinchey, Flannery, McCallion","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13340.1","20211009","COVID-19; frailty; healthcare; intellectual disability; lockdown; mental health; social participation; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18681,""
"The role of sociodemographics, behavioral factors, and internet use behaviors in students' psychological health amid COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic drastically impacted students' psychological well-being by interchanging their regular activities. Students are more engaged with online activities, which may affect their mental health. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the magnitude of psychological health of the Bangladeshi students, where the role of online use behaviors is also investigated. An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 7 October 2020 and 2 November, 2020 among Bangladeshi students utilizing a convenience sampling technique. The survey questionnaire included items concerning sociodemographics, behavior and health-related variables, online use behaviors, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present the data (i.e., binary logistic regression was performed to examine the association between variables and hierarchical regression analysis was performed to predict the variance for depression and anxiety). Out of 601 included students, 260 and 196 students reported the symptoms of depression (43.3%) and anxiety (32.6%), respectively, where female students experienced a higher level of psychological problems. The psychological suffering was also significantly associated with medical college students, having an affair, less sleep time, not performing physical exercise, excessive internet use, and not watching news during online activities. After adjusting all of the studied variables in the hierarchical regression models, it explained 10% and 9.6% variance of depression and anxiety, respectively. During this pandemic situation, a relatively higher level of psychological complications was observed among the Bangladeshi students. Regrettably, any specific policy was absent in the country to assuage that outcome. Therefore, based on the study finding, a few strategies and policies were recommended that may be helpful to alleviate psychological issues among the students.","Hosen, Al Mamun, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.398","20211009","Bangladeshi students; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; anxiety; depression; internet use behaviors; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18682,""
"Prevalence and impact of the use of electronic gadgets on the health of children in secondary schools in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study","Use of technological gadgets has rapidly been increasing among adolescents, which may result in health issues and technology addiction. This study focuses on the prevalence of usage of technological gadgets and health-related complications among secondary school-going children of Bangladesh. A total of 1803 secondary school students from 21 different districts of Bangladesh participated in the study. The children were asked questions relating to their access to electronic gadgets, time spent on outdoor activities, and whether they experienced any health-complications as an after-effect of the usage. A binary logistic regression model was adapted considering time spent on gadgets as an independent variable and health problems (physical and mental) as the dependent variable. Among all the gadgets, 67.11% of the participants were reported to use mobile phones on a daily basis. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 24.48% of respondents used electronic gadgets for attending online classes. The participants were reported to use gadgets significantly more (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) in 2020 as compared to 2019. Children showed less tendency to spend time in outdoor activities. More than 50% of the participants spend time doing outdoor activities for less than 1 hour daily. An association between gadget use and health problems like headache, backache, visual disturbance, and sleeping disturbance has been observed in our study. This study demonstrates that different socio-demographic factors have influence on the use of gadgets by children, and this use has greatly been affecting both the physical and mental health of the secondary school-going students of Bangladesh.","Rashid, Mawah, Banik, Akter, Deen, Jahan, Khan, Rahman, Lipi, Akter, Paul, Mannan","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.388","20211009","Bangladesh; gadgets; health complications; secondary school students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18683,""

"Coping, resilience, and emotional well-being in pharmacy students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this study was to investigate the significant contributions of coping, resilience, personal characteristics, and health behaviors on the emotional well-being of pharmacy students during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 was identified in December 2019 and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Pharmacy students may experience greater stress during this outbreak because of interruptions in classes or rotations, concerns regarding personal or family health, and social isolation from peers. These changes may result in behavior shifts, difficulty concentrating, and increased use of negative coping strategies. The extent to which these factors affect overall student well-being during a pandemic is largely unknown. A cross-sectional study of 3 colleges of pharmacy was completed during May to July 2020 via an online, anonymous 64-item questionnaire using REDCap software. Linear regression and descriptive statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 26. Using the enter method, levels of coping strategies, personal resilience, and Hispanic ethnic identity explain 29% of the variance in emotional well-being scores in pharmacy students during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>F</i> (2,76)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.785, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.000, R<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.317<i>, R<sup>2</sup></i> <sup>adjusted</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.291). For this sample (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°104), higher levels of resilience, greater use of coping strategies, and identifying as Hispanic were significant predictors of emotional well-being. Student mental health continues to be important, especially during crises and pandemics. Therefore, pharmacy programs should cultivate an environment that supports the emotional well-being of their students. Campus-based initiatives may be needed to encourage healthy coping behaviors and bolster students' personal resilience to better prepare them for providing front-line patient care in the future.","Fuentes, Jacobs, Ip, Owens, Caballero","https://doi.org/10.9740/mhc.2021.09.274","20211009","COVID-19; coping; emotional well-being; mental health; pharmacy student; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18685,""
"What are the long-term symptoms and complications of COVID-19: a protocol for a living systematic review","Although the majority of patients with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and will recover fully, there is now increasing evidence that a significant proportion will experience persistent symptoms for weeks or months after the acute phase of the illness. These symptoms include, among others, fatigue, problems in breathing, lack of smell and taste, headaches, and also depression and anxiety. It has also become clear that the virus has lasting effects not only on the respiratory system but also on other parts of the body, including the heart, liver, and the nervous system. In this paper we present a protocol for a living systematic review that aims to synthesize the evidence on the prevalence and duration of symptoms and clinical features of post-acute COVID-19 and its long-term complications. The living systematic review will be updated regularly, initially monthly with update cycles under continuous review as the pace of new evidence generated develops through the pandemic. We will include studies that follow up with COVID-19 patients who have experienced persistent mild, moderate or severe symptoms, with no restrictions regarding country, setting, or language. We will use descriptive statistics to analyse the data and our findings will be presented as infographics to facilitate transcription to lay audiences. Ultimately, we aim to support the work of policy makers, practitioners, and patients when planning rehabilitation for those recovering from COVID-19.

"The mediating role of COVID-19-related burden in the association between adverse childhood experiences and emotional exhaustion: results of the egePan - VOICE study","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase the risk for mental health problems. However, there is a lack of data targeting the role of ACEs for one of the most prevalent mental health problems in health-care professionals: burnout. We aimed to assess the relationship between ACEs and the core burnout dimension 'emotional exhaustion' (EE). As health-care professionals have been facing particular challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, we furthermore aimed to assess the role of COVID-19 associated burden in the interplay between ACEs and EE. During the first lockdown in Germany, a total of 2500 medical healthcare professionals were questioned in a cross-sectional online survey. Questions targeted, among others, sociodemographics, ACEs, COVID-19-associated problems (e.g. increase of workload, worries about relatives and patients) and emotional exhaustion, measured by the respective dimension of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). In German health-care professionals, ACEs were associated with a higher EE score. The number of experienced ACEs was associated with the majority of assessed COVID-19-associated problems. An increasing number of ACEs predicted higher EE scores, controlling for gender. The association between ACEs and EE was mediated significantly by COVID-19-associated problems. These included maladaptive coping strategies such as increased smoking, drinking and use of antidepressants/tranquilizers, feeling less protected by measures of the employee or the state, a greater feeling of being burdened by COVID-19-associated problems and greater exhaustion and sleep problems. Our findings suggest ACEs as significant risk factor for EE in German health-care professionals. The current pandemic means a significant burden that further pronounces this risk. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Las experiencias adversas en la niÃƒÂ±ez (ACEs en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) aumentan el riesgo de problemas de salud mental. Sin embargo, faltan datos sobre el papel de las ACEs en uno de los problemas de salud mental mÃƒÂ¡s prevalentes en los profesionales de la salud: el agotamiento (burnout).<b>Objetivo</b>: Nuestro objetivo fue evaluar la relaciÃƒÂ³n entre las ACEs y la dimensiÃƒÂ³n central del agotamiento Ã¢â‚¬Ëœagotamiento emocionalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (AE). Dado que los profesionales de la salud se han enfrentado a desafÃƒÂ­os particulares durante la pandemia de COVID-19, ademÃƒÂ¡s nos propusimos evaluar el papel de la carga asociada a COVID-19 en la interacciÃƒÂ³n entre las ACEs y la AE.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos</b>: Durante la primera cuarentena en Alemania, se interrogÃƒÂ³ a un total de 2500 profesionales de la salud en una encuesta transversal en lÃƒÂ­nea. Las preguntas fueron dirigidas, entre otros, a datos sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficos, ACEs, problemas asociados a COVID-19 (por ejemplo, aumento de la carga de trabajo, preocupaciones sobre familiares y pacientes) y agotamiento emocional, medidos por la dimensiÃƒÂ³n respectiva del Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI).<b>Resultados</b>: En los profesionales sanitarios alemanes, las ACEs se asociaron con una puntuaciÃƒÂ³n de AE mÃƒÂ¡s alta. El nÃƒÂºmero de ACEs experimentados se asociÃƒÂ³ con la mayorÃƒÂ­a de los problemas asociados a COVID-19 evaluados. Un mayor nÃƒÂºmero de ACEs predijo puntuaciones de AE mÃƒÂ¡s altas, controlado por gÃƒÂ©nero. La asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre ACEs y AE fue mediada significativamente por problemas asociados con COVID-19. Estos incluyeron estrategias de afrontamiento desadaptativas, como fumar, beber y usar antidepresivos/tranquilizantes, sentirse menos protegido por las medidas del empleador o el estado, una mayor sensaciÃƒÂ³n de estar agobiado por los problemas asociados con COVID-19 y un mayor agotamiento y problemas de sueÃƒÂ±o.<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n</b>: Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que las ACEs son un factor de riesgo significativo para la AE en los profesionales de la salud alemanes.

"Interpersonal violence: Serious sequelae for heart disease in women","Experiencing various forms of violence in either childhood or adulthood has been associated with cardiovascular disease, both shortly after the event and during follow-up, particularly in women. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has heightened the risk of domestic violence with serious sequelae for mental and cardiovascular health in women, possibly due to several contributing factors, ranging from lockdown, stay at home regulations, job losses, anxiety, and stress. Accordingly, it remains paramount to enforce proactive preventive strategies, at both the family and individual level, maintain a high level of attention to recognize all forms of violence or abuse, and guarantee a multidisciplinary team approach for victims of interpersonal or domestic violence in order to address physical, sexual, and emotional domains and offer a personalized care.","Mazza, Marano, Gonsalez Del Castillo, Chieffo, Albano, Biondi-Zoccai, Galiuto, Sani, Romagnoli","https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v13.i9.438","20211009","COVID-19; Cardiovascular disease; Depression; Personalized medicine; Violence; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18689,""
"Treatment satisfaction and its association with anxiety, depression and fear of COVID-19 among Lebanese inpatients with schizophrenia","The patient's evaluation of treatment and its associated outcomes define the treatment satisfaction. The quality of treatment satisfaction and healthcare service has been affected by depression, anxiety and fear of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to assess factors associated with treatment satisfaction among Lebanese inpatients with schizophrenia, namely depression, anxiety and fear of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September and November 2020, enrolled 118 patients with chronic schizophrenia consecutively admitted to Psychiatric Hospital of the Cross, Lebanon. The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction-Patient Satisfaction Scale (FACIT-TS-PS) was used to assess treatment satisfaction, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale -10 (LAS-10) was used to assess anxiety, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to assess depression and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale to assess the level of fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean scores of the scales were as follows: treatment satisfaction (65.20; SD 16.11; median=71), LAS-10 (13.65; SD 6.02), MADRS (9.09; SD 6.69) and fear of COVID-19 (18.59; SD 6.78). Higher depression (r= -0.46, p&lt;0.001) was significantly associated with lower treatment satisfaction. Female gender (beta=7.51, p=0.029) was significantly associated with higher treatment satisfaction score. Fear of COVID-19 did not show any significant association with the treatment satisfaction score. Results of this study found that depression and gender were associated with treatment satisfaction among inpatients with schizophrenia. No association has been found between fear of COVID-19 and treatment satisfaction among those patients. More research is warranted to evaluate treatment satisfaction and associated factors among chronic inpatients with schizophrenia, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to improve treatment satisfaction and subjective well-being of patients.","Bitar, Haddad, Obeid, Hallit","https://doi.org/10.18549/PharmPract.2021.3.2364","20211009","Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Epidemiologic Factors; Fear; Inpatients; Lebanon; Multivariate Analysis; Patient Satisfaction; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18690,""
"The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the mental health of hemodialysis patients in Lebanon","Hemodialysis is a necessary treatment for end-stage kidney disease patients. It imposes undergoing three sessions of dialysis per week in a specialized center. Amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, precautionary measures were mandatory in all dialysis facilities and may have negatively impacted patients' well-being. This study aimed to uncover the scale of this effect. We performed a cross-sectional study of all patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in two dialysis units (one urban and another rural). Patients with Alzheimer's disease were excluded. Patients filled a questionnaire including information on socio-demographics, factors related to the dialysis facility, and the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on their mental health. A total of 72 patients responded. Their median age was 70 (60.79) years. Of them, 68% were males, 71% were married, and 10% were living alone. Following the pandemic, 35% felt more anxious, with a higher incidence of anxiety in the rural unit (p=0.021). Half of them felt very limited in their relationships, and 29% were isolated from their families. In total, 98% of patients were satisfied with the staff support. The imposed preventive measures were perceived as very strict in 27% of the surveyed patients. The majority of the urban group were bothered for not eating during the session, and they felt significantly more stress than the rural group (p=0.001). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic increased anxiety among hemodialysis patients from a rural setting. Stress was more prevalent in the urban group and most probably related to limitations in eating during sessions. The majority were satisfied with staff support.","Beaini, Aoun, El Hajj, Sleilaty, Haber, Maalouf, Abi Rached","https://doi.org/10.25122/jml-2020-0165","20211009","COVID-19; hemodialysis; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18691,""

"Match-Fixing Causing Harm to Athletes on a COVID-19-Influenced Gambling Market: A Call for Research During the Pandemic and Beyond","Match-fixing, although not a new problem, has received growing attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been reported in the media to have increased the risk of match-fixing events. Gambling is a well-documented addictive behavior, and gambling-related fraud, match-fixing, is a challenge to the world of sports. Most research on match-fixing has a judicial or institutional perspective, and few studies focus on its individual consequences. Nevertheless, athletes may be at particular risk of mental health consequences from the exposure to or involvement in match-fixing. The COVID-19 crisis puts a spotlight on match-fixing, as the world of competitive sports shut down or changed substantially due to pandemic-related restrictions. We call for research addressing individual mental health and psycho-social correlates of match-fixing, and their integration into research addressing problem gambling, related to the pandemic and beyond.","HÃƒÂ¥kansson, JÃƒÂ¶nsson, KenttÃƒÂ¤","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.712300","20211009","COVID-19; athletes mental health; behavioral addiction; crime; gambling; match-fixing; problem gambling; sport psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18693,""
"Mental Health in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Meta-Review of Prevalence Meta-Analyses","<b>Background:</b> Mental health burden has been massively reported during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Aiming to summarise these data, we present a meta-review of meta-analyses that evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms, psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder/symptoms (PTSD), and sleep disturbance, reporting its prevalence on general public (GP) and health care workers (HCW). <b>Methods:</b> A search was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science. Sleep disturbances, psychological distress, stress, and burnout were grouped as ""Psychophysiological stress,"" and anxiety, depression, and PTSD were grouped as ""Psychopathology."" A random-effects model, calculating the pooled prevalence together with 95% confidence interval was performed for each domain. Subgroup analyses were performed for each population type (GP and HCW) and for each mental health outcome. For anxiety and depression, subgroup analysis for population type was performed. Heterogeneity is reported as <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>. Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of the funnel plot, and further tested by Egger's test and trim and fill analyses. <b>Results:</b> A total of 18 meta-analyses were included. The prevalence of psychophysiological stress was 31.99% (CI: 26.88-37.58, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.9%). HCW showed a higher prevalence (37.74%, CI: 33.26-42.45, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.7%) than the GP (20.67%, 15.07-27.66, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.9%). The overall prevalence of insomnia, psychological distress, and stress were, respectively, 32.34% (CI: 25.65-39.84), 28.25% (CI: 18.12-41.20), and 36% (CI: 29.31-43.54). Psychopathology was present at 26.45% (CI: 24.22-28.79, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.9%) of the sample, with similar estimates for population (HCW 26.14%, CI: 23.37-29.12, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.9%; GP: 26.99%, CI: 23.41-30.9, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.9%). The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD was 27.77% (CI: 24.47-31.32), 26.93% (CI: 23.92-30.17), and 20% (CI: 15.54-24.37), respectively. Similar proportions between populations were found for anxiety (HCW = 27.5%, CI: 23.78-31.55; GP = 28.33%, CI: 22.1-35.5) and depression (HCW = 27.05%, CI: 23.14-31.36; GP = 26.7%, CI: 22.32-31.59). Asymmetry in the funnel plot was found, and a slight increase in the estimate of overall psychopathology (29.08%, CI: 26.42-31.89) was found after the trim and fill analysis. <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of mental health problems ranged from 20 to 36%.

"Effects of Coronavirus-19 Induced Loneliness on Mental Health: Sleep Quality and Intolerance for Uncertainty as Mediators","<b>Objective:</b> The aim of the study is to investigate effects of loneliness on individual's mental health and the mediating effects of intolerance of uncertainty and sleep quality in the post Coronavirus-19 period, especially for the young people. <b>Methods:</b> The questionnaires used in this study include UCLA loneliness scale (UCLA-3), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), intolerance for uncertainty (IU) and the Chinese version of DASS-21. A total number of 289 subjects were recruited in the study, which includes 209 females (72.3%), 80 males (27.7%); and 212 students (73.4%), 77 working staffs (26.6%). <b>Results:</b> The results showed that: (1) people have high levels of loneliness, anxiety, depression and stress, and poor sleep quality; (2) the mediating effect of intolerance for uncertainty in the relationship of loneliness and mental health is significant (effect size = 0.178, 95% CI confidence interval: [0.115, 0.241]), and the mediating effects of sleep quality in the relationship between loneliness and mental health is significant (effect size = 0.127, 95% CI confidence interval: [0.017, 0.239]). <b>Conclusion:</b> Loneliness invokes a stronger self-concerned inadaptability to threat response and may lead to more mental diseases through more serious intolerance for uncertainty and insomnia.","Gu, He, Sun, Jiang, Xu, Feng, Ma, Wang, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.738003","20211009","COVID-19; intolerance for uncertainty; loneliness; mental health; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18695,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Sleep in Autistic Adults: Longitudinal Comparisons pre and During Lockdown","<b>Background:</b> The longer-term impact of the pandemic on autistic adults' sleep are yet to be revealed, with studies concentrating on sleep in autistic children or mental health outcomes and coping strategies of autistic adults. Given the prevalence of sleep problems experienced by autistic adults and the changes in routine that have occurred as a result of COVID-19 societal restrictions, this study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep problems via a longitudinal subjective assessment method. <b>Methods:</b> Sleep data were gathered at three time points from 95 autistic adults, namely prior to the pandemic, at the start of COVID-19 and several months into COVID-19 to obtain a rich longitudinal dataset ascertaining how/if sleep patterns have changed in autistic adults over these several months. <b>Results:</b> In comparison to pre-lockdown, several sleep components were shown to improve during the lockdown. These improvements included reduced sleep latency (time taken to fall asleep), longer sleep duration, improved sleep efficiency, improved sleep quality, as well as improved daytime functioning. Pre-sleep cognitive arousal scores were found to decrease compared to pre-lockdown, meaning cognitive arousal improved. Approximately 65% of participants reported that they felt their sleep had been impacted since COVID-19 since Time 1, with the most common reasons reported as waking up exhausted (36.92%), not being able to get to sleep (33.85%), waking up in the night (29.23%), having a disrupted sleep pattern (27.69%), and nightmares (18.46%). <b>Conclusions:</b> Improvements in sleep may be related to societal changes (e.g., working from home) during the pandemic. Some of these changes are arguably beneficial for autistic adults in creating a more autism-inclusive society, for example telehealth opportunities for care. Further exploration of the associations between mental health and sleep are warranted.","Halstead, Sullivan, Dimitriou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708339","20211009","COVID-19; adults; autism; pandemic; pre-sleep arousal; sleep; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18696,""
"Cost-effectiveness of 'screen-and-treat' interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder following major incidents","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly experienced in the aftermath of major incidents such as terrorism and pandemics. Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening and evidence-based interventions (a 'screen-and-treat' approach), but little is known about its cost-effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to report the first systematic attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach. A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared with treatment-as-usual, the latter involving identification of PTSD by general practitioners and referral to psychological therapy services. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was run over a 5-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 exposed adults from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services in England. The incremental cost per QALY gained was Ã‚Â£7931. This would be considered cost-effective 88% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of Ã‚Â£20 000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this result was robust. A screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in adults following terrorist attacks appears cost-effective in England compared with treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes. Although this finding was in the context of terrorism, the implications might be translatable into other major incident-related scenarios including the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Hogan, Knapp, McDaid, Davies, Brewin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049472","20211008","COVID-19; health economics; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18697,""
"Quality of life and associated factors among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) and determine its association with various factors and social support among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic after the end of movement lockdown. This online cross-sectional study recruited 316 participants. The inclusion criteria were students 18 years and above who were registered with the faculties of medicine at Malaysian public universities located in Klang Valley and in the states of Penang and Kelantan in Peninsular Malaysia. The exclusion criteria were those who presented with psychotic disorders, bipolar mood disorder or a history of illicit drugs. Participants were administered a self-reported questionnaire to gather data on demographic, personal, clinical and psychological characteristics. The questionnaire comprised of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the WHO Quality of Life- Brief Version (WHOQoL-BREF). The psychological and social QoL scores were lower than the non-pandemic norms of the general population, while the physical health and environmental QoL scores were comparable. After adjusting for relevant demographic, personal and clinical variables, religious coping, greater number of hours of online classes attended, and greater social support from family, friends and significant others were significantly associated with higher QoL among the participants. Frustration due to study disruption, living in areas with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, and a higher severity of depressive and stress symptoms were significantly associated with lower QoL. COVID-19 impaired the QoL of university students even after the movement lockdown was lifted.","Leong Bin Abdullah, Mansor, Mohamad, Teoh","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048446","20211008","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18698,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the practice of breast pathologists: a survey of breast pathologists in the UK and Ireland","There is little information on the impact of COVID-19 on breast pathologists. This survey assessed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK and Ireland-based breast pathologists to optimise working environments and ensure preparedness for potential future pandemics. A 35-question survey during the first wave of COVID-19 infections in the UK including questions on workload, working practices, professional development, training, health and safety and well-being was distributed to consultant breast pathologists and responses collected anonymously. There were 135 responses from breast pathologists based in the UK and Ireland. Most participants (75.6%) stated that their workload had decreased and their productivity dropped. 86/135 (63.7%) were given the option of working from home and 36% of those who did reported improved efficiency. Multidisciplinary team meetings largely moved to virtual platforms (77.8%) with fewer members present (41.5%). Online education, including webinars and courses, was utilised by 92.6%. 16.3% of pathologists reported shortages of masks, visors or gowns as the the most common health and safety concern. COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on the physical and mental health of 33.3% of respondents. A small number of pathologists (10.4%) were redeployed and/or retrained. The UK and Ireland breast pathologists adapted to the rapid change and maintained service delivery despite the significant impact of the pandemic on their working practices and mental health. It is important to apply flexible working patterns and environments that improve productivity and well-being. The changes suggested should be considered for long-term shaping of breast pathology services.","Elghobashy, Wahab, Gunavardhan, O'Sullivan, Provenzano, Deb, Pritchard, Di Palma, Ellis, Boyd, Pinder, Shaaban","https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2021-207725","20211008","COVID-19; breast; hospital; pathology department","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18699,""
"Emotional burden and care of adults with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazilian regions","This study investigated the emotional burden in persons with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazilian regions and evaluated which COVID-19, sociodemographic/clinical characteristics are related to it. In a cross-sectional study, T1D adults completed a web-based survey from May to July 2020. We collected sociodemographic/clinical data, and participants answered COVID-19 related questions. Diabetes burnout was evaluated by Diabetes burnout scale. Type 1 Diabetes scale assessed Diabetes Distress and PHQ-8 measured depressive symptoms. DD and DS levels were similar in all Brazilian regions. DB was higher in Central-West/North/Northeast. Higher DB was associated with females, lower-income, higher HbA1c, and shorter time since T1D diagnosis. Predictors of experiencing higher levels of DD included: difficulty access to safe places to exercise, participants without a partner, male gender, young age, and higher HbA1c. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with difficulty to access diabetes supplies, and higher HbA1c (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The mean levels of DB, DD, and DS were high in all Brazilian regions. A great number of PWT1D had their diabetes care impaired and relied on family as their main support during the pandemic. The subgroups identified at risk should be prioritized in mental health support.","Silveira, Pavin, Cardoso, Fanti, Abdoli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2021.108053","20211008","COVID-19 pandemic; Depressive symptoms; Diabetes burnout; Diabetes care; Diabetes distress; Diabetes outcomes; Type 1 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18700,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being of people living with a long-term physical health condition: a qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions caused major global disruption. Individuals with long-term physical health conditions (LTCs) are at higher risk of severe illness and often subject to the strictest pandemic guidance, so may be disproportionally affected. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore how living with a LTC during the COVID-19 pandemic affected people's mental health and wellbeing. Participants were people living with LTCs who participated in telephone/video call interviews based on a semi-structured topic guide. Key themes and subthemes were determined using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. The sample included 32 participants with LTCs (most commonly cancer, respiratory conditions or cardiovascular diseases), mean age 57 (SD 13) years, 66% female and 72% white British. There were four overarching themes specific to living with a LTC. These were 1) high levels of fear and anxiety related to perceived consequences of catching COVID-19, 2) impact of shielding/isolation on mental health and wellbeing, 3) experience of healthcare during the pandemic and 4) anxiety created by uncertainty about the future. Fourteen subthemes were identified, including concerns about accessing essential supplies and the importance of social support. Individuals who lived alone and were advised to shield could be profoundly negatively affected. This study found that there were a number of aspects of living with a LTC during the pandemic that had a significant impact on mental health and well-being. There should be focus on how best to provide practical and social support to people with LTCs during a pandemic, particularly if they have to shield or isolate.","Fisher, Roberts, McKinlay, Fancourt, Burton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11751-3","20211008","Chronic disease; Interview; Mental health; Pandemics; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18701,""
"Latent profile analysis of mental health among Chinese healthcare staff during the COVID-19 pandemic","The mental health of individuals has become increasingly important during the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Given the number of healthcare staff that are helping to treat the victims of COVID-19 all over the world, there is a lack of research concerning the mental health of healthcare staff, and of the prior studies carried out, the research has been relatively descriptive and has not used more sophisticated types of analyses (e.g. latent profile analysis [LPA]). The aim of the present study was to investigate profiles of mental health among Chinese healthcare staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample comprised of 456 healthcare staff, and participants completed an online survey including individual information and their working status during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey included the Chinese Mental Health Scale (MHS-C), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Utilizing the LPA, two profiles of mental health (good mental health and poor mental health) were identified for Chinese healthcare staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to those with a good mental health profile, those with poor mental health profile had significantly higher scores on SAS and SDS. Female healthcare staff had higher mental health disturbances than males. Taking care and protecting the mental health of healthcare staff is very important in the fight against COVID-19. The need for employers to implement positive and effective measures among mental healthcare staff is likely to help them to cope better with mental health issues and improve mental health, as well as enhance resilience. Healthcare staff with good mental health can dedicate themselves to better nursing practice and nursing education during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Li, Niu, Li, Griffiths, Mei, Jiang, Deng, Xin","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1990364","20211008","COVID-19; Chinese healthcare staff; Mental health; anxiety; depression; latent profile analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18702,""
"[Psychological and behavioral functioning of children and adolescents during long-term home-schooling]","<b>Objective:</b> To study the characteristics and risk factors of psychological and behavioral problems of children and adolescents of different ages and genders in long-term home-schooling during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. Further, to provide scientific basis for more targeted psychological intervention and coping strategies in the future. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted on students aged 6-16 years old in five representative cities of North (Beijing), East (Shanghai), West (Chongqing), South (Guangzhou) and Middle (Wuhan) in China. In this study, the social behavior and psychological abnormalities which was defined as the positive of any dimension were investigated in multiple dimensions during long-term home-schooling. The influencing factors of psycho-behavioral problems were analyzed by Logistic regression, and the confounding factors were corrected with graded multivariable adjustment. <b>Results:</b> A total of 6 906 valid questionnaires were collected including 3 592 boys and 3 314 girls, of whom 3 626 were children (6-11 years old) and 3 280 were adolescents (12-16 years old). The positive detection rate of psychosocial-behavioral problems were 13.0% (900/6 906) totally, 9.6% (344/3 592) in boys and 16.8% (556/3 314) in girls respectively, and 7.3%(142/1 946) in boys aged 6-11, 14.0%(235/1 680) in girls aged 6-11, 12.3%(202/1 646) in boys aged 12-16, 19.6%(321/1 634) in girls aged 12-16 respectively. There were significant differences between the psychological problems group and the non-psychological problems group in gender, parent-offspring conflict, number of close friends, family income change, sedentary time, homework time, screen exposure time, physical activity, dietary problems (Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â²=78.851, 285.264, 52.839, 26.284, 22.778, 11.024, 10.688, 36.814, 70.982, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The most common symptoms in boys aged 6-11 years were compulsive activity, schizoid and depression, in girls aged 6-11 years were schizoid/compulsive activity, hyperactivity and social withdrawal, in boys aged 12-16 years were hyperactivity, compulsive activity and aggressive behavior, and in girls aged 12-16 years were schizoid, anxiety/compulsive activity and depression/withdrawal, respectively. After graded multivariable adjustment, besides the common risk factors, homework time and online study time were the risk factors of 6-11 years old groups [boys <i>OR</i>(95%<i>CI</i>): 1.750 (1.32-2.32), 1.214(1.00-1.47), girls: 1.579(1.25-1.99), 1.222(1.05-1.42), all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05], videogames time were the risk factors of 12-16 years old groups [ boys: 2.237 (1.60-3.13), girls: 1.272 (1.00-1.61), all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05]. <b>Conclusions:</b> Some children and adolescents may have psychological and behavioral problems during long-term home-schooling. The psychological and behavioral manifestations differed in age and gender subgroups, which deserve special attention in each subgroups. Schools, families and specialists should actively provide precise psychological support and comprehensive intervention strategies according to special features and risk factors.

"Exploring health impact and safety measures against transmission of COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia","The pandemic of Covid-19 at the global level cannot be underestimated. Arab world including Saudi Arabia is affected with the pandemic of Covid-19. More importantly, the surge of the numbers of infected individuals in Iran has brought fear and anxiety in the whole region in general and Saudi Arabia in particular. Several studies have investigated the prevalence of the virus in different countries from various perspectives. Nonetheless, little focus is given to academic research on health challenge of the virus resulting to fear and anxiety in the recent time in the context of Saudi Arabia. This study primarily aims at exploring the health effect of Covid-19 in Saudi Arabia despite the fact that, the World Health Organization (WHO) has clamored for preventive measures in addressing global health effect of the virus. The methodology of the study is systematic literature review (SLR) and content analysis of the secondary data on health impact of Covid-19 and preventive measures against its transmission in the country are critically analyzed. The results of secondary data of the study indicated that a number of confirmed cases, active cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia manifested negative impact of Covid-19 on citizens' health especially fear and anxiety despite the fact that records have showed steady recovered cases in the country. More specifically, the findings indicated that, health impact of Covid-19 are as follows namely: fear or anxiety, negative attitude among health workers and women in health workforce. Similarly, Saudi Arabia has put in place various preventive measures such as: preventive measures against transmission of Covid-19 which are as follows: institutional preparedness and strengthening mechanism, curfews and lockdowns and suspension of activities and order of social distancing. In conclusion, this paper has lucidly highlighted the health effect of Covid-19 and safety measures against the transmission of Covid-19 have been elaborated in the context of Saudi Arabia. It is thereby suggested that, the outcome of this study can be helpful to the health workers and policymakers in the country to be acquainted with the magnanimity of the novel coronavirus as well as putting effective safety mechanisms in place in curtailing the spread of Covid-19 in Saudi Arabia.","Hassan, Amuda, Chikhaoui, Dhali","https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2440","20211008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18704,""
"Are there protective associations between family/shared meal routines during COVID-19 and dietary health and emotional well-being in diverse young adults?","Background This study examined who is engaging in family/shared meals and associations between family/shared meal frequency and home food availability, dietary consumption, and emotional well-being among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A rapid-response online survey was sent to participants in a ten-year longitudinal study (Eating and Activity over Time: EAT 2010â€“2018). A total of 585 young adults (mean age = 24.7 Â± 2.0 years, 63.3% female) living with at least one family member completed the COVID-EAT (C-EAT) survey during the U.S. outbreak of COVID-19. Items assessed changes in family/shared meal frequency, eating behaviors, and emotional well-being. Regression models adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics examined associations between family/shared meal frequency and home food availability, dietary consumption, and emotional well-being. Results Participants reported an average of 4.6 Â± 3.4 family/shared meals per week during COVID-19, a 0.5 meal/week increase from prior to the pandemic (p = .002). Family/shared meal frequency during COVID-19 differed by race/ethnicity, with Asian American participants being most likely to report only 1â€“2 family/shared meals per week. Family/shared meals during COVID-19 were associated with higher vegetable intake, greater availability of fruits, vegetables, and whole wheat bread in the home, lower levels of depressive symptoms and perceived stress, and greater perceived ability to manage stress in young adults. Conclusions Results suggest that engaging in a regular routine, such as family/shared meals, during COVID-19 may have protective associations with dietary health and emotional well-being for young adults. Results may inform practices/routines to offer protective benefits during public health crises such as the current pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101575","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18705,""
"New urban models for more sustainable, liveable and healthier cities post covid19; reducing air pollution, noise and heat island effects and increasing green space and physical activity","Cities are centres of innovation and wealth creation, but also hotspots of air pollution and noise, heat island effects and lack of green space, which are all detrimental to human health. They are also hotspots of COVID19. COVID19 has led to a rethink of urban public space. Therefore, is it time to re-think our urban models and reduce the health burden? We provide a narrative meta-review around a number of cutting edge and visionary urban models that that may affect health and that have been reported over the past few years. New urban concepts such as the Superblocks, the low traffic neighbourhood, 15 Minute city, Car free city or a mixture of these that may go some way in reducing the health burden related to current urban and transport practices. They will reduce air pollution and noise, heat island effects and increase green space and physical activity levels. What is still lacking though is a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness and acceptability of the schemes and the impacts on not only health, but also liveability and sustainability, although they are expected to be positive. Finally, the COVID19 pandemic may accelerate these developments and stimulus funding like the EU Next Generation funding should be used to make these changes.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106850","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18706,""
"Mass quarantine and mental health during COVID-19: A meta-analysis","To reveal the complex relationships between quarantine and mental health during COVID-19, a meta-analysis was conducted involving 34 articles and a total sample size of 134,061. As the relationship between quarantine and mental health was found to be affected by the sampling objects and national factors, a random-effects model was applied for the meta-analysis. First, a heterogeneity test and sensitivity analysis were conducted to determine whether there was heterogeneity in the samples, after which a funnel chart, Rosenthal's Classic Fail-safe N test and Egger's test were applied to further determine whether there was publication bias in the included samples. Finally, a sub-group test was used to explore whether the sampling group and the country of origin had a moderating effect on the relationship between quarantine and mental health, which revealed that the relationship between quarantine and mental health was regulated and influenced by the sampled objects but was not affected by the country categories. The results indicated that: COVID-19 quarantine had varying impacts on individual anxiety, depression, and psychological stress; different groups had different regulatory effects on the relationship between quarantine and mental health; and country of origin had no moderating effect on quarantine and psychology. Background COVID-19 is the most important topic in 2020, and mass quarantine is the measures for pandemic prevention and control around the world since 2020. To explore the relationships between mass quarantine and mental health during COVID-19, a meta-analysis was conducted involving 28 articles and a total sample size of 134,061. Method As the relationship between mass quarantine and mental health was found to be affected by the sampling objects and national factors, a random-effects model was applied for the meta-analysis. First, a heterogeneity test and sensitivity analysis were conducted to determine whether there was heterogeneity in the samples, after which a funnel chart, Rosenthal's Classic Fail-safe N test and Egger's test were applied to further determine whether there was publication bias in the included samples.

Results COVID-19 quarantine had varying impacts on individual anxiety, depression, and psychological stress; different groups had different regulatory effects on the relationship between quarantine and mental health; and country of origin had no moderating effect on quarantine and mental health. Conclusions This study employed a meta-analysis to examine the relationships between the COVID-19 pandemic mass quarantine measures and mental health factors such as anxiety, depression and stress, from which it was found that influence of quarantine on anxiety was stronger, the relationship between quarantine and mental health was affected by the sampled object, and there was no significant relationship between quarantine and country of origin in the sample population.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.067","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-10","",18707,""
