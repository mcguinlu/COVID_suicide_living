"Decreased quality of life and spirometric alterations even after mild-moderate COVID-19","The follow-up of recovered COVID-19 patients is still limited. We aimed to evaluate the changes in quality-of-life (QOL) and spirometric alterations in the convalescent phase of 115 patients with at least 30 days post-COVID-19. We included patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, available past medical records and at least 30 days after the onset of symptoms. All patients were asked to rate their general health condition before and after COVID-19 using the EQ-5D-5L standardized questionary and perform a spirometry at evaluation. In this study, that included 70%(81/115) of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19; there was a severe decrease in QOL up to 56%(64/115). Alterations in usual activities and anxiety/depression were present in 59% of patients with a severe decrease in QOL. The persistence of symptoms was present in 63%(72/115). Restrictive lung impairment was the most common spirometric alteration in 17%(20/115), of whom 65%(13/20) had mild COVID-19. Spirometric alterations are presented even in mild COVID-19, and more remarkably, there is a high rate of alterations in quality of life after the recovery of this disease.","Ordinola Navarro, Cervantes-Bojalil, Cobos Quevedo, Avila MartÃƒÂ­nez, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-JimÃƒÂ©nez, PÃƒÂ©rez ÃƒÂlvarez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez Gil, Peralta Amaro, Vera-Lastra, Lopez Luis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106391","20210417","COVID-19; Post-COVID; Pulmonary Rehabilitation; Quality of life; Respiratory infection; SARS","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12932,""
"Implementation of peer recovery coach services for opioid overdose patients in emergency departments in Indiana: findings from an informal learning collaborative of stakeholders","The Recovery Coach and Peer Support Initiative (RCPSI) in Indiana focused on implementing peer recovery coaches (PRCs) to engage opioid overdose patients in emergency department (ED) settings and promote entry into recovery services. State workers and researchers organized an informal learning collaborative primarily through teleconference meetings with representatives of 11 health service vendors to support implementation. This study presents qualitative analysis of the teleconference meeting discussions that guided RCPSI implementation to display how the informal learning collaborative functioned to support implementation. This informal learning collaborative model can be applied in similar situations where there is limited guidance available for a practice being implemented by multidisciplinary teams. Authors conducted a thematic analysis of data from 32 stakeholder teleconference meetings held between February 2018 and April 2020. The analysis explored the function of these collaborative teleconferences for stakeholders. Major themes representing functions of the meetings for stakeholders include: social networking; executing the implementation plan; identifying and addressing barriers and facilitators; educating on peer recovery services and target population; and working through data collection. During the last 2 months of meetings, stakeholders discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic created multiple barriers but increased use of telehealth for recovery services. Teleconference meetings served as the main component of an informal learning collaborative for the RCPSI through which the vendor representatives could speak with each other and with organizers as they implemented the use of PRCs in EDs.","Staton, Watson, Thorpe","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab031","20210417","COVID-19; Emergency department; Opioid use disorder; Peer recovery coach; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12933,""
"Promoting Safety: Behavioural Emergency Response during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, patients with and without pre-existing mental health diagnoses will either be admitted to the hospital as patients under investigation for COVID-19 or patients positive for COVID-19. A safe and timely response is required for patients exhibiting escalating behaviours (e.g., responsive, agitated and/or aggressive behaviours) to prevent harm to the patient, nearby patients and staff. In this paper, we report on a new protocol that has been implemented throughout our institution to address Code White calls for escalating behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. This procedure uses a least restraint-based philosophy for the management of an escalating situation, involves the use of an interprofessional team of healthcare providers (including mental health clinicians) and security team members and accounts for the need for personal protective equipment. We believe that other hospitals could benefit from knowing about this approach as a strategy to improve patient care and diminish disease transmission.","Lucchese, Bellicoso, Dang, Witz","https://doi.org/10.12927/hcq.2021.26465","20210417","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12934,""
"The next three epochs: Health system challenges amidst and beyond the COVID-19 era","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light tremendous gaps and issues faced by health systems globally. Commendable effort has been made to retain continuity of care for non-COVID-19 patients amidst the pandemic, particularly using technology-enhanced models of care. However, these efforts are not sufficient to tackle the impending challenges that health systems around the world will face next: (1) vaccine uptake and hesitancy; (2) a mental health crisis; and (3) post-COVID-19 migration. In this letter to the editor, explanation of why each of these issues is concerning and how each subsequent issue grows in severity is provided. Particular focus on the issue of post-COVID-19 migration is made, as this challenge is quite pressing to health systems but has yet to be explored thoroughly in the literature. Possible strategies for health system planners to consider are provided in this letter. Strategies include involving stakeholders such as patients and clinicians in deliberations and deployment of interventions, focussing efforts on adapting primary health systems, and building on technology-enhanced models of care where possible. By adhering to the recommendations made in this letter, health systems may be able to proactively deal with the identified challenges before they become crises of their own, post COVID-19.","Arora","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3175","20210417","COVID-19; health policy; health systems; mental health; migrants; primary care; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12935,""
"Positive outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","To investigate whether Australians have experienced any positive effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. National online longitudinal survey. As part of a June 2020 survey, participants (n=1370) were asked 'In your life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic' (yes/no) and also completed the World Health Organisation-Five well-being index. Differences were explored by demographic variables. Free-text responses were thematically coded. 960 participants (70%) reported experiencing at least one positive effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living with others (p=.045) and employment situation (p&lt;.001) at baseline (April), were associated with experiencing positive effects. Individuals working for pay from home were more likely to experience positive effects compared to those who were not working for pay (aOR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.32, 0.63, p&lt;.001), or who were working for pay outside the home (aOR=0.40, 95%CI: 0.28, 0.58, p&lt;.001). 54.2% of participants reported a sufficient level of wellbeing, 23.2% low wellbeing and a further 22.6% very low wellbeing. Of those experiencing positive effects, 945/960 (98%) provided an explanation. The three most common themes were 'Family time' (33%), 'Work flexibility' (29%), and 'Calmer life' (19%). A large proportion of participants reported positive effects resulting from changes to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. The needs of people living alone, and of those having to work outside the home or who are unemployed, should be considered by health policy makers and employers in future pandemic preparedness efforts.","Cornell, Nickel, Cvejic, Bonner, McCaffery, Ayre, Copp, Batcup, Isautier, Dakin, Dodd","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.494","20210417","COVID-19; community; connection; crisis; mental health; positives; resilience; working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12936,""
"Health-related quality of life and quality of care in pregnant and postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cohort study","Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the delivery of high quality care are ongoing concerns when caring for pregnant women in the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared self-reported HRQoL and hospital quality of care (QoC) among perinatal women with and without COVID-19 infection. This is a prospective cohort study of perinatal women attending a tertiary maternity unit during the pandemic. 18 women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 20 SARS-CoV-2-negative women were recruited. Participants completed the Short Form (SF-12), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and Quality from the Patient's Perspective (QPP) questionnaires. Mean scores were compared. 95% of the Non-COVID cohort were Caucasian, while 67% of the COVID-19 cohort were not Caucasian (x<sup>2</sup> =16.01, p&lt;0.0001). The mean SF-12 for physical health in the COVID cohort had significantly lower scores (p&lt;0.0002). There was no difference in mental health and wellbeing between cohorts. The QoC experienced was notably similar and very positive. There was a significantly greater burden on physical health among pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Mental health and psychological status were similar in both groups. High quality of care during a pandemic is possible to deliver in a maternity setting, irrespective of COVID status.","Alaya, Worrall, O'toole, Doyle, Duffy, Geary","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13711","20210417","COVID-19; mental health; pregnancy; quality of health care; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12937,""
"Boston College daily sleep and well-being survey data during early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","While there was a necessary initial focus on physical health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly clear that many have experienced significant social and mental health repercussions as well. It is important to understand the effects of the pandemic on well-being, both as the world continues to recover from the lasting impact of COVID-19 and in the eventual case of future pandemics. On March 20, 2020, we launched an online daily survey study tracking participants' sleep and mental well-being. Repeated reports of sleep and mental health metrics were collected from participants ages 18-90 during the initial wave of the pandemic (March 20 - June 23, 2020). Given both the comprehensive nature and early start of this assessment, open access to this dataset will allow researchers to answer a range of questions regarding the psychiatric impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fallout left in its wake.","Cunningham, Fields, Kensinger","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00886-y","20210417","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12938,""
"Myalgia as a symptom at hospital admission by SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated to persistent musculoskeletal pain as long-term post-COVID sequelae: a case-control study","This study investigated the association between COVID-related myalgia experienced by patients at hospital admission and the presence of post-COVID symptoms. A case-control study including patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 between February 20 and May 31, 2020 was conducted. Patients reporting myalgia and patients without myalgia at hospital admission were scheduled for a telephone interview 7 months after hospital discharge. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. A list of post-COVID symptoms with attention to musculoskeletal pain was evaluated. Anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were likewise assessed. From a total 1,200 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 369 with and 369 without myalgia at hospital admission were assessed 7.2 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. A greater proportion (P=0.03) of patients with myalgia at hospital admission (20%) showed Ã¢â€°Â¥3 post-COVID symptoms when compared with individuals without myalgia (13%). A higher proportion of patients presenting myalgia (OR1.41, 95%CI 1.04-1.90) exhibited musculoskeletal post-COVID pain when compared to those without myalgia. The prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain in the total sample was 38%. Fifty percent of individuals with pre-existing musculoskeletal pain experienced a worsening of their symptoms after COVID-19. No differences in fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety/depressive levels or sleep quality were observed between myalgia and non-myalgia groups. The presence of myalgia at hospital admission was associated with pre-existing history of musculoskeletal pain (OR1.62, 95%CI 1.10-2.40). In conclusion, myalgia at the acute phase was associated with musculoskeletal pain as long-term post-COVID sequelae.

"The impact of the first COVID-19 surge on the mental well-being of ICU nurses: A nationwide survey study","To determine the impact of the first COVID-19 surge (March through June 2020) on mental well-being and associated risk factors among intensive care unit nurses. In September 2020, a nationwide cross-sectional survey study among Dutch intensive care nurses was carried out to measure prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and need for recovery (NFR), objectified by the HADS-A, HADS-D, IES-6 and NFR questionnaires, respectively. Associated risk factors were determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder were reported by 27.0%, 18.6% and 22.2% of the 726 respondents, respectively. The NFR was positive, meaning not being recovered from work, in 41.7%. Working in an academic hospital, being afraid of infecting relatives and experiencing insufficient numbers of colleagues were associated with more mental symptoms, while having been on holiday was associated with reduced depression symptoms and need for recovery. The first COVID-19 surge had a high impact on the mental well-being of intensive care nurses, increasing the risk for drop out and jeopardising the continuity of care. Effort should be made to optimize working conditions and decrease workload to guarantee care in the next months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Heesakkers, Zegers, van Mol, van den Boogaard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2021.103034","20210417","Anxiety; COVID-19; Critical care nursing; Depression; Intensive care unit; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12940,""
"Predictors of sleep quality in medical students during COVID-19 confinement","We aimed to assess sleep quality of Tunisian medical students during home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and sociodemographic, clinical, confinement-related and psychological variables. A correlational cross-sectional study was conducted from April 11th to May 3rd 2020. Medical students who have been in home confinement and who accepted to participate in an online survey were targeted. Sociodemographic data, clinical variables, and data related to home confinement were collected. Participants also completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and Beck Hopelessness Scale. Results showed a high prevalence of poor sleepers among medical students (72.5%) with poor subjective sleep quality, increased sleep latency, sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction. Multiple regression analysis revealed that family history of suicide attempts, tobacco use, perception of home confinement and reduced physical activity during home confinement significantly contributed to poor sleep quality. Among the psychological variables, anxiety and hopelessness significantly contributed to poor sleep quality in medical students during home confinement. Results revealed a high prevalence of poor sleep quality in medical students who have been in home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Except family history of suicide attempts, factors that significantly contributed to poor sleep quality were modifiable factors. Sleep quality and sleep parameters need to be assessed in this particular population and adequate measures aiming to promote quality of sleep need to be enhanced, given the crucial regenerative, homeostatic and psychological roles of sleep.","Saguem, Nakhli, Romdhane, Nasr","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2021.03.001","20210417","Anxiety; AnxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©; Confinement; DÃƒÂ©sespoir.; Home confinement; Hopelessness; Medical students; QualitÃƒÂ© du sommeil; Sleep quality; Ãƒâ€°tudiants en mÃƒÂ©decine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12941,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and eating disorders in children, adolescents, and emerging adults: virtual care recommendations from the Canadian consensus panel during COVID-19 and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental effects on mental health. Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging. While outpatient eating disorder services in Canada have attempted to transition to virtual care, guidelines related to optimal virtual care in this field are lacking. As such, the objective of our Canadian Consensus Panel was to develop clinical practice guidelines related to the provision of virtual care for children, adolescents, and emerging adults living with an eating disorder, as well as their caregivers, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Using scoping review methodology (with literature in databases from 2000 to 2020 and grey literature from 2010 to 2020), the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation tool, and a panel of diverse stakeholders from across Canada, we developed high quality treatment guidelines that are focused on virtual interventions for children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, and their caregivers. Strong recommendations were supported specifically in favour of in-person medical evaluation when necessary for children, adolescents, and emerging adults, and that equity-seeking groups and marginalized youth should be provided equal access to treatment. For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT. For emerging adults, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help was strongly recommended. Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended. Several gaps for future work were identified including the impact of sex, gender, race, and socioeconomic status on virtual care among children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, as well as research on more intensive services, such as virtual day hospitals.","Couturier, Pellegrini, Miller, Bhatnagar, Boachie, Bourret, Brouwers, Coelho, Dimitropoulos, Findlay, Ford, Geller, Grewal, Gusella, Isserlin, Jericho, Johnson, Katzman, Kimber, Lafrance, Leclerc, Loewen, Loewen, McVey, Norris, Pilon, Preskow, Spettigue, Steinegger, Waite, Webb","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00394-9","20210417","Adolescents; Anorexia nervosa; Binge eating disorder; Bulimia nervosa; COVID-19; Children; Eating disorders; Emerging adults; Guidelines; Self-help; Virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12942,""

"Stress, resilience, and coping strategies in a sample of community-dwelling older adults during COVID-19","Assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived stress in older adults is critical to understanding how to best support elderly individuals navigating stressful situations, with the aim to lessen the impact of stressors on their brain health. Here, we collected measures on perceived stress, resilience, and behavioral coping strategies, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a cross-sectional sample of 141 community dwelling older adults (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 74.4Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 8.4, 59% females) who were part of two longitudinal observational studies in Massachusetts, U.S. Our results indicate that participants demonstrated moderate levels of stress related to COVID-19 and showed relatively high levels of resilience. Higher resilience was associated with greater use of adaptive coping behaviors and less use of maladaptive coping behaviors. The use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more stress. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that resilience was the strongest unique predictor of stress, thus, largely accounting for the observed coping-outcome associations. Individual differences in resilience levels moderated the effects of two coping strategies (planning and self-blame) on stress. Specifically, planning was associated with increased levels of stress for people with low resilience. In contrast, high personal resilience attenuated the negative effect of self-blame on their stress levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that resilience is critical for coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future approaches for augmenting resilience could prove to be important potential interventions to help support older adults navigating stressful situations as well as lessen adverse effects on neurocognitive and mental health in the future.","Vannini, Gagliardi, Kuppe, Dossett, Donovan, Gatchel, Quiroz, Premnath, Amariglio, Sperling, Marshall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.050","20210416","COVID-19; Coping; Older adults; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12944,""
"Can Technological Advancements Help to Alleviate COVID-19 Pandemic? A Review","The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing, and the innovative and efficient contributions of the emerging modern technologies to the pandemic responses are too early and cannot be completely quantified at this moment. Digital technologies are not a final solution but are the tools that facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response. In accordance, mobile applications, robots and drones, social media platforms (such as search engines, Twitter, and Facebook), television, and associated technologies deployed in tackling the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak are discussed adequately, emphasizing the current-state-of-art. A collective discussion on reported literature, press releases, and organizational claims are reviewed. This review addresses and highlights how these effective modern technological solutions can aid in healthcare (involving contact tracing, real-time isolation monitoring/screening, disinfection, quarantine enforcement, syndromic surveillance, and mental health), communication (involving remote assistance, information sharing, and communication support), logistics, tourism, and hospitality. The study discusses the benefits of these digital technologies in curtailing the pandemic and 'how' the different sectors adapted to these in a shorter period. Social media and television's role in ensuring global connectivity and serving as a common platform to share authentic information among the general public were summarized. The World Health Organization and Governments' role globally in-line with the prevention of propagation of false news, spreading awareness, and diminishing the severity of the COVID-19 was discussed. Furthermore, this collective review is helpful to investigators, health departments, Government organizations, and policymakers alike to facilitate a quick and effective pandemic response.","Joe Thomas, Lal, Kurian Baby, Rabeeh Vp, James, Raj","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103787","20210416","Disinfection; Healthcare; Real-time monitoring; SARS-CoV-2; Technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12945,""

"Suicide trends in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: an interrupted time-series analysis of preliminary data from 21 countries","The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound mental health consequences for many people. Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world. We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms &quot;suicide&quot; and &quot;cause of death&quot;, before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0Ã‚Â·81 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·72-0Ã‚Â·91]); Alberta, Canada (0Ã‚Â·80 [0Ã‚Â·68-0Ã‚Â·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0Ã‚Â·76 [0Ã‚Â·66-0Ã‚Â·87]); Chile (0Ã‚Â·85 [0Ã‚Â·78-0Ã‚Â·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0Ã‚Â·49 [0Ã‚Â·32-0Ã‚Â·74]); Japan (0Ã‚Â·94 [0Ã‚Â·91-0Ã‚Â·96]); New Zealand (0Ã‚Â·79 [0Ã‚Â·68-0Ã‚Â·91]); South Korea (0Ã‚Â·94 [0Ã‚Â·92-0Ã‚Â·97]); California, USA (0Ã‚Â·90 [0Ã‚Â·85-0Ã‚Â·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0Ã‚Â·79 [0Ã‚Â·67-0Ã‚Â·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0Ã‚Â·82 [0Ã‚Â·68-0Ã‚Â·98]); and Ecuador (0Ã‚Â·74 [0Ã‚Â·67-0Ã‚Â·82]). This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold.

"The Adverse Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Nursing Home Resident Well-Being","Quantify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing home resident well-being. Quantitative analysis of resident-level assessment data. Long-stay residents living in Connecticut nursing homes. We used Minimum Data Set assessments to measure nursing home resident outcomes observed in each week between March and July 2020 for long-stay residents (eg, those in the nursing home for at least 100Ã‚Â days) who lived in a nursing home at the beginning of the pandemic. We compared outcomes to those observed at the beginning of the pandemic, controlling for both resident characteristics and patterns for outcomes observed in 2017-2019. We found that nursing home resident outcomes worsened on a broad array of measures. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased by 6 percentage points relative to before the pandemic in the beginning of March-representing a 15% increase. The share of residents with unplanned substantial weight loss also increased by 6 percentage points relative to the beginning of March-representing a 150% increase. We also found significant increases in episodes of incontinence (4 percentage points) and significant reductions in cognitive functioning. Our findings suggest that loneliness and isolation play an important role. Though unplanned substantial weight loss was greatest for those who contracted COVID-19 (about 10% of residents observed in each week), residents who did not contract COVID-19 also physically deteriorated (about 7.5% of residents in each week). These analyses show that the pandemic had substantial impacts on nursing home residents beyond what can be quantified by cases and deaths, adversely affecting the physical and emotional well-being of residents. Future policy changes to limit the spread of COVID-19 or other infectious disease outbreaks should consider any additional costs beyond the direct effects of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.","Levere, Rowan, Wysocki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.03.010","20210416","COVID-19; nursing home residents; pandemic; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12948,""
"COVID-19 and mental health of food retail, food service, and hospitality workers","The coronavirus pandemic has taken a detrimental toll on the lives of individuals globally. In addition to the direct effect (e.g., being infected with the virus), this pandemic has negatively ravaged many industries, particularly food retail, food services, and hospitality. Given the novelty of the disease, the true impact of COVID-19 remains to be determined. Because of the nature of their work, and the characteristics of the workers, individuals in the food retail, food service, and hospitality industries are a group whose vulnerability is at its most fragile state during this pandemic. Through this qualitative study, we explored workers' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and coping, including screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Twenty-seven individual interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Four key themes emerged: being infected and infecting others, the unknown, isolation, and work and customer demands. Considering the many uncertainties of COVID-19, workers in these three industries were experiencing heightened levels of mental distress because of where they worked and the already existing disparities they faced on a daily basis before the pandemic started. Yet they remained hopeful for a better future. More studies are needed to fully understand the magnitude, short-term, and long-term effects of COVID-19. Based on this study's findings, programs are critically needed to promote positive coping behaviors among at-risk and distressed workers. Recommendations for employers, occupational health and safety professionals, and policy stakeholders to further support these service workers are discussed.","Rosemberg, Adams, Polick, Li, Dang, Tsai","https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1901905","20210416","Coping; coronavirus; essential workers; frontline workers; low-wage workers; service workers; vulnerable workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12949,""

"Fear of relapse, social support, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress level) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during the COVID-19 pandemic stage","Psychological well-being assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The goal of this study is to evaluate fear of relapse, social support, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress level) of Iranian patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic stage. One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. We asked all cases to fill valid and reliable Persian version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), perceived social support, and fear of relapse scale questionnaires. One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. Female to male ratio was (F/M) = 4.6. Mean age and mean duration of disease were 35.3Ã‚Â±8.6 and 7.1Ã‚Â±5 years, respectively. Mean scores of social support, DASS, and FoR questionnaires were 63.1Ã‚Â±16.8, 16.4Ã‚Â±13.4, and 51.4Ã‚Â±17.3, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between social support and FoR scores and also significant positive correlations between components of DASS and FoR. Linear regression analysis by considering FoR as dependent variable and age, sex, marital status, duration of the disease, and EDSS as dependent variables showed that sex was an independent predictor of FoR score.

"The Relationship Between Anxiety Levels, Sleep, and Physical Activity During COVID-19 Lockdown: An Exploratory Study","Nowadays and worldwide, the attention is focused on coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and its consequences on mental health are yet to be fully understood. It is important to capture differences in anxiety levels among populations, groups, and the gender-related variation. Therefore, the present study had two main purposes: (1) to characterize the levels of state anxiety and trait anxiety by examining gender-related, sleep-related, and physical activity-related variations in a nonrepresentative sample of the Portuguese population during the first weeks of lockdown; and (2) to explore the possible relationship between trait anxiety and state anxiety and the possible role of gender as a moderator. This cross-sectional study comprised 1,332 Portuguese adults (aged 18-55 years old) recruited online during COVID-19 outbreak measures. Participants answered to sociodemographic data and the Portuguese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Gender differences were found in both state anxiety (<i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.385) and trait anxiety (<i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.467) with females presenting higher values. People reporting doing more physical activity than usual during COVID-19 lockdown presented lower levels of state anxiety (<i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.200). People reporting more satisfaction with the quality of sleep presented lower levels of both state anxiety (<i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.701) and trait anxiety (<i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001; <i>d</i> = 0.899). Variation associated with the physical activity level (low, moderate, and high) was significantly different among groups in both state anxiety (<i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001) and trait anxiety (<i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001). When analyzing in more detail separating the levels of physical activity, participants performing moderate and high physical activity showed lower values of state and trait anxiety compared to participants with low physical activity. Participants performing high physical activity also showed lower values of state anxiety compared to participants performing moderate physical activity. Higher levels of trait anxiety were related to higher levels of state anxiety, but this association was not moderated by gender. Interventions aiming to support people psychologically during this outbreak should consider anxiety as well as gender and possible behavioral changes in sleep and physical activity, for example. Health professionals should not only consider the anxiety related to the situation we are living but also address trait anxiety to help overcome COVID-19 psychological consequences.","Frontini, Rebelo-GonÃƒÂ§alves, Amaro, Salvador, Matos, MorouÃƒÂ§o, Antunes","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.659599","20210417","anxiety-state and trait; coronavirus; coronavirus disease-19; coronavirus disease-19 outbreak; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12953,""
"Optimal Sense-Making and Resilience in Times of Pandemic: Integrating Rationality and Meaning in Psychotherapy","The global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a wide variety of psychological crises worldwide. In order to respond rapidly and efficiently to the complex challenges, mental health professionals are required to adopt a multidimensional and integrative view. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) founded by Albert Ellis promotes rationality and self-acceptance. Logotherapy, pioneered by Viktor Frankl potentiates meaning and resilience. Both approaches are complementary and mutually enriching. The goal of this paper is to propose an integrative model of &quot;optimal sense-making,&quot; a concept that combines both rationality and meaning, as well as the role of self-transcendence and healthy negative emotions. The model offers a theoretical and clinical foundation for efficient and effective psychological intervention plans for those affected by the pandemic. Along with theoretical background, illustrating case studies are presented to support potential application of the integrative model to affected individuals as well as the work of first-line health professionals during these times of pandemic. Implications are considered for utilizing theoretical and applied insights from the model to cultivate resilience in face of adversity and suffering.","Russo-Netzer, Ameli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645926","20210417","COVID-19 pandemic; logotherapy; meaning; rational emotive behavior therapy; rationality; resilience; self-transcendence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12954,""
"Effect of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on the Psychology and Behavior of Patients on Methadone Maintenance Treatment in Wuhan, China: A Clinical Observational Study","Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a national strategy adopted for the treatment of heroin dependency in China. The sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the resultant social isolation in Wuhan have also had a significant negative impact on local patients undertaking MMT. In this study, 76 patients on MMT from the Wuhan First Health Clinic were selected as the research objects to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as the withdrawal symptoms and craving and substance use. Our results revealed that, during the outbreak, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, HAMA score, HAMD score, and craving in the included patients was significantly higher than that at the baseline and post-epidemic (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, respectively); the positive rate of morphine and methamphetamine urine test was significantly lower than that the post-epidemic (<i>p</i> = 0.01, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, respectively); the amount of tobacco used during the outbreak and the post-epidemic period was significantly higher than that at the baseline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, respectively), while the amount of alcohol consumed at the outbreak was significantly higher than at the baseline and the post-epidemic (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, respectively). The negative emotions aroused by the COVID-19 outbreak and the accompanying social isolation to patients on MMT are an important factor of negative reinforcement that adversely affected the patients' craving for drugs and the consumption of legal substances. This finding suggests the need to strengthen the psychological counseling for patients on MMT during severe epidemic, actively alleviating the negative emotions, reducing the risk of substance abuse, and strengthening drug management after the epidemic to prevent the rise of substance (legal or illegal) abuse.","Liu, Jin, Zhang, Zhang, Li, Ma","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.653662","20210417","COVID-19; MMT; Wuhan; behavior; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12955,""

"Burnout of health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Focus on Medical Oncologists","The spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has challenged hard the national health system worldwide. At any level, the role of health care providers has been rapidly revisited and eventually modified to face the pandemic. The search of the balance between the provision of the most appropriate health-related services and safety of both patients and health care providers has become an indisputable necessity. The consequently increased work load, along with a widespread feeling of intellectual isolation, emotional overload, sense of inadequacy for involvement in tasks and disciplines which are not always familiar have all been proposed as factors related to the onset and/or worsening of the burnout phenomenon. This latter is sadly renown among care givers and is particularly common among medical oncologists. We herein share our perspectives on the burnout phenomenon over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on medical oncologists. Results from the most recent and inherent studies are presented and commented in light of hints provided by the experience matured by a quite restricted, still potentially representative, number of professionals figures from the medical oncologists' category. Reasons are proposed to explain the sense of inadequacy currently perceived in relation to the limits imposed by the current pandemic. In more detail, we illustrate the nature and extents of some of the most relevant difficulties in the optimal management of cancer patients and constant efforts towards the scientific upgrade which allows for the improvement of the professional performance. The need for a deeper understanding of the roots and consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of medical oncologists is finally stressed.","Vici, Krasniqi, Pizzuti, Ciliberto, Mazzotta, Marinelli, Barba","https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.54025","20210417","Covid-19; Medical oncologists; burnout; cancer.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12957,""
"Relationship Between Public Mental Health and Immune Status During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Data from Saudi Arabia","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a worldwide pandemic and continues to escalate exponentially in many countries across the globe. Recently, higher rates of psychological distress have been reported in several countries during the pandemic. Accordingly, the study aim was to investigate the relationship between public mental health and immune status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants of this cross-sectional study were 2252 national and foreign residents of Saudi Arabia. We used a web-based self-rated questionnaire to measure the association between psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales [DASS-21]) and immune status (Immune Status Questionnaire [ISQ]) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also investigated predictors of reduced immune status using binary logistic regression analyses. Data from 1721 respondents showed that 17.5% of participants scored below the immune status cutoff (ISQ Ã‹â€š 6). Mean (Ã‚Â± standard deviation) depression, anxiety, and stress scores in the reduced immune status group (ISQ Ã‹â€š 6) indicated moderate depression, anxiety, and stress (19.1 Ã‚Â± 11.4; 15.0 Ã‚Â± 9.6; 21.8 Ã‚Â± 11.2, respectively) and were significantly higher than scores in the normal immune status group (ISQ Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6) (8.6 Ã‚Â± 9.1, <i>P</i> Ã‹â€š 0.0001; 5.0 Ã‚Â± 6.7, <i>P</i> Ã‹â€š 0.0001; 9.3 Ã‚Â± 9.3, <i>P</i> Ã‹â€š 0.0001, respectively).

"Prevalence of poor psychiatric status and sleep quality among frontline healthcare workers during and after the COVID-19 outbreak: a longitudinal study","Poor psychiatric status and sleep quality were common among frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but the change in these mental health outcomes overtime remained unknown. This study compared the psychiatric status and sleep quality of FHWs during and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. FHWs who volunteered to work in Hubei province (the COVID-19 epicenter) were assessed at baseline during the COVID-19 outbreak and re-assessed when they returned to their place of origin (Liaoning province) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants' psychiatric status and sleep quality were measured with the Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. A total of 494 FHWs was assessed at baseline and 462 at follow-up assessments. The prevalence of poor psychiatric status was 10.5% at baseline and increased to 14.9% at the follow-up assessment (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04).

"Depression and cardiovascular disease","The purpose of this review is to outline the relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression, both as a cause of and a result of CVD. The prevalence of depression seems to be increasing in the general population.It is likely that depression will be even more of a problem for CVD patients in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.New studies confirm the independent association of depression with later incident CVD, although perhaps not as strong as suggested by some previous studies.Depression seems to be becoming even more prevalent in CVD patients, with new data for stroke and peripheral arterial disease patients.Cardiologists rarely screen for depression and most do not believe that they have a responsibility for detecting or treating depression.There are new data suggesting that patients who are more in control of their lives have better outcomes and that change is possible. Depression is preventable and treatable. It is imperative to detect and manage depression in CVD patients. Additional research is required to see whether or not comprehensive patient screening for depression translates into both better quality of life and improved clinical outcomes.","Hare","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOL.0000000000000749","20210416","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12960,""
"Maintaining treatment and prevention programs for opioid use disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","The current article reviews the impact of the biggest health crisis for many decades, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on opioid treatment programs and the strategies adopted for maintaining opioid treatment programs during the pandemic. The difficulty of access to opioid treatment services and the mental health problems accompanying opioid use disorders are the two main challenges to maintaining accessible and effective opioid treatment. Many countries and institutions issued guidance and recommendations to address these challenges. General coping strategies, loosening of policies, telemedicine, and depot buprenorphine are four main strategies to cope with the challenges posed by the pandemic. There were considerable obstacles to maintaining opioid intervention programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies addressing the obstacles are identified. Research in this area needs to be strengthened.","Li, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000708","20210416","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12961,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms of young people in the global south: evidence from a four-country cohort study","To provide evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young people who grew up in poverty in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). A phone survey administered between August and October 2020 to participants of a population-based longitudinal cohort study established in 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-1995 and 2001-2002 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We use logistic regressions to examine associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, structural factors (gender, age), and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems, subjective well-being) measured at younger ages. A geographically diverse, poverty-focused sample, also reaching those without mobile phones or internet access. 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°496 individuals were approached; 9730 participated. Overall, 8988 individuals were included in this study; 4610 (51%) men and 4378 (49%) women. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data. Symptoms consistent with at least mild anxiety or depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (Ã¢â€°Â¥5) or Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (Ã¢â€°Â¥5). Rates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) (95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 38.63% to 43.12%; (29.49-33.74)), and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) (95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 8.16% to 10.58%; (8.33-10.77)), mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Women were most affected in all countries except Ethiopia. Pandemic-related stressors such as health risks/expenses, economic adversity, food insecurity, and educational or employment disruption were risk factors for anxiety and depression, though showed varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent/peer relationships were protective factors, while long-term health or emotional problems were risk factors. Pandemic-related health, economic and social stress present significant risks to the mental health of young people in LMICs where mental health support is limited, but urgently needed to prevent long-term consequences.","Porter, Favara, Hittmeyer, Scott, SÃƒÂ¡nchez JimÃƒÂ©nez, Ellanki, Woldehanna, Duc, Craske, Stein","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049653","20210416","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12962,""
"Use of Kids Helpline by Children and Young People in Australia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The benefits of helplines are particularly valuable during a pandemic when face-to-face services and natural supports are difficult to access. Kids Helpline, Australia's national youth helpline, provides children and young people with free 24/7 information and counseling through telephone, WebChat, and e-mail. We aimed to examine the use of Kids Helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed monthly and weekly time trends of demand for and response by the Kids Helpline. The frequency of counseling contacts by common concern types, age, and gender were also examined. We used Joinpoint regression. Analyses of weekly demand for Kids Helpline showed an increase when the pandemic was declared, followed by a gradual decline. A second rise from 12 July 2020 when parts of Australia experienced a second wave of infections, followed by another decline, occurred more recently. Increased demand was almost entirely in the WebChat modality. Most answered counseling contacts were from girls and those aged 13-18Ã‚Â years. The number of contacts about mental health, suicide/self-harm, and family relationships increased, with mental health contacts also increasing as a proportion of total contacts. COVID-19-related concerns were the most common reason for contact in AprilÃ‚Â 2020. In Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic saw a rapid increase in demand for Kids Helpline, mainly by WebChat, with the virus itself, mental health, suicide/self-harm, and relationships common reasons for contact. Responding to rapid changes in demand for particular modalities is challenging and understanding of the use and effectiveness of different modalities is needed.","Batchelor, Stoyanov, Pirkis, KÃƒÂµlves","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.03.015","20210416","COVID-19; Children; Helpline; Mental health; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12963,""
"Design and implementation of the Professional Wellbeing Programme of the Medical Council Association of Uruguay","Multiple studies have reported a high prevalence of mental health problems among male and female physicians. Although doctors are reluctant to seek professional help when suffering from a mental disorder, specialised services developed specifically to treat their mental health problems have reported promising results. The purpose of this article is to describe the design and implementation of the Professional Wellbeing Programme (Programa de Bienestar Profesional) of the Uruguayan Medical Association (Colegio MÃƒÂ©dico del Uruguay). The context, inputs, activities and some of the outputs are described according to a case study design. The main milestones in the implementation of the programme are also outlined, as well as the enabling elements, obstacles and main achievements. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of international collaboration to share experiences and models, how to design the care process to promote doctors' access to psychiatric and psychological care, the need for them to be flexible and dynamic in adapting to new and changing circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and to work in parallel with the medical regulatory bodies. It is hoped that the experience described in this work may be of use to other Latin American institutions interested in developing mental health programmes for doctors.","Dapueto, Klasse, Campos, RodrÃƒÂ­guez Andrada, Romero AgÃƒÂ¼it, Braquehais, Tolchinsky, Pereira, Sarubbo, Ceroni, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Blanc","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.02.005","20210417","Cuidado de salud del mÃƒÂ©dico; Desarrollo de programa; Healthcare of doctors; MÃƒÂ©dico enfermo; Programme development; Sick doctor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12964,""

"Central Nervous System Manifestations of COVID-19: A Critical Review and Proposed Research Agenda","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new viral entity, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), to be a worldwide pandemic. The characteristics of this virus, as well as its short- and long-term implications, are not yet well understood. The objective of the current paper was to provide a critical review of the emerging literature on COVID-19 and its implications for neurological, neuropsychiatric, and cognitive functioning. A critical review of recently published empirical research, case studies, and reviews pertaining to central nervous system (CNS) complications of COVID-19 was conducted by searching PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, and bioRxiv. After considering the available literature, areas thought to be most pertinent to clinical and research neuropsychologists, including CNS manifestations, neurologic symptoms/syndromes, neuroimaging, and potential long-term implications of COVID-19 infection, were reviewed. Once thought to be merely a respiratory virus, the scientific and medical communities have realized COVID-19 to have broader effects on renal, vascular, and neurological body systems. The question of cognitive deficits is not yet well studied, but neuropsychologists will undoubtedly play an important role in the years to come.","Hewitt, Marra, Block, Cysique, Drane, Haddad, Ã…Âojek, McDonald, Reyes, Eversole, Bowers","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617721000345","20210416","Brain; Cognition; Cognitive function; Coronavirus; Mental health; Neuropsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12966,""
"Comorbidity and COVID-19: Investigating the Relationship between Medical and Psychological Well-being","The unprecedented occurrence of a global pandemic is accompanied by both physical and psychological burdens that may impair quality of life. Research relating to COVID-19 aims to determine the effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations who are at high risk of developing negative health or psychosocial outcomes. Having an ongoing medical condition during a pandemic may lead to greater psychological distress. Increased psychological distress may be due to preventative public health measures (e.g. lockdown), having an ongoing medical condition, or a combination of these factors. This study analyses data from an online cross-sectional national survey of adults in Ireland and investigates the relationship between comorbidity and psychological distress. Those with a medical condition (n128) were compared to a control group without a medical condition (n128) and matched according to age, gender, annual income, education, and work status during COVID-19. Participants and data were obtained during the first public lockdown in Ireland (27.03.202008.06.2020). Individuals with existing medical conditions reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (p&lt;.01) and felt less gratitude (p.001). Exploratory analysis indicates that anxiety levels were significantly associated with illness perceptions specific to COVID-19. Post-hoc analysis reveal no significant difference between the number of comorbidities and condition type (e.g. respiratory disorders). This research supports individualised supports for people with ongoing medical conditions through the COVID-19 pandemic, and has implications for the consideration of follow-up care specifically for mental health. Findings may also inform future public health policies and post-vaccine support strategies for vulnerable populations.","Stafford, Berry, Taylor, Wearen, Prendergast, Murphy, Shevlin, McHugh, Carr, Burke","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.37","20210416","COVID-19; Comorbidity; Ireland; Mental Health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12967,""
"Anxiety, Anhedonia and food consumption during the COVID-19 quarantine in Chile","The current epidemic of COVID-19 has gained attention and highlighted the need for a better understanding of the population's mental health. Diet has been identified as an environmental determinant of mental health. In this regard, it has been suggested that the consumption of palatable foods represents a strategy to mitigate negative emotions, such as anxiety. This study aimed to evaluate the association between symptoms of anxiety and/or anhedonia to food consumption patterns during the period of COVID-19 quarantine in Chile. We conducted a cross-sectional study with non-randomized sampling via an online survey. A total of 1725 responses were collected. Each person self-answered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale for anhedonia, the Food Intake Questionnaire, and questions regarding type and duration of lockdown, as well as body weight and food serving variation. Significant correlations were observed between fried food consumption and self-reported body weight. The subjects who consumed fried food three times a week, had higher weight (63.5%) (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=48.5 and p&lt; 0.001). Those who ate one and two or more pastries on a week had 1.41 and 1.49, respectively higher odds of reporting increased body weight. We found a relationship anxiety level and sugar-sweetened beverages level (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=25.5; p 0.013), fast food intake (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=63.4; p &lt;0.001), and pastry consumption (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=37.7; p &lt;0.001).

"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Venezuelans during the 2020 epidemic: An online cross-sectional survey","COVID-19 threatens health systems worldwide, but Venezuela's system is particularly vulnerable. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, individuals must adopt preventive behaviors. However, to encourage behavior change, we must first understand current knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) that inform response to this health threat. We explored KAPs among Venezuelans using a cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire. The questionnaire explored individuals' knowledge about COVID-19; their attitudes toward the world's and the Venezuelan authorities' abilities to control it; and their self-reported practices. We also collected demographic data. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to predict the adoption of preventive behaviors based on demographic variables, individual knowledge level, and individual attitudes. 3122 individuals completed the questionnaire. Participants had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19. They expressed high levels of optimism that the world would eventually control COVID-19, but they were very pessimistic about the public authorities in Venezuela. Most participants adopted preventive practices. Binomial regression suggests younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers hold lower levels of knowledge, and these groups, as well as men, were less likely to adopt preventive practices. Knowledge, by itself, had no association with optimism and little association with self-reported practices. As other KAP studies in Latin America found, knowledge is not sufficient to prompt behavior change. Venezuelans' pessimism about their own country's ability should be explored in greater depth. Health promotion in Venezuela may wish to target the most at risk groups: men, younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers.","Bates, Tami, Carvajal, Grijalva","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249022","20210415","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12969,""

"Risk-Taking Behavior in Recovered COVID-19 Patients","The aim of this study is to investigate risk-taking behavior and decision-making processes in recovered COVID-19 patients. Twenty patients recovered from COVID-19 as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and twenty-one healthy individuals were recruited. A computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Test (IGT) for measuring risk-taking behavior tendencies as a decision-making process and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and WMS-R Digit Span Forward Test (DSFT) for clinical assessments included. The assessments of the recovered patients were applied on the initial phase that the tests of the patients were negative and on the 4-week follow up phase. The results showed that the anxiety scores were significantly higher in the healthy control group than in the group of recovered patients. The IGT-Net 4 scores were significantly and IGT-Net total scores were marginally significantly lower in the group of recovered patients. In other words, recovered patients showed higher risk-taking behavior tendencies. This tendency difference is consistent with the anxiety levels of the groups. These IGT scores showed to be persistent in the 4-week follow up phase. Our findings indicate that recovered patients show higher risk-taking behavior tendencies than healthy controls and this may be the result of overcoming the COVID-19 threat.","Egeli, AdÃ„Â±gÃƒÂ¼zel, KapÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±, GÃƒÂ¼c, Yetkin Tekin, Tekin","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.107","20210415","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12973,""

The participants were 155 respondents recruited online in the period 27.04.2020 until 05.06.2020, who completed the Albanian version of PHQ-9. Mean score of depression resulted 10.94 (SD=9.22). 63% of participants agreed that the situation has worsened their psychological state; 35.6% had a mild to severe form of depression and 18.7% had minimal symptoms. 13.4% of participants saw iCBT as helpful, 16.8% a little while 65.8% wanted to try it. Significantly higher depression resulted for females and age-group 18 to 24 years. No significant differences by levels of education, marital status, employment, socio-economic status and by expectations regarding iCBT. Gender and perception of worsened psychological state showed predictive abilities for depression. The situation with Covid-19 has increased depression levels especially among females and 18 to 24 years old and thus expectations for e-psychotherapy.

"Intervention Effect of the Integration Model on Negative Emotions of Adolescents during the Outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019","The World Health Organization has declared the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Given the sudden infection from and extensive dispersion of COVID-19 and the absence of specific drugs, those infected are in danger if they are not treated in time. Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group. Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P&lt;0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P&lt;0.01). The intervention using the integrated model can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, increase positive emotions, and improve the overall well-being of adolescents during the epidemic period.","Chen, Sang, Zhang, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.86","20210415","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12975,""
"Increased referrals to an Australian Consultation Liaison Psychiatry service during the COVID-19 pandemic","It has been widely predicted that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a detrimental impact on the mental health (MH) of individuals. This has been dubbed as the MH 'second wave'. In Australia, these impacts have been partly mitigated by institutional responses such as increased access to psychotherapy. Consultation Liaison (CL) psychiatry services provide MH care to acutely unwell patients in general hospitals. It was hypothesised that the number of referrals to the studied service had increased since the start of the pandemic. From the Electronic medical records (eMRs), the authors collected daily referral numbers, over 3 consecutive years, to a large CL service in metropolitan Sydney. Referrals were significantly increased by 25%, 95% CI [1.14, 1.36], <i>p</i> &lt; .001 since the start of the pandemic. This increase was delayed, and remained elevated despite a reduction in COVID-19 infections.

"Ten Urgent Priorities Based on Lessons Learned From More Than a Half Million Known COVID-19 Cases in US Prisons","COVID-19 is ravaging US prisons. Prison residents and staff must be prioritized for vaccination, but a rapidly mutating virus and high rates of continued spread require an urgent, coordinated public health response.Based on knowledge accumulated from the pandemic thus far, we have identified 10 pressing public health priorities for responding to COVID-19 in prisons: (1) accelerate population reduction coupled with community reentry support, (2) improve prison ventilation systems, (3) ensure appropriate mask use, (4) limit transfers between facilities, (5) strengthen partnerships between public health departments and prison leadership, (6) introduce or maintain effective occupational health programs, (7) ensure access to advance care planning processes for incarcerated patients and delineation of patient health care rights, (8) strengthen partnerships between prison leadership and incarcerated people, (9) provide emergency mental health support for prison residents and staff, and (10) commit to public accountability and transparency.Dedicated prison leaders cannot accomplish these public health priorities alone. We must mobilize prison leaders, staff, and residents; public health departments; community advocates; and policymakers to work together to address the pandemic's outsized impact in US prisons.

"COVID-19 and the Drug Overdose Crisis: Uncovering the Deadliest Months in the United States, JanuaryÃ¢â‚¬â€™July 2020","<b>Objectives.</b> To determine the magnitude of increases in monthly drug-related overdose mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.<b>Methods.</b> We leveraged provisional records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided as rolling 12-month sums, which are helpful for smoothing, yet may mask pandemic-related spikes in overdose mortality. We cross-referenced these rolling aggregates with previous monthly data to estimate monthly drug-related overdose mortality for January through July 2020. We quantified historical errors stemming from reporting delays and estimated empirically derived 95% prediction intervals (PIs).<b>Results.</b> We found that 9192 (95% PIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8988, 9397) people died from drug overdose in May 2020-making it the deadliest month on record-representing a 57.7% (95% PIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°54.2%, 61.2%) increase over May 2019.

"Comparing the initial impact of COVID-19 on burden and psychological distress among family caregivers of children with and without developmental disabilities","The current COVID-19 pandemic is presenting challenges for families (Cluver et al., The Lancet, 2020), which may be exacerbated for caregivers of children with developmental disabilities (DDs; Center on the Developing Child, Stress, hope, and the role of science: Responding to the coronavirus pandemic, 2020). The purpose of this study was to explore caregiver burden and psychological distress among caregivers of children with DD as compared to caregivers of typically developing children across the United States as a result of COVID-19. Between 2 weeks and 1 month following COVID-19-related school closures, a total of 460 caregivers from across the U.S. completed an online survey via Qualtrics; recruitment and initial survey completion occurred simultaneously. Of the total sample of eligible participants (N = 407), 225 were the primary caregiver of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 182 were the primary caregiver of a child without ASD/ADHD. Participants across groups indicated varying levels of exposure to COVID-19 and an impact of COVID-19 at the community and individual or family levels. However, caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD reported significantly higher levels of burden, depression, anxiety, and stress. Overall, findings are consistent with anecdotal and preliminary reports that all caregivers are experiencing COVID-19-related challenges, with caregivers of children with ASD/ADHD experiencing even greater challenges, particularly with regard to burden and psychological distress.

"Coping and Mental Health in Early Adolescence during COVID-19","The current longitudinal study examines changes in overall mental health symptomatology from before to after the COVID-19 outbreak in youth from the southeastern United States as well as the potential mitigating effects of self-efficacy, optimism, and coping. A sample of 105 parent-child dyads participated in the study (49% boys; 81% European American, 1% Alaska Native/American Indian, 9% Asian/Asian American; 4% Black/African American; 4% Latinx; and 4% other; 87% mothers; 25% high school graduate without college education; 30% degree from 4-year college; 45% graduate or professional school). Parents completed surveys when children were aged 6-9, 8-12, 9-13, and 12-16, with the last assessments occurring between May 13, 2020 and July 1, 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. Children also completed online surveys at ages 11-16 assessing self-efficacy, optimism, and coping. Multi-level modeling analyses showed a within-person increase in mental health symptoms from before to after the outbreak after controlling for changes associated with maturation. Symptom increases were mitigated in youth with greater self-efficacy and (to some extent) problem-focused engaged coping, and exacerbated in youth with greater emotion-focused engaged and disengaged coping. Implications of this work include the importance of reinforcing self-efficacy in youth during times of crisis, such as the pandemic, and the potential downsides of emotion-focused coping as an early response to the crisis for youth.","Hussong, Midgette, Thomas, Coffman, Cho","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-021-00821-0","20210417","Adolescents; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12980,""
"Prescribing of Opioid Analgesics and Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical care, impacting prescribing of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Understanding these patterns can help address barriers to care. To evaluate how prescribing of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic among both new and existing patients. In this cross-sectional study, use of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder from March 18 to September 1, 2020, was projected using a national database of retail prescriptions from January 1, 2018, to March 3, 2020. Actual prescribing was compared with projected levels for all, existing, and new patients. The data include prescriptions to patients independent of insurance status or type and cover 90% of retail prescriptions, 70% of mail-order prescriptions, and 70% of nursing home prescriptions. Prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Outcomes included total number of prescriptions, total morphine milligram equivalents, mean morphine milligram equivalents per prescription, mean dispensed units per prescription, and number of patients filling prescriptions. A total of 452Ã¢â‚¬Â¯691Ã¢â‚¬Â¯261 prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder were analyzed for 90Ã¢â‚¬Â¯420Ã¢â‚¬Â¯353 patients (50Ã¢â‚¬Â¯921Ã¢â‚¬Â¯535 female patients [56%]; mean [SD] age, 49 [20] years). From March 18 to May 19, 2020, 1877 million total morphine milligram equivalents of opioid analgesics were prescribed weekly vs 1843 million projected, a ratio of 102% (95% prediction interval [PI], 94%-111%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.71). The weekly number of opioid-naive patients receiving opioids was 370Ã¢â‚¬Â¯051 vs 564Ã¢â‚¬Â¯929 projected, or 66% of projected (95% PI, 63%-68%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Prescribing of buprenorphine was as projected for existing patients, while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 9865 vs 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯008 projected, or 82% (95% PI, 76%-88%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). From May 20 to September 1, 2020, opioid prescribing for new patients returned to 100% of projected (95% PI, 96%-104%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.95), while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯436 vs 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯613 projected, or 90% (95% PI, 83%-97%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009). In this cross-sectional study, existing patients receiving opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder generally maintained access to these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid prescriptions for opioid-naive patients decreased briefly and then rebounded, while initiation of buprenorphine remained at a low rate through August 2020. Reductions in treatment entry may be associated with increased overdose deaths.","Currie, Schnell, Schwandt, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.6147","20210416","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12981,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Hospital Staff","The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a mental health crisis among hospital staff who have been mentally and physically exhausted by uncertainty and unexpected stressors. However, the mental health challenges and complexities faced by hospital staff in the United States has not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we conducted this study to examine the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among hospital staff in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The design is a single-center, cross-sectional, online survey evaluating depression and anxiety among all hospital employees (n = 3,500) at a safety-net hospital with a moderate cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate between April 30-May 22, 2020. We assessed depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to identify associations with depression and anxiety. Of 3,500 hospital employees, 1,246 (36%) responded to the survey. We included 1,232 individuals in the final analysis. Overall, psychological distress was common among the respondents: 21% and 33% of staff reported significant depression and anxiety, respectively, while 46% experienced overwhelming stress due to COVID-19. Notably, staff members overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 were seven and nine times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, respectively. In addition to stress, individuals with six to nine years of work experience were two times more likely to report moderate or severe depression compared to those with 10 or more years of work experience. Moreover, ancillary staff with direct patient contact (odds ratio [OR] 8.9, confidence interval (CI), 1.46, 173.03) as well as administrative and ancillary staff with indirect patient contact (OR 5.9, CI, 1.06, 111.01) were more likely to be depressed than physicians and advanced providers. We found that a considerable proportion of staff were suffering from psychological distress. COVID-19-associated depression and anxiety was widespread among hospital staff even in settings with comparatively lower COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Ancillary staff, administrative staff, staff with less job experience, and staff overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 are particularly susceptible to negative mental health outcomes. These findings will help inform hospital policymakers on best practices to develop interventions to reduce the mental health burden associated with COVID-19 in vulnerable hospital staff.","Hassamal, Dong, Hassamal, Lee, Ogunyemi, Neeki","https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.11.49015","20210417","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12982,""
"Early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions on ambulance missions","The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a major impact on health care services globally. Recent studies report that emergency departments have experienced a significant decline in the number of admitted patients in the early phase of the pandemic. To date, research regarding the influence of COVID-19 on emergency medical services (EMS) is limited. The present study investigates a change in the number and characteristics of EMS missions in the early phase of the pandemic. All EMS missions in the Northern Ostrobothnia region, Finland (population 295 500) between 1 March to 30 June 2020 were screened and analyzed as the study group. A control group was composed from the EMS calls between the corresponding months in the years 2016-2019. A total of 74 576 EMS missions were screened for the study. Within the first two months after the first COVID-19 cases in the study area, the decline in the number of EMS missions was 5.7% - 13% compared to the control group average. EMS time intervals (emergency call to dispatch, dispatch, en-route, on-scene and hospital handover) prolonged in the COVID-19 period. Dispatches concerning mental health problems increased most in the study period (+1.2%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Only eleven confirmed COVID-19 infections were encountered by EMS in the study period. Our findings suggest that the present COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions lead to changes in the EMS usage. These preliminary findings emphasize the importance of developing new strategies and protocols in response to the oncoming pandemic waves.","Laukkanen, Lahtinen, Liisanantti, Kaakinen, Ehrola, Raatiniemi","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab065","20210415","COVID-19; emergency medical services; prehospital care; social restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12983,""
"Observational study on the potential psychological factors that affected Italian nurses involved in the COVID-19 health emergency","The present study aimed to identify the potential psychological malaise factors affecting the Italian nurses on the front lines of Covid-19 patient care since evidence suggested that they are at high risk of developing psychological disorders. An online questionnaire was administered to 291 Italian nurses, containing information on: sex, years of work experience, region of Italy where nurses worked and the intensive care unit assignment. Then, the anxiety disorders, the impact of the event, the depression and the insomnia conditions and their principal psychological factors influencing nurses during the health emergency. were assessed Results. Nurses worked in Northern Italy registered higher anxiety scores than others (p=0.023); the assignment to the intensive care unit (p=0.042) not influenced these scores.

"Suicide and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis, but its effect on suicide deaths is little understood. We analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and October 2020 and from online surveys on mental health filled out by the general population in Japan. Compared to the 2017-19 period, the number of suicide deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic was lower than average but exceeded the past trend from July 2020. Female suicides, whose numbers increased by approximately 70% in October 2020 (incidence rate ratio: 1.695, 95% confidence interval: 1.558-1.843), were the main source of this increase. The largest increase was found among young women (less than 40Ã‚Â years of age). Our survey data indicated that the status of young women's mental health has been deteriorating in recent months and that young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss than any other group, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding them. Continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ueda, NordstrÃƒÂ¶m, Matsubayashi","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab113","20210415","mental health; morbidity and mortality; socioeconomics factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12986,""

"Mental health policy: protecting community mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite the growing interest in the treatment and management of COVID-19, communities still end up experiencing multiple stresses with mental health crisis, due to the pandemic. When this is not addressed, it causes stress in the long run, with further mental health damage in individuals and the communities. Furthermore, relevant policy related to the community mental health was identified as awareness in promoting mental issues, yet there are still failures recorded in the aspect of adequately addressing the well-being concerns. This study aims to support community mental health during the crisis, through useful information from relevant articles. It also explains some perspectives from literature reviews, case reports, with society responses from Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Proquest databases concerning recent community mental health issues, and government policy on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion criteria required articles that were peer-reviewed, by using i) English language March-September 2020; ii) Presented empirical studies related to COVID-19 (quantitative and qualitative); iii) Searched terms related to the general and community mental health, their policy, and COVID-19 pandemic. This study showed 19 articles related to community mental health issues or psychological wellbeing topics. The interventions provided to strengthen community mental health during the pandemic included emergency psychological crisis treatment, hotline assistance, online counseling service with mental care course, and outpatient consultation. Therefore, community mental health issues should be addressed with physical wellness. In addition, the community plays a key role in influencing stakeholders and governments, to increase the priority in supporting mental health.","Lestari, Setyawan","https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2231","20210415","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12988,""

"Use of buprenorphine for those with employer-sponsored insurance during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To quantify weekly rates of use of buprenorphine for those with employer-based insurance and whether the rate differs based on county-level measures of race, historical fatal drug overdose rate, and COVID-19 case rate. Methods We used 2020 pharmaceutical claims for 4.8 million adults from a privately insured population to examine changes in the use of buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantified variation by examining changes in use rates across counties based on their fatal drug overdose rate in 2018, number of COVID-19 cases per capita, and percent nonwhite. Results Weekly use of buprenorphine was relatively stable between the first week of January (0.6 per 10,000 enrollees, 95%CIÂ =Â 0.2 to 1.1) and the last week of August (0.8 per 10,000 enrollees, 95%CIÂ =Â 0.4 to 1.3). We did not find evidence of any consistent change in use of buprenorphine by county-level terciles for COVID-19 rate as of August 31, 2020, age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate, and percent nonwhite. Use was consistently higher for counties in the highest tercile of county age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate when compared to counties in the lowest tercile of county age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate.

"Research on substance use disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered changes in the substance use disorder (SUD) treatment delivery system, in the availability of legal and illicit drugs, and in other social and economic factors. As such, these changes necessitate that the field re-evaluate research approaches to SUDs, including in epidemiology, clinical trials, health services, implementation and policy research, as well as basic and translational neuroscience. COVID-19 has reduced researchers' access to target populations and made it difficult for them to obtain timely data to monitor changes in patterns of drug use and overdoses. These changes have increased researchers' interest in virtual technologies to expand and accelerate access to populations; increased modifications in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials; and increased emphasis on implementation. Similarly, as researchers better understand the biology of COVID-19, they will better understand potential effects of COVID-19 on neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, mechanisms underlying COVID-19 associated neurological and psychiatric sequelae, and interactions between COVID-19 treatments and psychoactive substances. The pandemic has also revealed the need for research that addresses health disparities. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged several aspects of current research on SUD. Responding to these challenges provides opportunities to develop robust research approaches that align with the goals of improving patient outcomes and public health and are resilient to the challenges of future crises.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108385","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12992,""
"Lived experiences of older adults living in the community during the COVID-19 lockdown â€“ The case of mauritius","Adoption of strict social distancing and sanitary measures were inevitable in the attempt to thwart the spread of the Covid-19 virus. These measures, however, came at a cost for older adults who faced major mental health issues because of social isolation. The impact of social isolation remains well documented in the wake of the pandemic. This paper explored the lived experiences of older adults living in the community during the Covid-19 sanitary lockdown in the small-island state of Mauritius. As a small-island state with family structures that still skew towards extended or modified extended families, it was interesting to explore whether older adults would be reporting feelings of social isolation as was being reported elsewhere. This study utilized a qualitative approach using a lifeworld hermeneutical approach with 15 older adult participants, recruited through convenience and snowball sampling, in the community. Data were collected using a narrative approach supplemented by an interview guide. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from transcribed and translated data. Six themes were discovered: Fears of the virus and fear of deprivation; Reliving and recreating bonds; Active contribution to family life; Being and feeling valued within the family; Rediscovering family time and family moments; and Fear of going back to â€˜normalâ€™. The study revealed positive experiences of the lockdown period characterised by an increase bonding in the family, deepening of familial bond, and increased value despite an initial apprehension of the lockdown. A renewed sense of purpose as well as deepening of bonds was reported by older adults. Some limitations in relation to data trustworthiness and respondents bias, however, could not be avoided since the study was carried out during sanitary lockdown period. The feelings of social isolation and depression reported by older adults who lived alone were not seen in this study, suggesting that the family structure may have a role to play in mitigating these effects. There would also be a need to explore similar small-island states or similar cultures where the effects of sanitary lockdowns may be different from current literature.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2021.100932","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12993,""

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and burnout severity in French residents: A national study","Background and objectives We measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and burnout of French residents. Methods Residents completed a questionnaire assessing their personal life, work, social relationships, mental health, burden and psychological impact of the pandemic. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) allowed to identify 5 classes of burnout of increasing severity: burnout free, intermediate, 1, 2 or 3 dimensions severely impacted. Variables significantly linked with burnout, defined as having a high impact on at least one of the 3 dimensions of the MBI, were entered into a logistic regression. Results There were 1050 responses. Mean age was 27Â±2 years. Since the start of the pandemic, only one resident in four said they were in their normal state of mind, more than half felt tired and one third anxious and/or stressed and/or depressed. The total burnout rate was 55%. There was a strong link between the severity of the burnout syndrome and the impact of the pandemic. 7 factors were independently linked to burnout: number of monthly calls (p<0.001), psychiatric history (p<0.001), interpersonal conflicts (p=0.002), desire to quit the specialty (p=0.002), fatigue (p=0.004), job satisfaction (p=0.004), and depression (p=0.05). Conclusion Caring for Covid positive patients was not the most important cause of burnout, but there was a strong relationship between burnout severity and psychological impact of the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2021.03.005","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12996,""
"Effects of scientific literacy on attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations and preventive behaviors: A pre-registered study","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, is a global public health crisis. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is necessary to promote vaccine administration and preventive behaviors (e.g., mask, handwashing, social distancing). However, some people have negative attitudes toward vaccine administration and preventive behaviors. The present study investigated how scientific literacy and perceived understanding of COVID-19 influence attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations and preventive behaviors. The findings demonstrated that both scientific literacy and perceived understanding of COVID-19 vaccines were positively associated with attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, perceived understanding of COVID-19 preventive behaviors (but not scientific literacy) was positively associated with attitudes toward/practice of COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Collectively, our findings revealed the role of cognitive factors in preventing the global public health crisis and demonstrated the effects of objective and subjective knowledge on attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations and preventive behaviors.","Kosuke Motoki et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-77D-6D6","20210417","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; preventive behaviors; covid-19; objective knowledge about science; vaccines; scientific literacy; attitudes","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-18","",12997,""
