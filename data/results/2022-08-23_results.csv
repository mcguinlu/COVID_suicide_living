"Anxiety and depression in individuals with and without cancer during the early COVID-19 pandemic period","Introduction/Objective The COVID-19 disease, which has turned into an important public health problem, has negatively affected individuals not only physically but also psychologically. The aim of this study is to examine the anxiety and depression status of cancer patients, comparing to individuals with non-cancer chronic diseases and healthy individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic period between May 8 and June 25 2020 with 1107 people in Turkey. The mean age of the participants in the study was 36.41 +/- 12.80. The sample comprised three groups: cancer group (n = 262), chronic disease control group (n = 250), and healthy control group (n = 595). The data were collected with the Descriptive Characteristics Form and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results The anxiety and depression scores were found to be higher in patients with cancer comparing to the other two groups. Having cancer was predictive of higher anxiety and depression score explaining 13% of the anxiety scores variance and 17% of the depression scores variance. Patients with the non-cancer chronic diseases, and healthy participants had anxiety and depression mean scores in the range of the borderline level. Conclusion These findings suggest that depression and anxiety rates among patients with cancer are specifically higher comparing to patients with other chronic diseases and healthy individuals. The levels of anxiety and depression in the latter two groups should also be paid attention to during the pandemic. This study may have important practical implications in terms of the need for psychological screening.","Ayaz, E.

"Longitudinal study about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in a southern Brazilian state: the PAMPA cohort","This study aimed to describe the effects of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health, chronic disease management, and economic situation in adults from a southern Brazilian state. Data from the baseline of the PAMPA (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health) cohort, a population-based, longitudinal study is presented. An online-based questionnaire was used to assess the variables pre- and during social distancing. Most of the respondents (N=2,321) were women (76.7%), white (90.6%), had at least university degree (66.7%), and were overweight or obese (53.3%). Nearly 40% were not able to work from home and 45.3% had monthly income reduced during social distancing. Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety increased 7.3x and 8.4x from before to during social distancing. Three quarters reported low back pain (74.2%;95%CI: 71.9%, 76.3%) during the same period while the prevalence of physical inactivity increased 31.2%. Managing chronic conditions was harder during social distancing for 28.5% of the participants. Roughly 40% reported that did not seek medical assistance even when necessary during this period.

"Psychosocial Coping Resources and the Toll of COVID-19 Bereavement","The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a bereavement crisis unparalleled in a generation, with devastating consequences for the mental health of those who lost a loved one to the virus. Using national survey data (n = 2,000) containing detailed information about people?s experiences of pandemic-related stressors, coping resources, and mental health, in this study we examine whether and how three psychosocial coping resources?mastery, self-esteem, and social support?moderate the association between COVID-19 bereavement and psychological distress. We find that coping resources have both expected and unanticipated effects on the relationship between bereavement and mental health. Consistent with the stress process model, higher levels of mastery uniformly reduce the damaging effects of bereavement on depressive symptoms and anger, whereas self-esteem mitigates the positive association between losing a close tie to the virus and reports of anger. Contrary to the stress-buffering hypothesis, however, higher levels of perceived support exacerbate the positive associations between bereavement and each indicator of psychological distress. Our findings suggest that the putatively advantageous aspects of social support may be compromised, or even reversed, in the context of constrained social engagement. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for sociological research on the stress process.","Grace, Matthew K.; VanHeuvelen, Jane S.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21568693221113221","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Society and Mental Health;: 21568693221113221, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36369,""

A total of 504 seventh-grade students (52% boys) and their caregivers in Beijing, China completed an online survey in September 2020. Youth reported experiencing various COVID-19-related stressful life events (i.e., conflicts with parents, poor learning environment and efficiency, family financial pressure), and about 15% reported slightly elevated scores of mental health difficulties. Findings suggested personal resilience and quality of peer relationship predicted positive mental health (i.e., covitality or co-occurrence of positive psychological dispositions) and less mental health difficulties. Parentâ€™s critical comparison intensified the negative link between stressful life events and youth mental health.

"A 1-year longitudinal study: Change in mental health outcomes of frontline emergency department healthcare workers in this COVID-19 pandemic","Background: There are ample cross-sectional data demonstrating association of COVID-19 pandemic with depression and anxiety in frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies among frontline HCWs to quantify the change in depression and anxiety in this pandemic. Objectives: We aim to (1) quantify the change in depression and anxiety symptoms in our cohort of frontline emergency department (ED) HCWs over a 1-year period, and (2) identify factors associated with this change. Methods: This is a prospective longitudinal single-center study carried out over a 1-year period in June 2020 and June 2021. A paper-based survey questionnaire was administered to ED HCWs and participation was voluntary. Depression and anxiety were measured using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21). No specific intervention was implemented by the study team over the year. The overall response rate was 93.5%. In all, 241 HCWs were matched based on last 4 digits of their phone number, gender, ethnicity, and occupation. Logistic regressions were performed to identify factors associated with depression and anxiety. Results: HCWs were mainly females (71.8%), nurses (71.4%), or Chinese (38.6%). There was a significant increase in median depression score among doctors (2020: 1 (0-3) vs 2021: 3 (0-5), p=0.018). HCWs =41 years (odds ratio (OR), 10.6;95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-75.9)), living with elderly (OR, 4.3;1.3-14.4), and with greater Concerns in Workload (OR, 2.5;1.5-4.2) had higher risk of depression. HCWs with more years of work experience (OR, 0.9;0.8-1.0) and who perceived better workplace support (OR, 0.3;0.2-0.6) had lower risk of depression. There was significant reduction in median anxiety score among all HCWs (2020: 2 (0-4) vs 2021: 2 (0-4), p=0.045) and in prevalence of anxiety (2020: 30.7% vs 2021: 21.6%, p=0.023). HCWs living with elderly (OR, 5.9;1.8-19.2), with greater Concerns in COVID-19 Infection Risk (OR, 2.0;1.1-3.3), and with Workload (OR, 1.6;1.0-2.6) had higher risk of anxiety, while those living with young children (OR, 0.1;0.02-0.5) had lower risk of anxiety. Conclusion: Our longitudinal study showed that mental health outcomes in frontline ED HCWs continued to be poor after a year. Several factors have been identified, which will allow for targeted interventions to optimize and prevent deterioration of our frontline HCWs' well-being.","Thng, F.; Seow, E.; Ge, L.; Mao, D.; Rao, A.; Neo, H.

"Physical Distancing and Mental Well-Being in Youth Population of Portugal and Brazil during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic may affect youth's physical and mental well-being, partially because of the countries' rules to contain the virus from spreading. However, there is still uncertainty about the impact of physical distancing on youth's mental health. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of feeling agitated, anxious, down, sad, or low mood (FNF) due to physical distance measures and verify which factors are associated with young Portuguese and Brazilian people. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the instrument ""COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion""in Portugal (March 2020 and September 2021) and from ""COVID-19 Social Thermometer""in Brazil (August 2020 to April 2021);these surveys included data regarding the health and socioeconomic impact on the population. The health and sociodemographic variables of the two countries were summarized as absolute and relative frequencies. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit by country to estimate the relation between FNF and selected variables of interest. Results: Approximately 36% of the sample studied reported anxiety, agitation, sadness, or low mood almost every day in Portugal and 52% in Brazil due to physical distancing. In Portugal, having more than two comorbidities represented a greater chance of experiencing FNF every day or almost every day (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51 [CI: 1.22-1.87]) than those without comorbidities. In contrast, having a university education level represented a protector factor (OR = 0.76 [CI: 0.67-0.88]). In Brazil, being unemployed increased the chance of FNF compared to students (OR = 11.2). Conclusions: Physical distancing measures have impacted the mental well-being of the young population in Portugal and Brazil. The countries must make a quick effort to attend to and protect young people's well-being and mental health in the changing context of the current pandemic.","Gil, J. D. C.; Aguiar, P. M.

"Predictors of post-stroke depression in the acute phase of ischemic stroke: a cross-sectional study","Background and aims: Ischemic stroke is a remarkable cause of death and disability worldwide. Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychiatric disturbance after stroke. Despite PSD being a potentially treatable condition, it still requires approaches to improve the early diagnosis. The present study aims to investigate the predictors and correlated variables associated with PSD during hospitalization. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in a specialized center of neurology situated at Santa Catarina, Brazil. 148 patients with acute ischemic stroke hospitalized between January 2020 and February 2021 were included. Sociodemographic, clinical and radiological variables were assessed during hospitalization. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was applied, as well as the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Predictors factors were investigated through binary logistic regression and continuous variables through correlation tests. Results: The prevalence of PSD during hospitalization was 31.1%. Predictors of PSD in the acute phase of the stroke were female sex (OR: 2.6;CI 95%: 1.3 to 5.4;p&lt;0.01) and post-stroke anxiety during hospitalization (OR: 4.9;CI 95%: 2.3 to 10.3;p&lt;0.01). The variables NIHSS, mRS, and stroke area were positively correlated with HADS - depression values. Conclusion: This research evidenced a high prevalence of PSD in the acute phase of stroke. Despite the study being conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the data found is similar to the non-pandemic periods. The research provided clues to identify and early treat patients at greater risk of developing PSD during hospitalization.","Elias, S.; Benevides, M.; Martins, A.; Martins, G.; Marcos, A.; Nunes, J.","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15466","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Neurology; 29:384, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36373,""

"Illness perceptions in long-COVID: A cross-sectional analysis in adults","Symptoms may persist after an acute COVID-19 infection, a phenomenon termed long-COVID. Increasing attention is now directed toward these long-term effects, as many seem to be affected. So far, long-COVID was primarily discussed from a medical perspective, leaving psychological factors on health-related outcomes understudied. Thus, the present study contributes to the current literature by examining Leventhal's common-sense model of self-regulation, investigating patients' cognitive and emotional illness perceptions and their association with different health-related outcomes in the context of long-COVID. We examined 246 long-COVID patients (89.0% female, M (age) = 45.29 +/- 12.12 years), assessing illness perceptions, fatigue, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life in a cross-sectional survey study. Linear regression analyses were applied to model the unique effects of the illness perception dimension on health-related outcomes. More than half of the sample had elevated levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue. Illness perception dimensions explained between 28% and 37% of the variance across the analyzed health-related outcomes. More symptoms, higher perceived consequences, and higher emotional representation were related to worse health-related outcomes. In general, long-COVID was poorly understood (i.e., low coherence) and perceived as difficult to control (i.e., personal & treatment control). Health professionals involved in counseling should pay close attention to both cognitive and emotional illness perceptions to address possible ways of coping with long-COVID.","Bierbauer, W.; Luscher, J.; Scholz, U.","https://doi.org/10.1080/23311908.2022.2105007","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cogent Psychology; 9(1):13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36376,""

"Exploratory analysis of college students' occupational engagement during COVID-19","Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, college students experienced occupational disruptions to their daily routines and alarming mental health outcomes. This paper seeks to examine associations between college students' occupational engagement and psychological well-being;identify potential protective and risk factors for gender, race, and ethnic identities;and explore the impacts of occupational disruptions during COVID-19. Method: Undergraduate students (n = 152) were recruited through social media and ResearchMatch and completed an online survey. Associations and differential impacts on identity were analyzed for occupational balance, satisfaction with participation in discretionary activities, depression, fatigue, general anxiety, stress, loneliness, and COVID-19 behaviors, beliefs, and experiences (CBBE). Results: Occupational engagement had significant negative correlations with the five mental health measures. Females reported more fatigue, anxiety, and stress than males. Hispanic/Latinx participants reported greater occupational engagement. Black/African American participants reported greater occupational balance than their multiracial peers. Occupational Impairment subscale was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Participants who lost their job were more depressed. Males reported a greater increase in alcohol, cigarette, and recreational drug consumption than females. The COVID-19 Preventative Action subscale was positively correlated with COVID-19 Worry. Females both engaged in more preventive actions and worried more than males. Conclusion: Overall, this study reveals that increasing occupational engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic could be beneficial for mental health and well-being, that COVID-19 had differential impacts on occupational engagement and mental health outcomes based on identity, and that behaviors, beliefs, and experiences shifted with the global occupational disruption.","Tapia, V.; Isralowitz, E.

"The Effects of the Hybrid Telerehabilitation Exercise Program in Inactive University Students during COVID-19 Pandemic - A Randomized Controlled Study","Background/Aim The need for alternative methods to prevent physical inactivity and related problems is increasing day by day due to the prevalence of physical inactivity among university students, especially in the pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a hybrid telerehabilitation exercise program on the physical inactivity, poor sleep quality and physio-mental negativities caused by the pandemic in university students. Materials and Methods The study was completed with sixty-three physically inactive students with poor sleep quality, divided into two groups. The physiotherapist made all assessments at baseline and after the 6-week for both groups. Assessments consisted of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Short Form-12 (SF-12), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). While no exercise program was applied to the control group, one session synchronous exercise training and one session control education were given to the exercise group. After two synchronous training sessions, the exercise group asynchronously continued the exercise program including indoor walking, flexibility and strengthening exercises for 6 weeks. Results According to inter-groups analysis, PSQI (p=0.026), BDI (p=0.037), SF-12 Mental (p=0.007), and IPAQ-sitting (p=0.003) of the exercise group had significant differences compared to the control. Also, the exercise group's PSQI, BDI, SF-12, and IPAQ-sitting time were p&lt;0.001, while no change was observed in the control group in the within-group analysis (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion Hybrid telerehabilitation exercise programs are a valuable, simple, and practical tool to improve sleep quality, prevent inactivity, develop and protect mental health among university students. Encouraging physically inactive people to engage in such methods may be one of the primary preventive approach to prevent the future negative consequences.","Ozer, A. Y.; Senocak, E.; Aybey, B.

"A hybrid assessment framework for human-centred sustainable smart campus: A case study on COVID-19 impact","The continuous development of modern information and communication technologies is driving the smart revolution in the global education system. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has recently posed unprecedented challenges to educational institutes. The education informatisation technologies are playing a vital role to ensure the continuity and enhance the performance of education during the pandemic, which accelerates the integration of cutting-edge technologies and thus the overall development of the smart campus. Alongside the technological advancement, the existing studies indicate that the success of smart campus development mainly depends on three key dimensions: technology capability, sustainability, and student health and well-being. However, the state-of-the-art assessment on smart campus are mostly unilaterally dependent but lack a balanced evaluation of the three dimensions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a hybrid assessment framework that integrates all three key aspects, aiming to provide a multi-dimensional view of campus smartness for human-centred sustainable development. The smart campus assessment index resulting from the proposed framework is constructed under a limiting factor formulation to jointly model the individual contributions from the three dimensions as well as their trade-off relationship. The contribution from each dimension is the weighted normalised sum of a set of precisely selected indicators. A case study is also conducted on the historical data of a US university to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the assessment index in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which also demonstrates the rationality of the hybrid framework for smart campus assessment.","Yip, Christine, Zhang, Yuchen, Lu, Erwan, Dong, Zhao Yang","https://doi.org/10.1049/smc2.12038","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: IET Smart Cities; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36381,""
"PTSD Disability Examinations in the Department of Veterans Affairs: A Comparison of Telehealth and In-Person Exams","It is estimated that the VA will have rendered decisions on roughly 1.4 million disability claims in 2021. A substantial percentage of these are for mental health conditions, specifically posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations for PTSD were completed in-person;since March 2020, most have been conducted using telehealth. However, the content and quality of such exams, relative to those conducted in-person, have not been studied. The present study compared Initial PTSD examinations by telehealth to those completed in-person. Overall, 105 reports (51 in-person and 54 telehealth) were randomly selected from all Initial PTSD C&P exams completed within VA Connecticut between 2019 and 2020 (1 year preceding the pandemic and the first year of the pandemic). Raters were masked to all information indicating examiner, mode, and date of exam. Exam content was recorded, and exam quality was rated using three metrics that demonstrated adequate reliability and sensitivity in a prior study. There were no statistically significant differences between in-person and tele-exams on any relevant report content variables, report quality metrics, or VA disability rating outcomes. Results support the validity of the use of telehealth for conducting psychological exams for PTSD disability claims within the VA. Implications for the use of telehealth technology in improving operational breadth and reducing barriers to examination and care, both in the VA and beyond, are discussed.","Gianoli, M.

"Mobilizing digital technology to implement a population-based psychological support response during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lima, Peru","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic caused considerable burden on mental health worldwide. To address this emergency in Peru, Socios en Salud (SES) implemented an innovative digital system for the diagnosis and psychological therapy in vulnerable populations. We describe the development, implementation, and participant outcomes of this intervention. Methods. We conducted an intervention in a general population of Lima, Peru using a digital tool, ChatBot-Juntos, incorporating the abbreviated Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) to screen psychological distress. Participants positive for psychological distress received remote Psychological First Aid (PFA) and grief therapy if needed. Participants with a mental health condition or safety concern were referred to mental health services. SRQ scores were collected 3 months after PFA sessions. Differences between screening and follow-up scores were compared using Wilcoxon sign-rank test. Results. In total, 2027 people were screened;1581 (77.9%) screened positive for psychological distress. Nine hundred ninety-seven (63%) people with psychological distress received PFA, and 320 (32.1%) of those were also referred for mental health care. At 3 months after follow-up, SRQ scores were collected for 579 (58%) participants. Significant reduction in SRQ scores was observed 3 months after PFA [median SRQ score changed from 9 to 5 (p &lt; 0.001)], and after PFA plus referral to mental health services [median SRQ score changed from 11 to 6 (p &lt; 0.001)]. Conclusion. Digital technology can be used to screen for psychological distress and deliver mental health support for populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. More research is needed to determine whether technology contributes to improved mental health outcomes.","Santa-Cruz, J.; Moran, L.; Tovar, M.; Peinado, J.; Cutipe, Y.; Ramos, L.; Astupillo, A.; Rosler, M.; Raviola, G.; Lecca, L.; Smith, S.

"Changes in psychiatric services dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic: recognizing the need for resources shift","With the significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the health, and the functioning of health care system, it has become increasingly important to understand changes in the ways health services were utilized and the factors influencing it. Drop in psychiatric admissions was seen during the pandemic, but also an increase in acute hospitalizations and emergency visits. Our aim was to analyze changes in out- and in-patient services utilization in the largest Croatian psychiatric institution during the first year of the pandemic, observed through the lens of the stringency index, and compare it to the pre-pandemic year. Along with an overall drop in hospitalizations, but a unit-specific rise in hospitalization, we have observed a non-significant overall drop in regular outpatient visits, and a significant drop coinciding with strictest epidemiological measures. There was also a significant increase in emergency visits coinciding with epidemiological measures that failed to return to pre-pandemic values, pointing to an expected significant and prolonged burden on emergency services. Simultaneous analysis of changing dynamics of mental health care service utilization during the pandemic helps us identify specific points of increased burden, and help us plan for early and flexible resources shift in order to adequately respond to evolving challenges.","Savic, Aleksandar, Vukojevic, JakÅ¡a, Mitrekovic, Ivan, Bagaric, Mihovil, Å tajduhar, Andrija, Henigsberg, Neven, Brecic, Petrana","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114778","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114778, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36384,""
"Brief screening measures of mental health for war-related dysfunctional anxiety and negative persistent thinking","As per previous research, war causes exposure to trauma not only among its participants and refugees, but also broader groups that are influenced by mass media coverage of the war. In addition, according to other reports, dysfunctional anxiety and negative persistent thinking may be clear indicators of mental health in the face of crisis. The purpose of this study was to construct and initially evaluate the psychometric properties of the War Anxiety Scale (WAS) and the War Persistent Thinking Scale (WPTS). The study included 553 Poles between the ages of 18 and 81 (57% of whom were women), and 216 Ukrainian war refugees aged 18-61 (79% of whom were women) who came to Poland. Both scales showed a single-factor structure with strong internal consistency (alpha is an element of &lt;0.83;0.93&gt;). WAS and WPTS scores positively correlated with measures of symptoms for posttraumatic stress disorder, depressiveness, and nuclear concern, and negatively correlated with measures of mental resilience and nuclear support. The data obtained indicate that WAS and WPTS are effective and valid tools in clinical research and practice.","Surzykiewicz, J.; Skalski, S.

"Evaluation of the relationship between anxiety and nutritional habits in Turkish patients with multiple sclerosis during the Covid-19 outbreak; AvaliaÃ§Ã£o da relaÃ§Ã£o entre ansiedade e hÃ¡bitos nutricionais em pacientes urcos com esclerose mÃºltipla durante o surto da Covid-19","ABSTRACT  Objective The Coronavirus disease 2019 is a global public health problem that has led to psychological disorders (depression, anxiety, etc.), especially in fragile individuals such as those affected by multiple sclerosis. This study investigated the relationship between anxiety and nutritional habits during the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in multiple sclerosis patients.  Methods This cross-sectional study was an online survey of multiple sclerosis patients living in Turkey. The total sample consisted of 294 multiple sclerosis patients. A questionnaire containing general demographic data, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and nutritional attitudes and habits was applied to multiple sclerosis patients.  Results Moderate or severe anxiety scores were found in 42.2% of multiple sclerosis patients. Weight gain was reported in 40.5% of them during the outbreak. A statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of individuals' Beck Anxiety Inventory scores for consumption of nuts/seeds, rice/pasta, cake/cookies, and water. A 1-unit increase in Beck Anxiety Inventory scores led to a 1.04 times increased consumption of bread and rice/pasta and a 1.05 times increased consumption of cake/cookies either before or after controlling for potential confounders. A 1-unit increase in Beck Anxiety Inventory scores led to a 1.06 times decreased consumption of water and a 1.04 times decreased consumption of meat and poultry, fruit (fresh), and rice/pasta, either before or after controlling for potential confounders.  Conclusion During the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, anxiety led to changes in multiple sclerosis patients' nutritional habits and food preferences. The continuous surveillance of psychological consequences and nutritional counseling during outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.; RESUMO  Objetivo A doenÃ§a do CoronavÃ­rus - 2019, causada pelo Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), Ã© um problema de saÃºde pÃºblica global e tem levado os indivÃ­duos desenvolverem distÃºrbios psicolÃ³gicos (depressÃ£o, ansiedade, etc.), especialmente indivÃ­duos frÃ¡geis, como aqueles afetados por esclerose mÃºltipla.

"Urban greenspace and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A 20-month follow up of 19,848 participants in England","This study examined the association between greenspace and the growth trajectories of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from 19,848 urban residents in England who were followed for 20 months between March 2020 and October 2021, we found that living in an area with higher greenspace coverage (exposure) was associated with fewer anxiety symptoms independent of population density, area deprivation levels, socio-demographics, and health profiles. There was limited evidence that greenspace was related to the change of anxiety symptoms over time. No association with anxiety trajectories was found when considering distance to nearest greenspace (proximity), highlighting potentially differential mental health effects of simply having access to local parks and recreation areas versus living in areas of greater natural environment land cover. These findings have important implications for mental health intervention and policymaking.","Bu, Mak, Steptoe, Wheeler, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2022.102897","20220822","Anxiety; COVID-19; Greenspace; Nature; Panel data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36387,""
"Infodemic of covid-19 and repercussions on the mental health of the elderly from SÃƒÂ£o Paulo","To characterize and identify depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress associated with the COVID-19 Infodemic in the elderly from SÃƒÂ£o Paulo. Exploratory and cross-sectional study with the elderly in the capital of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo who had internet access. The sociodemographic profile, the COVID-19 infodemic, depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety were analyzed. A total of 411 older people participated in the study. There was a predominance of women (76.4%), with higher education (57.9%), using private health services, and with little income variation. Older people were more exposed to news or information about COVID-19 on the internet (45.3%), followed by television (34.5%), and radio (11.4%). The average stress was 19.96 points; 33.1% had anxiety, and 39.7% had depressive symptoms. The greater the number of people living with the elderly, the greater the stress (p = 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.02). The hours of exposure to information on the internet led to stress (p = 0.001), depressive symptoms (p = 0.02), and anxiety (p = 0.02) in the elderly. During the pandemic, exposure to information on the internet triggered anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms in the elderly. The findings highlight the need for multi and interdisciplinary interventions to mitigate such repercussions on the elderly's health.","Fhon, PÃƒÂ¼schel, Cavalcante, Cruz, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Li, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-220X-REEUSP-2021-0421en","20220822","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36388,""

With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening the health, wellbeing, and economic circumstances of people around the world, this study aims to assess the impacts of the pandemic on YEH in Toronto, Ontario, as well as to identify recommendations for future waves of COVID-19. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with YEH (ages 16-24, n = 45) and staff who work in one of four downtown emergency shelters for youth (n = 31) in Toronto, Ontario. YEH experienced both structural changes and psychosocial impacts resulting from the pandemic. Structural changes included a reduction in services, barriers to employment and housing, and changes to routines. Psychosocial outcomes included isolation, worsened mental health, and increased substance use. Impacts were magnified and distinct for subpopulations of youth, including for youth that identified as Black, 2SLGBTQ+, or those new to Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic increased distress among YEH while also limiting access to services. There is therefore a need to balance health and safety with continued access to in-person services, and to shift the response to youth homelessness to focus on prevention, housing, and equitable supports for subpopulations of youth.","Noble, Owens, Thulien, Suleiman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273502","20220822","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36390,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Global Delivery of Mental Health Services and Telemental Health: Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic required mental health services around the world to adapt quickly to the new restrictions and regulations put in place to reduce the risk of transmission. As face-to-face contact became difficult, virtual methods were implemented to continue to safely provide mental health care. However, it is unclear to what extent service provision transitioned to telemental health worldwide. We aimed to systematically review the global research literature on how mental health service provision adapted during the first year of the pandemic. We searched systematically for quantitative papers focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health services published until April 13, 2021, in the PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and bioXriv electronic bibliographic databases, using the COVID-19 Open Access Project online platform. The screening process and data extraction were independently completed by at least two authors, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion with a senior member of the team. The findings were summarized narratively in the context of each country's COVID-19 Stringency Index, which reflects the stringency of a government's response to COVID-19 restrictions at a specific time. Of the identified 24,339 records, 101 papers were included after the screening process. Reports on general services (n=72) showed that several countries' face-to-face services reduced their activities at the start of the pandemic, with reductions in the total number of delivered visits and with some services forced to close. In contrast, telemental health use rapidly increased in many countries across the world at the beginning of the pandemic (n=55), with almost complete virtualization of general and specialistic care services by the end of the first year. Considering the reported COVID-19 Stringency Index values, the increased use of virtual means seems to correspond to periods when the Stringency Index values were at their highest in several countries. However, due to specific care requirements, telemental health could not be used in certain subgroups of patients, such as those on clozapine or depot treatments and those who continued to need face-to-face visits. During the pandemic, mental health services had to adapt quickly in the short term, implementing or increasing the use of telemental health services across the globe. Limited access to digital means, poor digital skills, and patients' preferences and individual needs may have contributed to differences in implementing and accessing telemental health services during the pandemic. In the long term, a blended approach, combining in-person and virtual modalities, that takes into consideration the needs, preferences, and digital skills of patients may better support the future development of mental health services. It will be required to improve confidence with digital device use, training, and experience in all modalities for both clinicians and service users.","Zangani, Ostinelli, Smith, Hong, Macdonald, Reen, Reid, Vincent, Syed Sheriff, Harrison, Hawton, Pitman, Bale, Fazel, Geddes, Cipriani","https://doi.org/10.2196/38600","20220822","COVID-19; coronavirus; face-to-face; mental health services; telemental health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36391,""

"The effectiveness of traffic and production restrictions on urban air quality: a rare opportunity for investigation","Traffic and production restrictions are two important emergency measures for controlling urban air pollution. The lockdown policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic period are nearly equivalent to the policies of traffic and production restriction, which provides a rare opportunity to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of these emergency measures. Taking Wuhan, China as the study area, this paper firstly verified the changes in six air pollutants and analyzed their change rules in different lockdown periods using statistical methods. Then the structural breakpoints in air pollutants were detected via regression discontinuity design model. To comprehensively understand the effects of restrictions on air pollution, the influences of meteorological conditions on air pollution were also investigated. The results illustrated that the concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> decreased significantly during lockdown period. By comparing with the RDD coefficients of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (-34.46), PM<sub>10</sub> (-37.11) and NO<sub>2</sub> (-19.15), the lockdown had little effect on CO (-0.32). The traffic and production restrictions had no apparent effects on SO<sub>2</sub>. Although O<sub>3</sub> showed an increasing trend, the increase was not limited to the lockdown period, meaning that the traffic and production restrictions had less effect on the increasing trend of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Moreover, the structural breakpoints were verified in four air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO), and the structural breakpoints were caused by lockdown instead of the Spring Festival. The results also indicated that the meteorological conditions were not the main reasons for the changes in air pollutants during the lockdown period. This paper reveals how the traffic and production restrictions affect urban air pollution and provides a strong implementation basis for the air pollution control policy.","Chen, Wang, ElAmraoui, Guo, Ke","https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2022.2115161","20220822","Spring Festival effect; Structural breakpoints; Traffic and production restrictions; Urban air pollution","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36395,""

At the end of the program all participants completed a survey. A total of 108 surveys were completed (67.6% male; 32.4% female). Despite the difficult moment of lockdown and the fear linked to the pandemic, 61.9% of interviewed subjects declared a state of general well-being from fair to good linked to the practice of mindfulness. Female subjects (p=0.001), married subjects (p=0.05) and people taking pharmacologic therapy demonstrated (p=0.009) significant improvement in daily management of emotions and practical requests during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Mindfulness meditation may be effective in helping people to regulate emotions and to support their mental health during this period of worry and uncertainty.","Borghi, NisticÃƒÂ², Marano, Janiri, Sani, Mazza","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202208_29427","20220822","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36396,""
"From best practice to next practice: implementing Comprehensive School Health in rural and remote northern communities","Northern communities in Canada experience a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases including mental illness. To mitigate the growing health inequalities, an ongoing Comprehensive School Health program promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours and mental health and well-being was expanded to rural and remote northern communities. We report on the program's impact on knowledge, attitudes, lifestyle behaviours (healthy eating, physical activity, screen time), weight status and the mental health and well-being of elementary school students during the first four years of implementation. Following a repeated cross-sectional design, we surveyed 440, 352 and 384 Grade 4 to 6 students (9-12 years old) from eight schools in 2016, 2018 and 2020/21, respectively. Students were approximately equally represented by girls and boys. Between 2016 and 2018, students reported modest increases in vegetable and fruit consumption and dietary variety; declines in screen time; no changes in physical activity; and declines in attitudes toward healthy lifestyle and in mental health and well-being. Between 2018 and 2020/21, lifestyle behaviours deteriorated substantially, while attitudes and mental health and well-being continued to decline. A program that was successful in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods had a favourable, though modest, impact on selected lifestyle behaviours, but not on attitudes and mental health and well-being, in rural and remote northern communities. In light of cultural differences and logistical challenges in Canada's North, systematic and proactive adaptations to local contexts, increased intensity, and longer program delivery are essential to facilitate sustainable improvements in lifestyle behaviours and mental health and well-being. Les collectivitÃƒÂ©s du Nord du Canada sont touchÃƒÂ©es dans une mesure disproportionnÃƒÂ©e par les maladies chroniques, en particulier les maladies mentales. Pour attÃƒÂ©nuer les inÃƒÂ©galitÃƒÂ©s croissantes en matiÃƒÂ¨re de santÃƒÂ©, un programme de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Approche globale de la santÃƒÂ© en milieu scolaire ciblant les comportements liÃƒÂ©s au mode de vie sain, la santÃƒÂ© mentale et le bienÃ‚Â­ÃƒÂªtre, a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©tendu aux collectivitÃƒÂ©s rurales et ÃƒÂ©loignÃƒÂ©es du Nord. Nous rendons compte de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢incidence du programme sur les connaissances, les attitudes, les comportements liÃƒÂ©s au mode de vie (alimentation saine, activitÃƒÂ© physique, temps passÃƒÂ© devant un ÃƒÂ©cran), le poids, la santÃƒÂ© mentale et le bienÃ‚Â­ÃƒÂªtre dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ves dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©cole primaire au cours des quatre premiÃƒÂ¨res annÃƒÂ©es de mise en Ã…â€œuvre. Suivant un plan transversal rÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©, nous avons interrogÃƒÂ© 440 ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ves de la 4e Ãƒ la 6e annÃƒÂ©e (9 Ãƒ 12 ans) de huit ÃƒÂ©coles en 2016, 352 en 2018 et 384 en 2020Ã‚Â­2021. La rÃƒÂ©partition entre filles et garÃƒÂ§ons parmi les ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ves ÃƒÂ©tait presque ÃƒÂ©gale. Entre 2016 et 2018, les rÃƒÂ©ponses des ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ves ont rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ© des augmentations modestes dans la consommation de fruits et lÃƒÂ©gumes et dans la diversitÃƒÂ© des aliments, une diminution du temps passÃƒÂ© devant les ÃƒÂ©crans, aucun changement dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢activitÃƒÂ© physique, un recul des attitudes en faveur dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un mode de vie sain ainsi quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une baisse de la santÃƒÂ© mentale et du bienÃ‚Â­ÃƒÂªtre. Entre 2018 et 2020Ã‚Â­2021, les comportements liÃƒÂ©s au mode de vie se sont considÃƒÂ©rablement dÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©riorÃƒÂ©s, tandis que les attitudes, la santÃƒÂ© mentale et le bienÃ‚Â­ÃƒÂªtre ont continuÃƒÂ© Ãƒ dÃƒÂ©cliner. Un programme ayant connu du succÃƒÂ¨s dans les quartiers urbains dÃƒÂ©favorisÃƒÂ©s sur le plan socioÃƒÂ©conomique a eu, dans les collectivitÃƒÂ©s rurales et ÃƒÂ©loignÃƒÂ©es du Nord, une incidence favorable, bien que modeste, sur certains comportements liÃƒÂ©s au mode de vie, mais pas sur les attitudes ni sur la santÃƒÂ© mentale ou le bienÃ‚Â­ÃƒÂªtre. Ãƒâ‚¬ la lumiÃƒÂ¨re des diffÃƒÂ©rences culturelles et des dÃƒÂ©fis logistiques du Nord canadien, des adaptations systÃƒÂ©matiques et proactives aux contextes locaux, une intensitÃƒÂ© accrue et une prestation prolongÃƒÂ©e des programmes sont essentielles afin de faciliter des amÃƒÂ©liorations durables en matiÃƒÂ¨re de santÃƒÂ© mentale, de bienÃ‚Â­ÃƒÂªtre et de comportements liÃƒÂ©s au mode de vie. A school-based health promotion program targeting lifestyle behaviours and mental health and well-beingÃ¢â‚¬â€APPLE SchoolsÃ¢â‚¬â€has been implemented in rural and remote northern Canadian communities to improve health and mitigate health inequalities. Surveys among Grade 4 to 6 students in 2016, 2018 and 2020/21 revealed initial modest improvements in lifestyle behaviours that dissipated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Attitudes toward health and healthy lifestyles did not improve between 2016 and 2020/21. Systematic and proactive adaptations and increased intensity and duration of health promotion programming are essential to yield substantive and sustainable improvements in lifestyle behaviours, and mental health and well-being in CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s North.

"University students' risk perception, protective measures, and general health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","This study aimed to investigate university students' risk perception, protective measures, and general health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. The research sample consisted of 1920 university students. The data were collected through an online questionnaire. 56.6% of the students considered their risk of being infected with the COVID-19. The number of measures taken by students was lower than expected. Students' increased anxiety perceived individual risk level, insufficient social support perceptions, and their perceptions of the current pandemic more serious than previous epidemics affect the number of measures they take.Students had sleep and study problems, and suicidal thoughts in the social isolation period. Sex, studying in medicine, anxiety related to COVID-19, feeling unconfident in coping with pandemic, social support, were determined to be risk factors regarding general health, sleep and study problems, and suicidal thought. The results of the study showed that the measures taken by university students were insufficient and the precautions were affected by many factors. It was determined that their health was adversely affected by the pandemic. University administrations and decision-makers should consider the risk factors to improve the students' experiences in such pandemics and emergencies.","Duygulu, Kuruca-Ozdemir, Erdat, Kocoglu-Tanyer","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.216","20220822","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional; Mental Health; Pandemic; Physical Health; Protective measures; Risk perception; University Student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36398,""
"Food Insecurity-Related Interventions and Mental Health Among US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic, April 2020 through August 2021","Financial hardships, job losses, and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic have increased food insecurity. We examined associations between food insecurity-related interventions and mental health among US adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years from April 2020 through August 2021. We pooled data from the Household Pulse Survey from April 2020 through August 2021 (N = 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°253Ã¢â‚¬â€°567 adults). To estimate associations between mental health and food insecurity, we examined the following interventions: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Economic Impact Payments (stimulus funds), unemployment insurance, and free meals. We calculated psychological distress index (PDI) scores (Cronbach ÃŽÂ± = 0.91) through principal components analysis using 4 mental health variables: depression, anxiety, worry, and lack of interest (with a standardized mean score [SD] = 100 [20]). We conducted multivariable linear regression to estimate the interactive effects of the intervention and food insecurity on psychological distress, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. During the study period, adults with food insecurity had higher mean PDI scores than adults without food insecurity. Food insecurity was associated with increased PDI scores after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. In stratified models, negative associations between food insecurity and mental health (as shown by reductions in PDI scores) were mitigated by SNAP (-4.5), stimulus fund (-4.1), unemployment insurance (-4.4), and free meal (-4.4) interventions. The mitigation effects of interventions on PDI were greater for non-Hispanic White adults than for non-Hispanic Black or Asian adults. Future research on food insecurity and mental health should include investigations on programs and policies that could be of most benefit to racial and ethnic minority groups.","Lee, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549221110294","20220822","COVID-19; SNAP; food insecurity; psychological distress index; stimulus fund","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36399,""
"COVID Academic Pandemic: Techno Stress Faced by Teaching Staff for Online Academic Activities","This paper analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the teachers, specifically the techno stress arising in them as a result of issues faced by them in the use of technology when they conduct the online academic activities. It aims to assess the major factors related to the online teaching that specifically adds to techno stress on the teachers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, the study aims to provide suggestions to the policymakers and the management of the universities so that the effect of the COVID-19's on teachers' mental health and the related techno stress can be reduced. This paper is a literature review of the articles on the notion of techno stress on teachers and their mental health by searching the related articles with these terminologies using the renowned search engines of Google Scholar and Web of Science. A combination of the terms such as Coronavirus, COVID-19, mental health, psychological distress, techno stress, and online teaching were used in the article search for the review. The literature has suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly affected the mental health of the employees in general and specifically, the teachers who are engaged in online academic activities and teaching in the universities. The paper has identified a few factors that are the cause of the techno stress and provides recommendations for the university management and the policy makers for minimizing their negative impact on the teachers, in terms of the techno stress and their mental health. Coronavirus is a new strain of the viruses that has badly engulfed the entire population of the world. It is even now badly rising and causing deaths while this article is in the writing phase. The article has addressed the mental health concerns of the university teachers as they are now working from home using ICT for delivering the lectures and conducting the online teaching and learning activities for the students at their universities. This is a matter of grave importance now and requires immediate attention. Hence, this article broadens the scope of the research on the corona virus and its impact on the university teachers.","Zheng, Asif, Tufail, Naseer, Khokhar, Chen, Naveed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.895371","20220822","COVID-19; coronavirus; mental health; online teaching; psychological distress; techno stress; university teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36400,""
"Problems or prospects? Being a parent in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, many restrictions hit people in ways never seen before. Mental wellbeing was affected and burden was high, especially for high-risk groups such as parents. However, to our knowledge no research has yet examined whether being a parent was not only a risk for psychological burden but also a way to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was used to collect data from 1,121 participants from April to June 2020. In addition to demographic variables, risk factors (financial burden, problems complying with COVID-19 restrictions, and pre-treatment due to mental health problems) and protective factors (emotion regulation, humor, and crisis self-efficacy) were collected. The dataset was divided into three groups: parents whose children lived at home (<i>n</i> = 395), parents whose children did not (no longer) live at home (<i>n</i> = 165), and people who were not parents (<i>n</i> = 561). A linear mixed effect model showed that parents had no higher burden than non-parents, and even less when children did not live at home. Expected risk factors were generally less important, and there were no differences between parents and non-parents. In contrast, parents had advantages in protective factors. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was shown that parents (with and without their children at home) were not necessarily at risk due to additional burden, but also had prospects of coping better with the situation than people without children.","Ecker, Jarvers, Schleicher, Kandsperger, Schelhorn, Meyer, Borchert, LÃƒÂ¼dtke, Shiban","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.901249","20220822","COVID-19; parents; protective factors; psychological burden; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36401,""
"Do preschool teachers in Southwest China need more mental health education? An online cross-sectional survey 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic","This study intended to explore the current status of psychological problems of preschool teachers in Southwest China 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the association between mental health education and psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology. A total of 614 preschool teachers from Southwest China were enrolled to complete the questionnaires of the Chinese Symptom Checklist (SCL-90). Notably, 60% of the respondents reported psychological distress with GSI T-scores Ã¢â€°Â¥ 63, especially the high score was reported on obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, and phobic anxiety.

"Effects of animated pedagogical agent-guided loving-kindness meditation on flight attendants' spirituality, mindfulness, subjective wellbeing, and social presence","Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) was first practiced by Buddhists and then developed by clinical psychologist. Previous studies on LKM have mainly focused on the impact of real person-guided meditation on depression, anxiety, and other negative psychology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explored the effect and mechanism of media-guided LKM on the improvement of social presence, mindfulness, spirituality, and subjective wellbeing (SWB). From the viewpoint of positive psychology, this study compared the different media effects of animated pedagogical agent (APA)-guided LKM and audio-guided LKM. A total of 82 flight attendants were recruited from airlines; then, they were randomly assigned to two groups: APA group (41 participants) and audio group (41 participants), which both underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention. The aforementioned four main variables were measured pre and post the meditation experiment. The results indicated that both APA-guided meditation and audio-guided meditation significantly improved subjects' spirituality and SWB. Compared with audio-guided meditation, APA-guided meditation significantly improved the subjects' spirituality, SWB, and social presence. Audio-guided meditation has no significant effect on social presence. This study highlights APA-guided meditation has a positive effect on spirituality, SWB, and social presence, which may provide individuals with a simple and easy method to improve their mental health.","Liu, Chen, Zhou, Chiang, Chen, Wu, Huang, Liu, Chiou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.894220","20220822","animation guidance; loving-kindness meditation; mindfulness; spirituality; subjective wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36403,""
"Pandemic Fatigue in Nursing Undergraduates: Role of Individual Resilience and Coping Styles in Health Promotion","The COVID-19 pandemic was soon declared a global health threat and had significant economic and health implications. Unprecedented government measures brought massive shifts in teaching-learning pedagogy in nursing to curb the infection. The study was conducted to explore the predictors of pandemic fatigue among nursing undergraduates and mediating role of individual resilience and coping styles during the third wave in India. This online survey included 256 undergraduate nursing students studying at Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in North India. Lockdown/Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, and Coping Behavior Questionnaire were used to collect the information. Appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to compute the results. Nursing undergraduates reported a moderate level of fatigue during the restrictions imposed at the time of the third wave. Students' year of study (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), tested positive during pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), and post-COVID-19 hospitalization (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.026) were found associated with higher fatigue status. Advanced age (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.046) and higher personal resilience status (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were associated with lower fatigue levels.

Findings suggest that lockdown-related fatigue was common in nursing undergraduates. Considering negative consequences on mental health, routine psychosocial screening of the nursing students should be conducted. Recommending stress-relieving measures should be enforced to help nursing undergraduates to combat lockdown-induced exhaustion.","Kumar, Beniwal, Bahurupi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.940544","20220822","COVID-19; coping; fatigue; nursing; resilience; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36404,""
"The case for change: aviation worker wellbeing during the COVID 19 pandemic, and the need for an integrated health and safety culture","The workplace is an important setting for health protection, health promotion and disease prevention. Currently, health and wellbeing approaches at an aviation organisational level are not addressing both human and safety needs. This issue has been intensified since the COVID 19 pandemic. This paper reports on the findings of a survey pertaining to aviation worker wellbeing and organisational approaches to managing wellbeing and mental health. The survey was administered at two different time periods during the COVID 19 pandemic (2020 and 2021). Collectively, feedback was obtained from over 3000 aviation workers. Survey feedback indicates that aviation workers are experiencing considerable challenges in relation to their health and wellbeing. These challenges are not being adequately addressed at an organisational level, which creates risk both from an individual and flight safety perspective. The descriptive findings of both surveys along with a regression analysis is used to make a principled case for augmenting the existing approach to managing aviation worker wellbeing (including mental health), at both an organisational and regulatory level. It is argued that aviation organisations, with the support of the regulator should implement a preventative, ethical and evidence-based strategy to managing wellbeing and mental health risk. Critically, aviation organisations need to advance and integrated health, wellbeing, and safety culture. This necessitates an alignment of human, business, and safety objectives, as articulated in concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and responsible work. Critically, this approach depends on trust and the specification of appropriate protections, so that aviation workers feel safe to routinely report wellbeing levels and challenges, and their impact on operational safety.","Cahill, Cullen, Gaynor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-022-00711-5","20220822","Airline safety management systems; Aviation workers; Culture; Mental health; Safety; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36405,""
"Anxiety and Stress Seem Temporary during the Pneumonia COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey on the Mental Health Status of Healthcare Workers","To evaluate the presence/severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among health care workers (HCWs) who work on the specially allocated COVID-19 ward (Group A) and HCWs on the other wards (Group B). This questionnaire-based study was conducted from January 25 to February 28, 2021. The mental status was assessed using the Persian version of the 42-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress score (DASS-42). Gathered data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. The independent T-test and Chi-square tests were used to compare quantitative and qualitative variables. Two-hundred and twenty two questionnaires were eligible for analysis. Group A consisted of 33 HCWs, and 189 (85.1%) individuals were working on the other wards. No statistically significant differences were seen regarding the Socio-demographic features except for the marital status (<i>p</i>=0.005). The depressions' mean score was comparable between group A and B (<i>p</i>=0.102). The mean scores of anxiety and stress were significantly lower in group A than group B (<i>p</i>=0.006), although the frequency of DASS-42 parameters did not differ between these two groups (<i>p</i>&gt;0.05). Contrary to our assumptions, this study showed that the DASS-42 parameters were not higher in HCWs working on the COVID-19 wards. This might be justified by developing coping mechanisms, being on the honeymoon phase of the disaster, compassion satisfaction, promising vaccine news, and working on the less impacted hospital.","Abdolrahimzadeh Fard, Borazjani, Shams, Rezaee, Aminnia, Salimi, Ahadi, Paydar, Bolandparvaz, Rabiei, Zare, Shayan, Sadeghi","https://doi.org/10.30476/BEAT.2022.94720.1344","20220822","Anxiety; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Pandemic; Pneumonia; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36406,""
"The importance for wellbeing of having views of nature from and in the home during the COVID-19 pandemic Results from the GreenCOVID study","The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the daily lives of people and may affect their well-being. The aim of the present study is to assess well-being and associated factors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population in three European countries. GreenCOVID was an observational cross-sectional study using an online survey (7 April 2020 to 24 July 2020) promoted by the Health &amp; Territory Research (HTR) of the University of Seville in Spain, Maynooth University in Ireland, and the University of Winchester in England, which included a sample of 3109 unselected adults. Well-being was measured using the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) scale. Seven aspects, related to the natural environment of the home, were evaluated (role of outdoor views in coping with lockdown, importance of blue spaces during lockdown, importance of green spaces during lockdown, quality of view from home, use of outdoor spaces or window views, elements of nature in the home, and views of green or blue spaces from home). Binary logistic regression was conducted to identify the parameters associated with poor well-being. Mean age was 39.7 years and 79.3% lived in Spain, the majority in urban areas (92.8%). 73.0% were female and 72.0% had undertaken university studies. Poor well-being was reported by 59.0%, while 26.6% indicated the possible presence of clinical depression. The factors most associated with poor well-being were students (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.541), those who had no engagement in physical activity (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.389), those who reported 'living in Spain' compared to Ireland (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.724), being female (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.256), poor quality views from home (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.887), less benefit from views of the natural environment to cope with lockdown (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.964), and those younger in age (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.990).

"Prefrontal reactivity to TMS perturbation as a toy model of mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychosocial hardships associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led many individuals to suffer adverse mental health consequences, however, others show no negative effects. We hypothesized that the electroencephalographic (EEG) response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could serve as a toy-model of an individual's capacity to resist psychological stress, in this case linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from 74 participants who underwent mental health monitoring and concurrent electroencephalography with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) and left inferior parietal lobule (L-IPL). Within the following 19 months, mental health was reassessed at three timepoints during lock-down confinement and different phases of de-escalation in Spain. Compared with participants who remained stable, those who experienced increased mental distress showed, months earlier, significantly larger late EEG responses locally after L-DLPFC stimulation (but not globally nor after L-IPL stimulation). This response, together with years of formal education, was significantly predictive of mental health status during the pandemic. These findings reveal that the effect of TMS perturbation offers a predictive toy model of psychosocial stress response, as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic.","PerellÃƒÂ³n-Alfonso, Redondo-CamÃƒÂ³s, Abellaneda-PÃƒÂ©rez, Cattaneo, Delgado-GallÃƒÂ©n, EspaÃƒÂ±a-Irla, Solana SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Tormos, Pascual-Leone, BartrÃƒÂ©s-Faz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10208","20220822","COVID-19; Mental health; Resilience; TMS-EEG","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36408,""
"Mental Health, Material Possessions, and Social Capital During COVID-19: A Study of the United States Urban Working-Age Population","This study evaluates the associations between the urban working-age population's mental health, material possession, and social capital during the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific stressors examined in this empirical analysis are income level, food insecurity, and virtual psychological support. This paper further examines the differences across the employed and unemployed population groups. We obtained data from the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey and constructed four measures of mental health conditions: Nervous, Depressed, Lonely, and Hopeless. Our empirical analyses use an ordinal regression model that takes both time and regional factors into consideration to control for potential time effects and time-invariant confounders that only vary between regions. For the employed group, the main results suggest that lower income and food insecurity is correlated with a higher frequency of mental health symptoms, while virtual psychological support predicts a better mental health status. For the unemployed group, food insecurity is negatively associated with mental health, and virtual psychological might help alleviate nervousness and depression.","Fan, Nie, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11482-022-10093-5","20220822","COVID-19; Food Insecurity; Income Level; Urban Population; Virtual Psychological Support, Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36409,""
"Effect of Nurses' Work Experiences in a COVID-19 Unit on Depression: Mediation Effect of Resilience and Moderated Mediation Effect of Organizational Trust","Nurses work with a lack of organizational support and perceive an unsafe environment from their organizations, which has been related to depression. This study aimed to investigate the effect of nurses' work experiences in a COVID-19 unit on their depression, the mediation effect of resilience, and the moderated mediation effect of organizational trust. Participants were 132 nurses working at a general hospital. Through questionnaires, data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzed using SPSS 25.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro. Mean resilience was 2.15 Ã‚Â± 0.76; mean organizational trust was 3.03 Ã‚Â± 0.74; mean depression was 0.76 Ã‚Â± 0.63. 65.6% nurses with work experience in a COVID-19 unit had depression. Of the 27.2% nurses who showed moderate or higher levels of depression. Nurses' work experiences in a COVID-19 unit had a direct effect on depression and indirectly affected depression via resilience as a mediator. Resilience had a partial mediation effect, and organizational trust had a significant moderated mediation effect in the path from nurses' work experiences in a COVID-19 unit to depression mediated by resilience. This study emphasizes the key role that healthcare organizations play in providing sufficient support to nursing staff to protect them from depression by improving nurses' resilience and organizational trust during the pandemic. Healthcare organizations need to develop a systematic structure to provide organizational support to nurses so that the organizational trust and resilience of nurses can be maximized.","Doo, Choi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.897506","20220822","COVID-19 infection; depression; nurses; organizational trust; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36410,""
"Eighteen months into the COVID-19 pandemic: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in Southeast Asia and the associated demographic factors","Mental health has become a growing concern in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine the prevalence of mental health symptoms 18 months after the pandemic's declaration. Our cross-sectional study conducted among 18- to 65-year-old adults (<i>N</i> = 33,454) in October 2021 using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) found a high prevalence of severe to extremely severe anxiety (49%), depression (47%) and stress (36%) symptoms in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore. Multiple logistic regression showed that female and non-binary genders were associated with increased odds of severe/extremely severe symptoms of anxiety (female: aOR 1.44 [95% CI 1.37-1.52]; non-binary aOR 1.46 [1.16-1.84]), depression (female: aOR 1.39 [1.32-1.47]; non-binary aOR 1.42 [1.13-1.79]), and stress (female: aOR 1.48 [CI 1.40-1.57]; non-binary aOR 1.42 [1.12-1.78]). In all three symptom domains, the odds of severe/extremely severe symptoms decreased across age groups. Middle- and high-income respondents had lower odds of reporting severe/extremely severe anxiety (middle-income: aOR 0.79 [0.75-0.84]; high-income aOR 0.77 [0.69-0.86]) and depression (middle-income: aOR 0.85 [0.80-0.90]; high-income aOR 0.84 [0.76-0.94]) symptoms compared to low-income respondents, while only middle-income respondents had lower odds of experiencing severe/extremely severe stress symptoms (aOR 0.89 [0.84-0.95]). Compared to residents of Malaysia, residents of Indonesia were more likely to experience severe/extremely severe anxiety symptoms (aOR 1.08 [1.03-1.15]) but less likely to experience depression (aOR 0.69 [0.65-0.73]) or stress symptoms (aOR 0.92 [0.87-0.97]). Respondents living in Singapore had increased odds of reporting severe/extremely severe depression symptoms (aOR 1.33 [1.16-1.52]), while respondents residing in Thailand were more likely to experience severe/extremely severe stress symptoms (aOR 1.46 [1.37-1.55]).

"Playing for Resilience in a Pandemic; Exploring the Role of an Online Board Game in Recognising Resources","In the current climate of Covid-19 and world-wide social distancing, the mental health toll has been widely reported, with an expectation that the negative impact will last beyond the lockdowns. Facing the prospect of an unknown future and continuing challenges, resilience is both topical and necessary. With a call for digitally delivered interventions to help people affected by the pandemic, this study explores how playing an online positive psychology-informed board game supported people to recognise resources for resilience. Sixteen multi-national participants played in groups of 3-4 and qualitative data, collected via focus groups, was analysed using Thematic Analysis. Participants described a broadening of resources, primarily through reflecting on and remembering prior strategies and successes. Four themes are identified which, it is suggested, facilitated this in a sequential, upward spiral; the game mechanisms (release), psychological safety (reflect), meaningful conversations (remember) and anchoring of prior experiences (reuse). Critically, this study suggests that psychological safety may have been amplified by the online environment, which participants suggested enabled them to engage without interruption or inhibition. Additionally, whilst not part of the original intervention, the post-game reflection played an essential role in meaning-making and transferring learning into real-life. Future research into how online environments might not just facilitate but augment interventions is recommended. Finally, this study calls for further research into the impact of playful positive psychology interventions, suggesting a potential development of 'serious play' towards 'seriously positive play'.","Maresch, Kampman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41042-022-00069-z","20220822","Covid-19; Online board games; Positive psychology; Positive psychology interventions; Resilience; Serious play","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36412,""
"Relationship between mental health and the quality of sleep during the first self-restraint in Japanese workers: a cross-sectional survey","A few surveys have indicated that behavioural restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have affected sleep and mental health. This study examined (1) the change in sleep-wake habits before and during the first self-restraint in Japan, (2) the factors that affect mental health, and (3) the model of mental health affecting the sleep quality, of workers. A cross-sectional internet survey. A total of 512 Japanese workers self-assessed their sleep quality, loneliness, anxiety, and depression during self-restraint. Their previous sleep habits were also assessed. Sleep habits remained almost regular, but 35.7% of participants reported poor sleep quality. Additionally, among the participants, 82.2% reported social loneliness, 37.9% reported emotional loneliness, 25.6% reported anxiety moods, and 49.0% reported depressive moods. Anxiety and depression were influenced by emotional and social loneliness, and marital status. These results showed that social and emotional loneliness worsened sleep quality with anxiety and depression. On the contrary, emotional loneliness had a significant and direct effect on sleep quality but not on social loneliness. This study shows that psychological factors affect subjective sleep quality during self-restraint. Psychological factors, such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression should be considered when maintaining good sleep quality under self-restraint.","Furutani, Guo, Hall, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1080/21642850.2022.2112583","20220822","Sleep; anxiety; depression; loneliness; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36413,""
"COVID-19 diagnosis using deep learning neural networks applied to CT images","COVID-19, a deadly and highly contagious virus, caused the deaths of millions of individuals around the world. Early detection of the virus can reduce the virus transmission and fatality rate. Many deep learning (DL) based COVID-19 detection methods have been proposed, but most are trained on either small, incomplete, noisy, or imbalanced datasets. Many are also trained on a small number of COVID-19 samples. This study tackles these concerns by introducing DL-based solutions for COVID-19 diagnosis using computerized tomography (CT) images and 12 cutting-edge DL pre-trained models with acceptable Top-1 accuracy. All the models are trained on 9,000 COVID-19 samples and 5,000 normal images, which is higher than the COVID-19 images used in most studies. In addition, while most of the research used X-ray images for training, this study used CT images. CT scans capture blood arteries, bones, and soft tissues more effectively than X-Ray. The proposed techniques were evaluated, and the results show that NASNetLarge produced the best classification accuracy, followed by InceptionResNetV2 and DenseNet169. The three models achieved an accuracy of 99.86, 99.79, and 99.71%, respectively. Moreover, DenseNet121 and VGG16 achieved the best sensitivity, while InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2 achieved the best specificity. DenseNet121 and VGG16 attained a sensitivity of 99.94%, while InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2 achieved a specificity of 100%. The models are compared to those designed in three existing studies, and they produce better results. The results show that deep neural networks have the potential for computer-assisted COVID-19 diagnosis. We hope this study will be valuable in improving the decisions and accuracy of medical practitioners when diagnosing COVID-19. This study will assist future researchers in minimizing the repetition of analysis and identifying the ideal network for their tasks.","Akinyelu, Blignaut","https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2022.919672","20220822","COVID-19 diagnosis; CT images; convolutional neural network; deep learning networks; pre-trained models","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36414,""

"Associations between pre-COVID-19 physical activity profiles and mental wellbeing and quality of life during COVID-19 lockdown among adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has been detrimental to the physical and mental health and wellbeing of people across the globe. Regular physical activity has consistently demonstrated an array of health benefits, but the impact of regular physical activity habits pre-pandemic on health and wellbeing during the pandemic is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify distinct pre-COVID-19 lockdown physical activity profiles [i.e., walking, leisure-time moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), domestic MVPA and muscle strengthening exercise] and assess whether these profiles were associated with mental wellbeing and quality of life during COVID-19 lockdown.

Latent profile analysis identified five distinct profiles that differed in terms of levels of walking, leisure-time MVPA, domestic MVPA and muscle strengthening exercise. Based on the observed pre-COVID-19 lockdown profiles, it appears that high levels of MVPA and muscle strengthening exercise may serve as a protective factor against the potential negative impact of a global pandemic lockdown on mental wellbeing and quality of life.","Dadswell, Bourke, Maple, Craike","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03413-3","20220822","COVID-19; Latent profile analysis; Mental health; Mental wellbeing; Physical activity; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36417,""

The frequency of symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, and fear was assessed using the Bangla versions of the GHQ-12, PHQ-2, GAD-2, PSS-4, PC-PTSD-5, ISI, and FCV-19S scales, respectively. A total of 1,527 Bangladeshi teachers completed the questionnaire, with 678 (44.4%) being vaccinated and 849 (55.6%) being unvaccinated. Compared with unvaccinated teachers, vaccinated teachers had a statistically significant lower prevalence of psychological distress (35.8 vs. 42.9%), depression (37.6 vs. 46.4%), anxiety (31.9 vs. 45.1%), stress (18.3 vs. 32.0%), PTSD (33.0 vs. 43.8%), insomnia (25.2 vs. 36.9%), and fear symptoms (23.3 vs. 29.6%). Among vaccinated teachers, participants with master's or lower degree levels had significantly higher symptoms of depression, stress, and fear than other education levels. Respondents with children had a significantly higher risk of depression, anxiety, stress, and fear symptoms than those who did not have children. Participants who lost family members, friends, or colleagues due to the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly higher chance of experiencing symptoms of anxiety, PTSD, and fear than those who did not. On the other hand, unvaccinated male teachers were significantly associated with a higher risk of all mental health outcomes except psychological distress and PTSD symptoms compared to female teachers. Participants who were smokers had a significantly higher chance of anxiety, stress, and fear symptoms than non-smokers. Compared to participants with strong social support, those with poor social support had a higher risk of all mental health outcomes except PTSD symptoms. This study suggests emphasizing the vaccinated to unvaccinated teachers as soon as possible to control the infection and improve mental health outcomes. Vulnerable teachers also required special attention, health-related education, and psychological support.","Alam, Islam, Hossain, Hossain, Akhter, Haider, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.896419","20220822","Bangladesh; COVID-19; immunization; mental health outcomes; refusal; teachers; uptake","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36421,""
"Factors influencing hospital anxiety and depression among emergency department nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-center cross-sectional study","The emergency department (ED) is a highly stressful environment, which exposes nurses to infection. ED nurses handle life-threatening conditions, endure long working hours, and deal with anxious patients and their families. This study aimed to examine factors, which may influence anxiety and depression levels among ED nurses during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A cross-sectional design was used with 251 participants from six hospitals in Saudi Arabia (mean age = 32.7 Ã‚Â± 6.59, range = 21-54 years, 70.5% females). Data were collected using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM). Based on the HADS scores, 29.1 and 25.5% of ED nurses were identified as doubtful cases for depression and anxiety, respectively. Additionally, 34.7 and 43.3% of ED nurses were identified as definite cases for depression and anxiety, respectively. Higher anxiety levels were observed among female nurses, nurses with lower physical activity levels, and nurses who worked in urban areas. Low physical activity levels and more than 6 years of work experience correlated with a higher level of depression. None of the hypothesized paths in the anxiety and depression models were significant, except for two observed variables-namely, work location and physical exercise in the anxiety model and physical exercise in the depression model. Emergency department nurses expressed high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may negatively affect their performance and reduce care quality. Therefore, health care leaders should implement specialized mental health education programs focused on nursing occupational safety and support to improve ED nurses' psychological well-being. Specific attention should be paid to ED female nurses who work in urban areas, especially those with more than 6 years of experience.","Alzahrani, Almarwani, Asiri, Alharbi, Alhowaymel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.912157","20220822","COVID-19; female nurses; healthcare; mental health; psychology; urban area","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36422,""
"Seeking bridge symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance among the elderly during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic-A network approach","Besides physical changes, elderly adults are prone to have mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and the pandemic of COVID-19 worsened the situation. However, internal relationships and co-occurrence of psychopathologies were scarcely examined. Therefore, in the current study, through network analysis, we inspected relationships among symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance and identified key symptoms that espoused the disease. We asked 1,302 elderly adults to fill in Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (depressive symptoms), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (anxiety symptoms), and the Youth Self-rating Insomnia Scale (sleep disturbance) and then constructed three networks for elderly adults, male elderly, and female elderly. <i>Via</i> network analysis, we accomplished four goals. First, we identified symptom with the highest centrality (i.e., strength) index for each network; then, we found the strongest correlation (i.e., edges) in each network; thirdly, we confirmed specific nodes that could bridge anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance; the last was to compare networks based on genders. Network stability and accuracy tests were performed. Networks of elderly adults, male elderly, and female elderly were stable, accurate, and intelligible. Among all networks, ""Nervousness""- ""Excessive worry"" (GAD-1- GAD-2) had the strongest correlation, and ""Nervousness"" (GAD-1) had the highest strength and bridge strength value. When we made a comparison between female elderly's and male elderly's networks, except for the significant difference in the mean value of ""Difficulty initiating sleep"" (YSIS-3), the findings showed that the two networks were similar. Network stability and accuracy proved to be reliable. In networks of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, anxiety played a conspicuous role in comorbidity, which could be a target for practical intervention and prevention.","Zhang, Tao, Hou, Niu, Ma, Zheng, Wang, Zhang, Lv, Li, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.919251","20220822","anxiety; depression; elderly; network; sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36423,""
"Depression and anxiety among children and adolescents pre and post COVID-19: A comparative meta-analysis","Published studies in comparing pre and post the COVID-19 pandemic depression and anxiety levels among children and adolescents yielded incongruent results. Therefore, there is a necessity to perform a timely meta-analysis to synthesize existing evidence. A total of 10 digital databases (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, ScienceDirect, CNKI, WanFang, CQVIP) were fully searched for eligible studies published before November 6, 2021. Based on quality assessment results, relevant data were extracted for eligible studies of higher quality. We combined standardized mean difference (SMD) or prevalence ratio (RR) for anxiety and depression pre and post the COVID-19 pandemic by using random-effects models. Sensitivity analysis was further performed to evaluate heterogeneity of included studies. 14,508 articles were preliminarily identified, and after stepwise screening process, 8 articles were included eventually. The results showed that the SMD for post COVID-19 anxiety score measured by GAD-7 was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.17), an significant increase compared with pre COVID-19 period; the SMDs and 95% CIs for post COVID-18 depression scores measured by PHQ-9, PHQ-8, and MFQ were 0.17 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.24), 0.23 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.38), and 0.11 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.17), respectively, also significantly increased compared with pre COVID-19 period. The RR for depression was 2.54 (95% CI: 2.48, 2.60) in post COVID-19 period when compared with pre-pandemic. Children and adolescents reported deteriorated anxiety and depression levels after the COVID-19 pandemic. More attention should be paid to this vulnerable group.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Psychological Well-Being of Surgeons in Pakistan: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study","Introduction The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic left a profound and pervasive impact on the healthcare infrastructure on a global scale. Since its onset, the pattern of reported cases and its associated mortality had shown variability with intermittent peaks causing a significant effect on the psychological well-being of the surgeons of Pakistan. The aimÃ‚Â of this study was to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being of surgeons in Pakistan. Methods ThisÃ‚Â multicenter cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the psychological well-being of surgeons in Pakistan. The validated Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) tool was circulated electronically via Google Forms (Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) in the practicing surgical fraternity across all five regions of Pakistan, i.e., Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Results This study showed that the female gender, having fewer years of working experience, non-satisfaction with the available personal protective equipment (PPE), and working in the public sector were the factors affecting the psychological well-being of surgeons during the pandemic. Conclusion Considering the continuous rise inÃ‚Â new cases during the ongoing pandemic, the mental health of surgeons working in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)Ã‚Â such as Pakistan has been significantly affected. There is an undeniable need to pay close attention to their psychological well-being.

"Student and School Characteristics Associated With COVID-19-Related Learning Decline Among Middle and High School Students in K-12 Schools","COVID-19-disrupted schools, including shifts to virtual learning which may have impacted academic progress. This study assessed characteristics associated with changes in academic grades (before and during the pandemic) for different learning modalities for US students ages 13-19. Students (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2152) completed a web survey on school-related experiences during the 2020-2021 school year. County social vulnerability and SARS-CoV-2 transmission data were merged with survey data. Multivariable logistic regression analysis for grade change was conducted with student and school characteristics for each learning modality, controlling for community characteristics. Greater proportions of remote/virtual (34.4%) and hybrid (30.1%) learning students reported grade decline compared to in-person students (19.9%). Among in-person students, odds of reporting same/improved grades were 65% lower among non-Hispanic black students and 66% lower among non-Hispanic students from other races, compared to non-Hispanic white students. Among hybrid students, odds of reporting same/improved grades for students reporting anxiety were 47% lower than students without anxiety, and odds of reporting same/improved grades among students reporting substance use were 40% lower than students not reporting substance use. Among remote/virtual students, odds of reporting same/improved grades among students with depression were 62% lower than odds of students not reporting depression symptoms. Remote/virtual students who received school-provided educational services also had 1.55 times the odds of reporting same/improved grades, compared to remote/virtual students not receiving these services.

"Telehealth service delivery in an Australian regional mental health service during COVID-19: a mixed methods analysis","COVID-19 required mental health services to quickly switch from face-to-face service delivery to telehealth (telephone and videoconferencing). This evaluation explored implementation of a telehealth mental health response in a regional public mental health provider. A mixed methods approach, combining service use data, brief satisfaction surveys, and qualitative interviews/focus groups was undertaken. Number and types of contacts from de-identified mental health service data were compared between April-May 2020 and April-May 2019. Mental health consumers and providers completed brief online satisfaction surveys after videoconferencing sessions. Attitudes and perspectives on the implementation of telehealth were further explored by applying a descriptive qualitative framework to the analysis of interview and focus group data supplied by consumers and providers. Template thematic analysis was used to elucidate key themes relating to the barriers and enablers of telehealth uptake and future implementation recommendations. Total contacts decreased by 13% from 2019 to 2020. Face-to-face contacts decreased from 55% of total in 2019 to 24% in 2020. In 2019, 45% of contacts were by telephone, increasing to 70% in 2020. Only four videoconferencing contacts were made in 2019; increasing to 886 in 2020. Consumer surveys (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26) rated videoconferencing as good or excellent for technical quality (92%), overall experience (86%), and satisfaction with personal comfort (82%). Provider surveys (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°88) rated technical quality as good or excellent (68%) and 86% could achieve assessment/treatment goals with videoconferencing. Provider focus groups/interviews (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32) identified that videoconferencing was well-suited to some clinical tasks. Consumers interviewed (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6) endorsed the ongoing availability of telehealth within a blended approach to service delivery. Both groups reflected on videoconferencing limitations due to infrastructure (laptops, phones, internet access), cumbersome platform and privacy concerns, with many reverting to telephone use. While videoconferencing increased, technical and other issues led to telephone being the preferred contact method. Satisfaction surveys indicated improvement opportunities in videoconferencing. Investment in user-friendly platforms, telehealth infrastructure and organisational guidelines are needed for successful integration of videoconferencing in public mental health systems.","Chatterton, Marangu, Clancy, Mackay, Gu, Moylan, Langbein, O'Shea","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-022-00553-8","20220822","COVID-19; Mental health systems; Mixed methods; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36430,""
"Assessing the mental effects of COVID-19-related work on depression among community health workers in Vietnam","Community health workers (CHWs) involved in the COVID-19 response might be at increased risk of developing depression, though evidence is scarce. We investigated effects of COVID-19-related work on changes in depression levels among CHWs in Vietnam and identified sub-groups among CHWs who are at particular risk of developing severe depression. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 979 CHWs who were involved in the COVID-19 response in Vietnam, in particular during the 2021 Tet holiday outbreak between January and March 2021. Respondents were asked to report depression symptoms at two-time points, before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (average June to December 2019) and during the 2021 Tet holiday outbreak using the PHQ-9 mental health questionnaire. We estimated depression levels at both time points and developed univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to explore the association between deterioration to high depression levels and selected risk factors. Median depression levels among CHWs in Vietnam doubled from 3 (IQRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2-7) before COVID-19 to 6 (IQRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3-9) on the PHQ-9 scale during the Tet holiday outbreak. The proportion with normal/minimal levels decreased from 77.1% (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°74.4-79.7) to 50.9% (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°47.7-54) (p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), while the proportion of CHWs with moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression levels increased 4.3, 4.5, and five-fold, respectively. Less sleep and poor sleep quality, working in unfavorable work environments, and being involved in contact tracing and the organization of quarantine for suspected cases were associated with an increased risk of deterioration to high depression levels. We found a substantial increase in overall depression levels among CHWs in Vietnam due to their COVID-19 related work and a particularly worrisome rise in CHWs suffering from severe depression. CHWs are an indispensable yet often overlooked cadre of work in many low- and middle-income countries and shoulder a heavy psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted psychological support for CHWs is needed to improve their mental health and to ensure the sustainability of community-based health interventions during COVID-19 and future epidemics.","Hoang, Van Hoang, Quach, Nguyen, Duong, Pham, Vogt","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-022-00760-x","20220822","COVID-19; Community health workers; Depression; Vietnam","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36431,""

The objective of this study was to gather information on older cancer survivors' perspectives and use of telehealth their cancer survivorship care in the United States. Potential participants were recruited through ResearchMatchÃ‚Â® from December 2020-January 2021. Online semi-structured interviews were conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the participants' demographic and health characteristics. Content analysis were conducted by two independent coders for identification of common themes. Coding agreement was reached through consensus, and count comparisons of participant responses were made. The majority of respondents (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 21; mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 73.5Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4.9) were female (57%), White (90%), and had a variety of cancer diagnoses. Participants reported using a variety of technology devices and telehealth products. Older cancer survivors (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 10) endorsed telehealth video use for physical health concerns and basic check-ups, but some (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4) preferred in-person visits for major concerns and sensitive issues (e.g., mental health). Half of participants reported mobile health app use; however, ten participants did not use these apps as they felt the technology was not useful. Barriers to health technology use included missing face-to-face connections with providers, lack of familiarity with the technology, and perceived lack of utility and personalized telehealth platforms. Lastly, video-based conferencing and social media site use among seventeen participants was reported for social interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that older cancer survivors utilize online platforms for their general health; however, they prefer in-person visits for serious issues and value personalization with telehealth. Despite from a highly educated sample of ResearchMatchÃ‚Â® participants, these results can be used to inform clinicians and researchers about the appropriateness and provision of telehealth-based supportive care among older cancer survivors.","Arthur, Pisegna, Oliveri, Aker, Krok-Schoen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2022.08.004","20220819","Older adults; Supportive care; Telehealth; cancer survivorship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36433,""
"Can dogs serve as stress mediators to decrease salivary cortisol levels in a population of liberal arts college undergraduate students?","The steroid hormone cortisol can be used to measure physiological stress in humans. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis synthesizes cortisol, and a negative feedback cycle regulates cortisol depending on an individual's stress level and/or circadian rhythm. Chronic stress of college undergraduate students is associated with various adverse health effects, including anxiety and depression. Reports suggest that stress levels have risen dramatically in recent years, particularly among university students dealing with intense academic loads in addition to COVID-19 pandemic-related uncertainty. The increasing rate of mental illness on college campuses necessitates the study of mediators potentially capable of lowering stress, and thus cortisol levels. Research on mediation techniques and coping mechanisms have gained traction to address the concerning levels of stress, including the employment of human-animal interaction sessions on college campuses. In this study, human-canine interaction as a stress mediation strategy for undergraduate students was investigated. We measured salivary cortisol levels in 73 college undergraduate students during a 60-min interaction period with a dog to determine whether human-canine interactions are effective in lowering cortisol levels and potentially reducing chronic stress typical of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that a human-canine interaction for 60Ã‚Â min is an effective method for significantly reducing salivary cortisol and stress levels among undergraduate college students. These findings support the expansion of animal visitation programs on college campuses to help students manage stress.","Jimenez, Calderaro, Clark, Elacqua, Hazen, Lam, Leightheiser","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.explore.2022.08.007","20220821","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36434,""
"Child and Adolescent Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of the Three-Wave Longitudinal COPSY Study","The German population-based longitudinal COVID-19 andPsychological Health study monitors changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies vulnerable groups. A nationwide, population-based survey was conducted in May 2020 to June 2020 (WaveÃ‚Â 1), December 2020 to January 2021 (Wave 2), and September 2021 to October 2021 (Wave 3). In total, nÃ‚Â = 2,097 children and adolescents aged 7-17Ã‚Â years were investigated using measures to assess HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-10), mental health problems (SDQ), anxiety (SCARED), depressive symptoms(PHQ-2), and psychosomatic complaints(HBSC-SCL). The prevalence of low HRQoL increased from 15% prepandemic to 40% and 48% in Waves 1 and 2 and improved slightly to 35% in Wave 3 (all differences significant). Similarly, overall mental health problems increased from 18% prepandemic to 29% in Wave 1 and 31% in Wave 2 to 28% in Wave 3 (all differences significant, except Wave 3 vs. 2), anxiety increased from 15% prepandemic to 24% and 30% in Waves 1 and 2 and was still 27% in Wave 3. Depressive symptoms increased from 10% prepandemic to 11% and 15% in Waves 1 and 2 and were 11% in Wave 3. A group with low parental education, restricted living conditions, migration background, and parental mental health problems was at significantly increased risk of HRQoL and mental health impairments. The prevalence of low HRQoL, mental health problems, and anxiety has been elevated throughout the pandemic. Thus, mental health promotion, prevention, and intervention strategies need to be implemented to support adolescents-particularly those at risk.","Ravens-Sieberer, Erhart, Devine, Gilbert, Reiss, Barkmann, Siegel, Simon, Hurrelmann, Schlack, HÃƒÂ¶lling, Wieler, Kaman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.06.022","20220821","Adolescents; Anxiety; Depression; Health-related quality of life; Longitudinal study; Mental health; SARS-COV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36435,""
"The radiography students' perspective of the impact of COVID-19 on education and training internationally: a across sectional survey of the UK Devolved Nations (UKDN) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)","The overnight change in hospital practice and service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic raises the question whether undergraduate radiography students received an adequate clinical experience. Many students had their clinical placements cancelled, deferred or replaced with simulated learning. As a way of dealing with the pandemic some hospitals were dedicated to COVID-19 patients only resulting in many elective procedures being cancelled. Many patients also chose to stay away from the hospital out of fear of infection or the desire to reduce the burden on staff. This resulted in a limited range of examinations and clinical experience for those students who were able to complete their clinical placement. This study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the education and training of radiography students internationally in the United Kingdom Devolved Nations (UKDN) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to determine any possible impact on their future careers. Ethical permission was sought and granted from the Research Ethics Committees (ID: 21-04-12-02 and ID:21/0032). An online survey was developed using Google Forms and link was shared with students via email. 262 students participated in the study [UAE (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 60, 23%) and UKDN (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 202, 77%)]. 72% stated that their clinical skills have improved and 82% were confident in the choice of radiography as a career. Participants from UAE displayed a higher tendency towards anxiety (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009). Students who were on clinical placements during the COVID-19 pandemic and worked with COVID-19 positive patients displayed less ongoing concern relating to COVID-19 (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004). 78% of the participants did not require wellbeing advice or request any type of wellbeing support from the higher education institutions (HEIs). Nevertheless, the study found that wellbeing of students was found to be negatively affected during the pandemic. Completing clinical placement during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed the continuation of education as students were allowed to improve their skills, confidence and resilience in coping with uncertainties and challenges. Undergraduate students should not be excluded from the clinical department during subsequent waves of COVID-19 or future pandemics to ensure continued workforce planning is possible. HEIs should find solutions to compensate students for the loss of practical experience and skills due to the decreased number of patients in some areas of radiography practice. Providing academic and career counselling can assist students achieve their professional objectives and decrease the risk of attrition and problems upon qualification.","Elshami, Abuzaid, McConnell, Stewart, Floyd, Hughes, McClintick, Eckloff, Leishman, McFadden","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2022.07.009","20220821","COVID-19; Mental health/wellbeing; Radiography; Student education; Student perspective; Training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36436,""
"An interrupted time series analysis of gambling behavior based on gambling operator revenue-based taxation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden","The impact of COVID-19 on gambling behavior and the gambling industry itself has been widely speculated. Prior studies have shown how boredom, social isolation, poor mental health, and financial hardships, all of which have been associated with COVID-19, can aggravate problem gambling behaviors in patients with gambling disorders while also luring newcomers. Few studies have used methods other than self-report to assess longitudinal behavioral changes in gambling behavior before versus during the pandemic. The present study addresses this gap by using an interrupted time series approach on data obtained from the Swedish Gambling Authority measuring taxation on gambling vendors' revenue between January 2019 and November 2021. March, June, and October 2020 were chosen as interruption points as they correspond to the pandemic's commencement, the return of elite sports, and the second wave of cases in Sweden, respectively. We hypothesized that the pandemic would be associated with both temporary changes for select gambling types and long-term increases in online gambling. Results revealed the pandemic's onset was associated with transient effects at each point of interruption, as well as long-term upward trends in total gambling and commercial online gambling, excluding horse betting and the state-owned operator for online casinos and betting. The present study's findings, although consistent with the theory that gambling activity could increase during the pandemic, contradict previous studies that found no changes or a decrease from pre-COVID-19 levels. Findings indicate that the pandemic and Sweden's reaction to it were associated with increased use of some gambling products.","Andersson, Balem, HÃƒÂ¥kansson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.07.003","20220821","Behavioral addiction; COVID-19; Gambling disorder; Interrupted time series analysis; Problem gambling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36437,""
"The relationships between knowledge levels, health-protective practices, and anxiety in nurses in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic","It is important to determine nurses' levels of knowledge, health-protective practices for work and social life, and mental health states at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to combat the pandemic and minimize further problems. To determine the relationships between knowledge levels, health-protective practices, and anxiety among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was carried out with the online participation of 605 nurses in Turkey. The researchers prepared a questionnaire form to evaluate the participants' knowledge of COVID-19 and their awareness and health-protective behaviours in work and social life. The mental health statuses of the participants were assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. Most of the participants (87.8%) had high levels of knowledge of COVID-19, while 28.8% had severe levels of anxiety disorder. The use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants (88.2%) and the use of N95 or N99 masks (88.5%) were the least frequently practiced protective behaviours at work, while in social life, a healthy and balanced diet (61.6%), social distancing (72.8%), and paying attention to one's sleep pattern (77.3%) were the least frequently practiced protective behaviours. Older age (41-50 years), higher education (master's degree) and having a work experience of 10 years or more were determined to increase the knowledge levels of the participants about COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001). Anxiety levels were higher in those with a history of mental illness (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001). Determining the knowledge levels, health-protective practices, and anxiety levels of nurses who are struggling in the frontlines in the field of health during the pandemic period can make a great contribution to the management of different current epidemics and pandemics and future ones by showing the areas in which nurses need to be empowered.","Cevik, Kasapoglu","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-220194","20220821","COVID-19; COVID-19 knowledge level; Healthcare worker; nurses; pandemic; personal protective practices; work life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36438,""
"A study on the changes in life habits, mental health, and sleep quality of college students due to COVID-19","In early 2020, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated changes in social behavior to prevent its spread, including holding online classes, implementing social distancing, and allowing employees to telecommute. However, these changes have had a negative impact on people's sleep patterns and mental health, particularly for college students. This study investigated the relationship between mental health and sleep quality according to the changes in lifestyle of college students in the periods before and after COVID-19. The study subjects were 164 college students from Korea who had both face-to-face and non-face-to-face college experiences before and after COVID-19. The experiment was conducted using a Google survey, and the participants were recruited from the college community. The general features and lifestyle habits for the individuals were assessed using the AUDIT-K, Delphi method, KGHQ (General Mental Health Scale), and PSQI-K (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index). The KGHQ and PSQI scores increased with the spread of COVID-19, which means that the mental health and sleep quality of college students deteriorated. 11 categories of variables were further investigated to evaluate changes in lifestyle, and the results indicate significant changes in the number of private meetings per week, monthly drinking, outdoor activity time, electronic device usage time, weekly food delivery, weekly late-night snacks, daily snacks, and daily coffee intake and no significant changes in exercise, smoking, and fast food intake. COVID-19 caused many changes in the lifestyle of college students, which adversely affected mental health and sleep.","Lee, Kim, Moon, Jung, Jo, Kim, Ryu, Bahn","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-220112","20220821","Coronavirus; Korea; lifestyle habits; mental health; sleep quality; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36439,""
"People with visual impairment in outward-facing work -developing a tool to measure employer attitudes","Over the years, persons with disabilities have suffered unjustifiably due to a low employment rate, largely the result of unsupportive and negative attitude from employers. Such attitudes are exacerbated during periods of economic stress, with a case par excellence being the current COVID-19 pandemic. Prior studies have addressed common concerns of employers within the workplace. However, the dimensions of these concerns extend beyond the internal working environment, to the outward-facing work environment, involving interactions with customers and suppliers. These concerns have not, thus far, been properly addressed. To develop the Service from People With Visual Impairment (SPVI) psychometric measure, a 6-item employers' attitude assessment tool. This study is based on 1,036 questionnaires collected using Online Panel Data (OPD), from managers who have hiring authority. We performed Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for discriminant and convergent validity. Finally, we present an empirical model comprising a stable single factor and establish predictive validity using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). CFA showed good fit to the observed data; CMIN/DFÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 1.94, pÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05, CFIÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 1, TLIÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.99, NFIÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 1, RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.03.

The results suggest that the instrument could become a pragmatic tool to assess employer attitudes to employ people with visual impairment or blindness due to external work environment concerns. The tool is relevant to a wide range of circumstances, including economic downturns.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the clinical experience and training of undergraduate Student radiographers internationally: The clinical tutors' perspective","The impact on the clinical training and education of healthcare students by COVID-19 has been documented. However, the thoughts and experiences of clinical tutors (CTs) about radiography students attending for clinical training and education during this now elongated period beyond first recognition of the virus has not been explored. This paper will discuss data collected from CTs in the UK Devolved Nations (UKDN) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who were compared because of their similarities in delivery based on individual 'rules of engagement' devised by their various health departments. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical tutors' thoughts and experiences of supervising radiography students attending clinical placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The UK Devolved Nations (UKDN) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were selected for comparison on an international level as they are geographically distinct with a comparable population and education accredited/acknowledged by the Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR). Data was collected data from CTs across the UKDN and the UAE. The study used an online questionnaire (Google Forms) with closed questions in four themes including: students' experiences, impact on students' clinical placement, attitude of the clinical staff and the potential effects of COVID-19 on future graduates' skills and competencies. Further data was gathered on the experience of CTs mentoring students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from 59 CTs (81%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 48) from UKDN and (19%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11) UAE. Twenty-seven (46%) respondents reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on clinical practical experience. However, 32 (54%) identified that COVID-19 had no impact on student supervision/feedback or on clinical achievements. Eleven (19%) respondents thought that students should not have been on clinical placement during the pandemic but a further 51% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30) were happy with the students on placement and expressed willingness to delegate work to students. Interestingly, 58% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 34) of CTs suggested that future graduates may need a longer preceptorship after they graduate due to receiving decreased clinical experience during the pandemic. Overall, 78% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 46) of respondents thought that students improved their clinical confidence by working directly with COVID-19 positive patients. The current study has identified conflicting opinions across CTs in different clinical departments. Whilst some felt that students should not be in the hospital during the pandemic, others reported that working directly with COVID-19 patients had a positive impact on students as it improved their clinical confidence. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, CTs were able to provide direct clinical supervision and feedback to students on clinical placement throughout the pandemic. Nevertheless, future graduates may need a longer preceptorship period due to decreased clinical experience during the pandemic. Clinical placements should continue during subsequent COVID-19 waves of infection or future pandemics to ensure development of skills in resilience and adaptability. Underdeveloped skills due to a decreased range of examinations can be rectified when any wave of the infection subsides by providing tailored training based on individual student's needs.","Elshami, Abuzaid, McConnell, Floyd, Hughes, Stewart, McFadden","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2022.07.012","20220820","COVID-19; Clinical tutor; Healthcare worker; Mental health/Wellbeing; Radiography; Student education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36441,""
"Depression, anxiety, and stress among Iranian nurses in COVID-19 care wards","Nurses are at the frontline of care provision to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The high communicability of COVID-19, high levels of stress associated with the disease, and challenges of care provision to afflicted patients faced nurses in Iran with problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress. The aim of the study was to assess depression, anxiety, and stress among Iranian nurses who provided care to patients with COVID-19. This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study was conducted in 2020-2021. Participants were 468 nurses purposively selected from university hospitals in Iran. They completed two online instruments, namely a demographic questionnaire and the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software (v. 23.0). Most participants were female (75.9%) and married (73.4%) and held bachelor's degree (88%). The means of participants' age and work experience were 33.59Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.40Ã‚Â years and 10.26Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.61Ã‚Â years, respectively.

"Sheds for life: health and wellbeing outcomes of a tailored community-based health promotion initiative for men's sheds in Ireland","Gender is increasingly recognised as a critical factor in designing community-based health promotion programmes. Men's Sheds ('Sheds') are community-based informal environments that represent a safe space in which to engage cohorts of hard-to-reach (HTR) men in health promotion. Sheds for Life (SFL), the first structured health promotion initiative evaluated globally in Sheds, is a 10-week initiative co-designed with Shed Members (Shedders) and delivered directly in the Shed setting in Ireland. This research describes the health and wellbeing outcomes experienced by SFL participants. Purposive sampling was used to recruit a diverse representation of Shedders (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°421) participating in SFL alongside a wait list control (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°86). Questionnaires assessing constructs of health and wellbeing were administered one-to-one in Sheds at baseline, 3, 6 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Descriptive data for health outcomes were generated for each time point and assessed for significant changes using inferential testing, while considering COVID-19 impact. Outcomes related to subjective wellbeing, mental wellbeing, physical activity, social capital and healthy eating significantly increased post SFL (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Mental wellbeing scores (SWEMWBS) post SFL remained significantly higher than baseline despite COVID-19 impact (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Binary logistic regression indicated that the odds of a meaningful SWEMWBS change was significantly higher for shedders that had lower SWEMWBS (OR 0.804), less loneliness (OR 0.638) and lived alone (OR 0.456) at baseline. Shedders with lower SWEMBWS had higher odds of experiencing positive changes in life satisfaction (OR 0.911) and trust (OR 0.928), while Shedders who lived alone had also higher odds of experience positive changes in healthy eating (OR 0.481). Finally, inactive Shedders at baseline had higher odds of experiencing increased levels of physical activity (OR 0.582). Findings suggest that the inclusive, community-based SFL model is effective in engaging Shedders and facilitating positive and sustained changes in health and wellbeing outcomes. Using gender-specific approaches in the informal and safe environment of the Shed are effective in engaging men in structured health and wellbeing initiatives, particularly those who may be more vulnerable, isolated or lonely.

"Neurological and psychiatric risk trajectories after SARS-CoV-2 infection: an analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies including 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†284Ã¢â‚¬Ë†437 patients","COVID-19 is associated with increased risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae in the weeks and months thereafter. How long these risks remain, whether they affect children and adults similarly, and whether SARS-CoV-2 variants differ in their risk profiles remains unclear. In this analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies, we extracted data from the TriNetX electronic health records network, an international network of de-identified data from health-care records of approximately 89 million patients collected from hospital, primary care, and specialist providers (mostly from the USA, but also from Australia, the UK, Spain, Bulgaria, India, Malaysia, and Taiwan). A cohort of patients of any age with COVID-19 diagnosed between Jan 20, 2020, and April 13, 2022, was identified and propensity-score matched (1:1) to a contemporaneous cohort of patients with any other respiratory infection. Matching was done on the basis of demographic factors, risk factors for COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 illness, and vaccination status. Analyses were stratified by age group (age &lt;18 years [children], 18-64 years [adults], and Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years [older adults]) and date of diagnosis. We assessed the risks of 14 neurological and psychiatric diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared these risks with the matched comparator cohort. The 2-year risk trajectories were represented by time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) and summarised using the 6-month constant HRs (representing the risks in the earlier phase of follow-up, which have not yet been well characterised in children), the risk horizon for each outcome (ie, the time at which the HR returns to 1), and the time to equal incidence in the two cohorts. We also estimated how many people died after a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis during follow-up in each age group. Finally, we compared matched cohorts of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 directly before and after the emergence of the alpha (B.1.1.7), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants. We identified 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†487Ã¢â‚¬Ë†712 patients with a recorded diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†284Ã¢â‚¬Ë†437 (185Ã¢â‚¬Ë†748 children, 856Ã¢â‚¬Ë†588 adults, and 242Ã¢â‚¬Ë†101 older adults; overall mean age 42Ã‚Â·5 years [SD 21Ã‚Â·9]; 741Ã¢â‚¬Ë†806 [57Ã‚Â·8%] were female and 542Ã¢â‚¬Ë†192 [42Ã‚Â·2%] were male) were adequately matched with an equal number of patients with another respiratory infection. The risk trajectories of outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the whole cohort differed substantially. While most outcomes had HRs significantly greater than 1 after 6 months (with the exception of encephalitis; Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorder; and parkinsonism), their risk horizons and time to equal incidence varied greatly. Risks of the common psychiatric disorders returned to baseline after 1-2 months (mood disorders at 43 days, anxiety disorders at 58 days) and subsequently reached an equal overall incidence to the matched comparison group (mood disorders at 457 days, anxiety disorders at 417 days). By contrast, risks of cognitive deficit (known as brain fog), dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures were still increased at the end of the 2-year follow-up period. Post-COVID-19 risk trajectories differed in children compared with adults: in the 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, children were not at an increased risk of mood (HR 1Ã‚Â·02 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·94-1Ã‚Â·10) or anxiety (1Ã‚Â·00 [0Ã‚Â·94-1Ã‚Â·06]) disorders, but did have an increased risk of cognitive deficit, insomnia, intracranial haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures (HRs ranging from 1Ã‚Â·20 [1Ã‚Â·09-1Ã‚Â·33] to 2Ã‚Â·16 [1Ã‚Â·46-3Ã‚Â·19]). Unlike adults, cognitive deficit in children had a finite risk horizon (75 days) and a finite time to equal incidence (491 days). A sizeable proportion of older adults who received a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis, in either cohort, subsequently died, especially those diagnosed with dementia or epilepsy or seizures. Risk profiles were similar just before versus just after the emergence of the alpha variant (n=47Ã¢â‚¬Ë†675 in each cohort). Just after (vs just before) the emergence of the delta variant (n=44Ã¢â‚¬Ë†835 in each cohort), increased risks of ischaemic stroke, epilepsy or seizures, cognitive deficit, insomnia, and anxiety disorders were observed, compounded by an increased death rate. With omicron (n=39Ã¢â‚¬Ë†845 in each cohort), there was a lower death rate than just before emergence of the variant, but the risks of neurological and psychiatric outcomes remained similar. This analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 showed that the increased incidence of mood and anxiety disorders was transient, with no overall excess of these diagnoses compared with other respiratory infections. In contrast, the increased risk of psychotic disorder, cognitive deficit, dementia, and epilepsy or seizures persisted throughout. The differing trajectories suggest a different pathogenesis for these outcomes. Children have a more benign overall profile of psychiatric risk than do adults and older adults, but their sustained higher risk of some diagnoses is of concern. The fact that neurological and psychiatric outcomes were similar during the delta and omicron waves indicates that the burden on the health-care system might continue even with variants that are less severe in other respects. Our findings are relevant to understanding individual-level and population-level risks of neurological and psychiatric disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection and can help inform our responses to them.

"Trends and prevalence of suicide 2017-2021 and its association with COVID-19: Interrupted time series analysis of a national sample of college students in the United States","Suicide is among the leading causes of death for college students. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on trends in suicidal thoughts and behaviors among college students, and whether suicidal thoughts and behaviors were associated with COVID-19 infection and psychosocial factors. We analyzed 2017-2021 data from 4 waves of Healthy Minds Study including a random sample of college students (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 354,473) from 286Ã‚Â U.S. institutions. We performed interrupted time series analysis to model the effect of the pandemic on trends in suicidal ideation (SI), plan (SP), and attempt (SA). At the peripandemic assessment, we utilized multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of SI, SP, and SA with COVID-19 infection and psychosocial factors. We observed significant decreases in SI, SP, and SA among college students from 2017 to 2021. The pandemic was significantly associated with a 1.33 percentage points reduction in SI and a 0.85 percentage points reduction in SP but was not associated with a significant reduction in SA. Adjusted associations of SI, SP, and SA with risk factors showed the significant odds ratio (OR) for suspected COVID-19 infection (SI: 1.33, SP: 1.22, SA: 1.32), severe depression (SI: 6.39, SP: 6.63, SA: 5.63), severe anxiety (SI: 3.66, SP: 3.62, SA: 3.60), COVID-19-related financial stress (SI: 1.35, SP: 1.34, SA: 1.48), food insecurity (SI: 2.12, SP: 2.13, SA: 2.79), and academic impairment (SI: 2.07, SP: 2.05, SA: 2.14) but not for test-confirmed COVID-19.

"Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Adolescence: The Role of Pre-Existing Vulnerabilities and COVID-19-Related Stress","For many adolescents, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a uniquely challenging period, and concerns have been raised about whether COVID-19-related stress may increase the risk for self-injurious behaviors among adolescents. This study examined the impact of pre-existing vulnerabilities on the occurrence and frequency of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) through COVID-19-related stress, and whether the impact of COVID-19-related stress on NSSI was buffered by the perceived social support during the pandemic. Participants were 1061 adolescents (52.40% females; M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.49 years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.76) from a two-wave longitudinal study, which included assessments before the COVID-19 onset and one year later the declaration of the pandemic. Path analyses showed that adolescents with a prior history of NSSI, higher levels of internalizing symptoms, and poor regulatory emotional self-efficacy before the COVID-19 pandemic reported higher levels of COVID-19-related stress which in turn increased their risk to engage in NSSI. Besides, the findings did not support the role of social support as a moderator of the association between COVID-19 related stress and the occurrence/frequency of NSSI. These findings suggest that enhanced stress perception may serve as a key pathway for the continuation and development of NSSI among vulnerable adolescents facing adverse life events.","De Luca, Giletta, Nocentini, Menesini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-022-01669-3","20220820","Adolescence; COVID-19-related stress; Longitudinal study; Non-suicidal self-injury; Pre-existing vulnerabilities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36447,""
"Violent behavior and the COVID-19 lockdowns: a nationwide register-based study","The primary aim was to test the hypothesis that physical interpersonal violence is decreased during the lockdown period in comparison with comparable control periods. The secondary aims were to explore the effects of gender and alcohol consumption on the violence during the lockdown. Nationwide records of hospitalizations secondary to an assault were analyzed using quasipoisson regression. Assault rates in two lockdown periods, defined as a national emergency state, were compared to baseline data between 2017 and 2020, controlling for seasonal fluctuations and pandemic-related effects other than lockdown. To validate the findings on independent data, differences between lockdown and baseline in Police records of violent criminality between 2017 and 2021 were examined using one-way ANOVA. The rates of hospitalizations secondary to an assault decreased substantially during lockdowns (IRRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .43; <i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) and the duration of lockdown did not affect assault rates (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .07). The decrease in assault rates was more pronounced in males than females (IRRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .77; <i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05) and was weakened in patients with history of alcohol abuse (IRRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.83; <i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Violent crime rate decreased by 19% during the lockdowns compared to prepandemic baseline (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). We found that physical interpersonal violence decreased during the COVID-19 lockdown periods. The reduction is significantly greater in males. Emerging evidence suggests an increased risk of alcohol use and intoxication during the lockdowns. Violent crime rate decreased during the lockdown.","Pisl, Vevera, Holas, Volavka","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1092852922000797","20220822","COVID-19; aggression; alcohol; crime; lockdown; violence; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36448,""
"[Welche Behandlungsoptionen wurden von COVID-19-infizierten YogaÃƒÂ¼benden als hilfreich empfunden? Ergebnisse einer Querschnittsanalyse]","EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung: Die meisten COVID-19 Infizierten machen die Infektion im hÃƒÂ¤uslichen Umfeld durch und werden vermutliche MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen zur Symptomlinderung anwenden, die aus dem Bereich der Selbstverordnung kommen. Von Interesse ist daher, welche MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen von COVID-19-Infizierten genutzt werden. Methoden: Anonyme Querschnittsanalyse, bei der die eigenen Behandlungsoptionen in Bezug zu acht Haupt-symptomen mit Hilfe von Freitextfeldern erfasst und kategorisiert werden. Einbezogen wurden DatensÃƒÂ¤tze von Yoga-ÃƒÂ¼benden als spezifische Zielgruppe, die sich in den ZeitrÃƒÂ¤umen der drei dominanten Virus-Varianten infiziert hatten (n = 208: 89% Frauen; Altersmittel 49 Ã‚Â± 11). Die Aussagen wurden deskriptiv dargestellt und die Inhalte der Freitextfelder nach inhaltsanalytischen Gesichtspunkten kategorisiert und den jeweiligen Hauptsymptomen einer COVID-19-Infektion zugeordnet. Ergebnisse: In Bezug auf die acht Symptomgruppen ergab sich ein differenziertes Bild der als hilfreich empfundenen Behandlungsoptionen. Die meisten Nennungen hatte die Kategorie Zeit/Ruhe/Schlaf, insbesondere bei SchwÃƒÂ¤che/ErschÃƒÂ¶pfung und Rumpf-/Gliederschmerzen, gefolgt von AtemÃƒÂ¼bungen (Pranayama), die insbesondere bei Atemnot/Kurzatmigkeit und Husten zur Anwendung kamen. YogaÃƒÂ¼bungen wurden insbesondere bei Rumpf-/Gliederschmerzen sowie SchwÃƒÂ¤che/ErschÃƒÂ¶pfung genutzt. Die konventionelle Schmerzmedikation stand bei Kopfschmerzen sowie Rumpf-/Gliederschmerzen im Vordergrund. Bewegung an der frischen Luft und SpaziergÃƒÂ¤nge zur Regeneration waren relevant bei SchwÃƒÂ¤che/ErschÃƒÂ¶pfung, Atemnot/Kurzatmigkeit sowie Husten. Phytotherapeutische Anwendungen waren insbesondere bei Husten bedeutsam. Ãƒâ€žtherische Ãƒâ€“le und Riechtraining hatten ihren Schwerpunkt bei Geruchs-/GeschmacksstÃƒÂ¶rungen und Husten. Schlussfolgerungen: In Bezug auf das angewendete Spektrum der unterstÃƒÂ¼tzenden Therapieoptionen im Sinne des Selbstmanagements wurden einige sehr hÃƒÂ¤ufig und differenziert angewendet. Hier kÃƒÂ¶nnte man eine subjektiv empfundene ""NÃƒÂ¼tzlichkeit"" annehmen. In der Literatur lassen sich fÃƒÂ¼r einige dieser Optionen auch Hinweise fÃƒÂ¼r eine mÃƒÂ¶gliche Wirksamkeit finden, fÃƒÂ¼r andere nicht ohne weiteres. Diese unterstÃƒÂ¼tzenden Therapieoptionen kÃƒÂ¶nnten auÃƒÅ¸erdem eine MÃƒÂ¶glichkeit sein, um einer abwar-tenden Hilflosigkeit proaktiv entgegenzuwirken. Most COVID-19-infected people deal with the infection in their home setting and will thus presumably use symptom-relieving measures chosen from the self-prescribing realm. It is therefore of interest which treatment options are used by COVID-19-infected people. Anonymous cross-sectional analysis, in which individual treatment options are recorded with free text fields. These were subsequently categorized in relation to eight main symptom groups. Data sets from yoga practitioners were included as a specific target group, who had been infected during the periods of the three dominant virus variants (n = 208: 89% women; mean age 49 Ã‚Â± 11). Data were presented descriptively and the content of the free text fields was categorized according to content analysis aspects and assigned to the respective main symptoms of a COVID-19 infection. With regard to the eight symptom groups, a differentiated picture of the treatment options found to be helpful emerged. The category time/rest/sleep had the most mentions, especially in the case of weakness/exhaustion and pain in the trunk/limbs, followed by breathing exercises (pranayama), which were used in particular for shortness of breath and cough. Yoga exercises were used in particular for trunk/limb pain and weakness/exhaustion. Conventional pain medication was in the forefront for headaches and trunk/limb pain. Exercise in the fresh air and walks for regeneration were relevant for weakness/exhaustion, shortness of breath and cough. Phytotherapeutic applications were particularly important for coughs. Essential oils and olfactory training were used on affected smell/taste and coughs. With regard to the spectrum of supportive therapy options used in the sense of self-management, some were used very frequently and in a differentiated manner. Here one may assume a subjectively perceived Ã¢â‚¬Å“usefulness.Ã¢â‚¬Â Indications of a possible effectiveness can be found in the literature for some of these options, but not so easily for others. These supportive therapy options could also be a way to proactively counteract wait-and-see helplessness.","BÃƒÂ¼ssing","https://doi.org/10.1159/000524338","20220822","Befragung; COVID-19-Infizierte; Selbstmanagement; Supportive Behandlung; Therapieoptionen; YogaÃƒÂ¼bende","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","",36449,""
