"The effects of COVID-19 on the dispensing rates of antidepressants and benzodiazepines in Canada","Population studies have shown that rates of depressive and anxious symptoms have increased as a result of COVID-19. We analyzed trends in the dispensing rates of antidepressants and benzodiazepines in Canada to determine whether the pandemic has caused changes in rates of pharmacological treatment for depression and anxiety. We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional time-series analysis of antidepressants and benzodiazepines dispensed monthly by Canadian community pharmacies between January 2017 and December 2020. We used March 2020 as the intervention month to determine if there were any significant changes in the national rate of antidepressant and benzodiazepine tablets dispensed as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a temporary reduction in the dispensing rate of antidepressants in April 2020 (from 489 tablets per 100 in March 2020 to 356 tablets per 100 in April 2020; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001); however, the rate returned to its previous level by August 2020. There were no detectable deviations in benzodiazepine dispensing after the declaration of the state of emergency in Ontario. Despite the increased reporting of depressive and anxious symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been no changes in the dispensing trends of medications used to treat these disorders. As the pandemic continues to evolve, future research is needed to monitor the prevalence of depression and anxiety, and associated medication use, in the Canadian population.","Uthayakumar, Tadrous, Vigod, Kitchen, Gomes","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23228","20211129","COVID-19; antidepressant; anxiety; benzodiazepine; depression; medication; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22866,""
"Health co-inquiry in migraine: Online participation and stakeholder experiences before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","A migraine is more than head pain, and chronic migraine can dramatically impact a person and those around her/him/them. To better understand those effects it is important to study the experiences of persons with migraine and their caregivers, family, friends, and health and mental health providers. When they collaborate, stakeholders may improve outcomes for persons with chronic migraine. One type of stakeholder cooperation is Health Co-Inquiry, involving a person-centered approach, activation of persons toward collaboration and improved health, evidence-based practice, and integrated care. The current study investigated Health Co-Inquiry at online forums, blogs, and bulletin boards where people came together to discuss migraine. A ""Bifurcated Method"" was used to conduct inductive, thematic analyses, quantitize themes, and cross-check themes using a robot program, which crawled the Internet to gather data about stakeholder sites and posts related to migraine. Key themes in the online narratives of migraine stakeholders included seeking and providing advice, help, and information. In addition, giving personal stories and testimonials, selling computer applications and products, and providing misinformation were frequent. Differences in the types of posts by various stakeholder groups were identified and may inform researchers about their varied perspectives and goals. Remarkably, migraine is still migraine-before a pandemic and during it. As such, migraineur concerns remained stable across thematic analyses of blog and forum posts before and during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.","Baucke, Seifert, Kaelber","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260376","20211129","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22867,""
"Levels and predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress during COVID-19 pandemic among frontline healthcare providers in Gurage zonal public hospitals, Southwest Ethiopia, 2020: A multicenter cross-sectional study","The provision of quality health care during the COVID-19 pandemic depends largely on the health of health care providers. However, healthcare providers as the frontline caregivers dealing with infected patients, are more vulnerable to mental health problems. Despite this fact, there is scarce information regarding the mental health impact of COVID-19 among frontline health care providers in South-West Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the levels and predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among frontline healthcare providers in Gurage zonal public hospitals, Southwest Ethiopia, 2020. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 health care providers from November 10-25, 2020 in Gurage zonal health institutions. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. A pretested self -administered structured questionnaire was used as a data collection technique. The data were entered into the Epi-data version 3.01 and exported to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (chi-square tests) were presented Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression analyses were made to identify variables having a significant association with the dependent variables. The results of this study had shown that the overall prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress among health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 36%, [95% CI = (30.7%- 41.3%)], 25.8% [95% CI = (21.1%- 30.4%)] and 31.4% [95% CI = (26.4%- 36.0%)] respectively. Age, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR = 7.9], Educational status, [AOR = 3.2], low monthly income [AOR = 1.87], and presence of infected family members [AOR = 3.3] were statistically associated with anxiety. Besides this, gender, [AOR = 1.9], masters [AOR = 10.8], and degree holder [AOR = 2.2], living with spouse [AOR = 5.8], and family [AOR = 3.9], being pharmacists [AOR = 4.5], and physician [AOR = (0.19)], were found to be statistically significant predictors of depression among health care providers. Our study finding also showed that working at general [AOR = 4.8], and referral hospitals [AOR = 3.2], and low monthly income [AOR = 2.3] were found to be statistically significant predictors of stress among health care providers. Based on our finding significant numbers of healthcare providers were suffered from anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. So, the Government and other stakeholders should be involved and closely work and monitor the mental wellbeing of health care providers.","GebreEyesus, Tarekegn, Amlak, Shiferaw, Emeria, Geleta, Terefe, Mammo Tadereregew, Jimma, Degu, Abdisa, Eshetu, Misganaw, Chanie","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259906","20211129","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22868,""
"Can information disclosure buffer psychological anxiety due to COVID-19? Evidence from China","Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, cases of infection continue to increase and pose a great threat to the safety of people. When an individual perceives a threat in the environment, a stress reaction is automatically triggered. Long-term stress can lead to severe mental problems. Thus, the present study aims to assess the relationship between information disclosure and psychological anxiety and to determine the mediating role of epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence. A survey is conducted on 1,439 respondents to determine the mental health of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The logit method is used to explore the correlation between information disclosure and psychological anxiety. Furthermore, the bootstrap decomposition method is used to verify the mediation effects of different aspects of epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence. The study finds that information disclosure exerts a negative impact on psychological anxiety attributable to COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² = -.085, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), whereas epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence mediated the relationship between information disclosure and psychological anxiety. In exploring means to cope with challenges attributable to COVID-19, the study finds that information disclosure not only improves epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence but also buffers psychological anxiety attributable to COVID-19. Therefore, timely and accurate information from the government is beneficial for improving epidemic prevention satisfaction and epidemic prevention confidence and for alleviating psychological anxiety among Chinese residents.

"Cause or symptom? A longitudinal test of bidirectional relationships between emotion regulation strategies and mental health symptoms","Previous work has generally conceptualized emotion regulation as contributing to mental health outcomes, and not vice versa. The present study challenges this assumption by using a prospective design to investigate the directionality of underlying relationships between emotion regulation and mental health in the context of a major population-level stressor. We surveyed a large nationally representative sample of adults (18-91 years, <i>N</i> = 704) at three 1-month intervals across the acute lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, using standardized measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. At each time point, we also measured the use of two emotion regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression-previously associated with adaptive and maladaptive mental health outcomes, respectively. We found cognitive reappraisal was unrelated to mental health symptoms. In contrast, greater emotional suppression was robustly associated with higher symptom levels for both depression and anxiety. Longitudinal analyses revealed this association reflected bidirectional relationships. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety each predicted greater subsequent use of emotional suppression, and greater use of emotional suppression predicted higher subsequent symptoms. This bidirectionality suggests emotional suppression is both symptomatic and predictive of psychological distress. The lack of a relationship for cognitive reappraisal is discussed with respect to the pandemic context and evidence that high stress might reduce people's ability to use this strategy effectively. Given the strong emphasis on reappraisal in clinical practice, there is a critical need to understand for whom, what and when this strategy is helpful.

"Emotion regulation and psychological and physical health during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown","The current research tests the links between emotion regulation and psychological and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 1, parents (<i>N</i> = 365) who had reported on their psychological and physical health prior to the pandemic completed the same health assessments along with their use of emotion regulation strategies when confined in the home with their school-aged children during a nationwide lockdown. In Study 2, individuals (<i>N</i> = 1,607) from a nationally representative panel study completed similar measures of psychological and physical health and use of emotion regulation strategies one-year prior to the lockdown and then again during the lockdown. Accounting for prepandemic psychological health, greater rumination and emotional suppression were independently associated with poorer psychological health (greater depressive symptoms and psychological distress, lower emotional and personal well-being), even when controlling for the emotional challenges of the pandemic (emotion control difficulties, perceived support; Studies 1 and 2) and a range of demographic covariates (Study 2). Greater rumination was also associated with greater fatigue in both studies, but greater rumination and emotional suppression were only independently associated with poorer perceptions of physical health in Study 2. The results for cognitive reappraisal were mixed; positive associations with personal well-being and general health only emerged in Study 2. The results provide evidence that key models in affective science help explain differences in psychological and physical health within the throes of a real-world demanding context and thus offer targets to help facilitate health and resilience during the pandemic (and other crises).

"Determinants of increased frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms in exercise professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected workers in different health services including exercise professionals (EP). The urgent need to adapt in-person to online activities might have led to increased frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We aimed to identify the determinants of aggravated depressive and anxiety symptoms in EP in southern Brazil during social distancing from the COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted with EP who worked at fitness centers, sports clubs, private schools, or at a public exercise program offered by the municipal council. We used an online-based, self-administered, adapted version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale to compare symptoms of depression and anxiety pre- and during social distancing. Participants (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 201) had a mean age of 32.7Ã‚Â±8.0 years, with more than half being male, white, and having an university degree. We observed that 81%and 71%of respondents reported higher frequency in anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively, during social distancing than in the period before it. Physical education teachers, women, non-white professionals, and those with chronic disease were more likely to worsen anxiety symptoms. Women had higher odds to increased frequency in depressive symptoms. Physical activity and previous experience with internet-based tools for working activities reduced the risk of increased depressive symptoms. Sex, ethnicity, chronic diseases, educational level, physical activity, and experience with online tools were determinants for increased frequency of depression and anxiety symptoms in EP.","Feter, Caputo, Doring, da Silva, Reichert, Rombaldi","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210648","20211129","Physical education teachers; coronavirus.; depression; gym trainers; mental health; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22873,""
"The association between moral distress and mental health among nurses working at selected hospitals in Iran during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the event of an epidemic outbreak, the mental health of medical staff, including nurses who serve on the frontlines of hospitals, can be affected; thus, the identification of factors affecting nurses' mental health is of importance. This study aimed to examine the association between moral distress and the mental health of nurses working at four selected hospitals in Iran during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 296 nurses working at the selected hospitals in Bushehr and Shiraz (south of Iran) at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. The collected data were analyzed via logistic regression analysis. The mean scores for nurses' moral distress were low (54.31Ã‚Â±24.84). The results of this study indicated more symptoms of mental issues among nurses (73.60%). Moreover, a significant association was observed between mental health and moral distress. Among the examined demographic variables, only gender had a significant association with mental health (p-valueÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.014). The results of this study indicated that an increase in moral distress would lead to a significant increase in mental health issues of the examined nurses. Nurse managers and hospital policymakers should develop strategies to enhance nurses' level of mental health, as well as providing adequate emotional and family support for nurses. Considering the intensifying role of gender in this association, timely interventions are necessary to reduce the negative effects of workplace pressure/stress on female nurses.","Nemati, Moradi, Marzban, Farhadi","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210558","20211129","COVID-19; Care nursing; mental health; stress; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22874,""
"Job stress and resilience in Iranian nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case-control study","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a wide range of sociocultural pressures on nurses. Resilience is defined as one's ability to adapt to an unpredictable situation and it can be a factor in accepting an undesirable psychosocial situation. The aim of the present study was to examine resilience in nurses in the face of job stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was carried out as a case-control study with participation of 400 nurses as the target group (nurses exposed to COVID-19 patients) and the control group (nurses not exposed to COVID-19 patients). To examine resilience and job stress, Conor and Davidson's questionnaire and OSIPOW questionnaire were used respectively. The mean scores of job stress and resilience were significantly different between the target and control groups (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). So that resilience in the target group was less than that in the control group. In addition, job stress in the target group was higher than that of the control group (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). There was a significant and negative correlation between resilience and job stress and the correlation was stronger in the target group (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). Given the high job stress score in the participants and its negative correlation with resilience, there is need to provide the health personnel with efficient preventive and treatment approaches, improve and educate the principles of resilience, improve mental health services system, and introduce programs to control some of demographical factors in job stress such as physical activity, and employment status of nurses.","Shirali, Amiri, Chanani, Silavi, Mohipoor, Rashnuodi","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210476","20211129","COVID-19; job stress; nurses; psychophysical health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22875,""

The study groups composed of 400 HD, 234 oncology patients, and 276 controls. HADS anxiety and total POMS scores were significantly higher in the control group than that of both HD and oncology patients, a finding consistent with a worse mood status. In multivariate models, the male gender and the perception of having received appropriate medical support during the pandemic period were independent predictors of better POMS and HADS-anxiety and depression scores.

"Impacts of the COVID-19 confinement on air quality, the Land Surface Temperature and the urban heat island in eight cities of Andalusia (Spain)","The COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing global lockdown situation have generated a very negative impact on the world economy, but they have also lent us a unique opportunity to research and better grasp the impacts of human activity on environmental pollution and urban climates. Such studies will be of vital importance for decision-making on measures needed to mitigate the effects of climate change in urban areas, in order to turn them into resilient environments. This study looks at eight cities in the region of Andalusia (southern Spain) to comprehensively assess their environmental quality with parameters (Pm<sub>10</sub>, So<sub>2</sub>, No<sub>2</sub>, Co and O<sub>3</sub>) obtained from meteorological stations. The aim was to determine how these parameters affect the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), on the basis of Sentinel 3 satellite thermal images. Knowing to what extent improved air quality can reduce the LST and SUHI of cities will be essential in the context of future environmental studies on which to base sustainable decisions. The geographic situation of cities in the Mediterranean Sea basin, highly vulnerable to climate change, and the high pollution rates and high daily temperature variations of these urban areas make them particularly attractive for analyses of this sort. During the confinement period, average reductions of some environmental pollutants were achieved: So<sub>2</sub> (-33.5%), Pm<sub>10</sub> (-38.3%), No<sub>2</sub> (-44.0%) and Co (-26.5%). However, the environmental variable O<sub>3</sub> underwent an average growth of 5.9%. The LST showed an average reduction of -4.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C (-19.3%), while the SUHI decreased by 1.02Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C (-59.8%). These values exhibit high spatio-temporal variations between day and night, and between inland and coastal cities.","Hidalgo GarcÃƒÂ­a, Arco DÃƒÂ­az","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.100667","20211129","Air pollution; COVID- 19; Land surface temperature; Lockdown; Urban heat island; Urban resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22882,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Ophthalmological Assistance in the Emergency Department at a Spanish Primary Level Hospital","To analyze the changes in ophthalmological emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown at a Spanish primary level hospital. The number and type of emergencies attended in the emergency department of Hospital Universitario del Henares between March 10 and August 31, 2020 (COVID-19 cohort) were compared with the emergencies attended during the same period of 2019 (pre-COVID-19 cohort). Data on the diagnosis, patient age, and gender was retrospectively collected from the electronic medical records of the hospital. The different diagnoses were organized into ""clusters,"" which include those conditions that affect the same ocular tissue and that have similar clinical expression. The number of ophthalmological emergencies during the study period was 841, compared to 1343 during the same month of 2019, which represents a reduction of 37.4%. The percentage reduction in each cluster was as follows: conjunctiva (-65.4%), cornea (-35.8%), uveitis (-3.6%), eyelid and orbital and lacrimal (-35.5%), strabismus (-60%), neuro-ophthalmology (-11.8%), retina (-10.6%), cataract (+16.4%), glaucoma (-37%), and miscellaneous (-45.1%). The number of people seen with viral conjunctivitis decreased by -87.1% compared to 2019. Patients with complications due to conjunctivitis also decreased: patients with pseudomembranes dropped from 16 to 4 cases and patients with corneal subepithelial infiltrates from 9 to 3 cases. Most diagnostic clusters showed a similar decrease. Clusters that included vision-threating conditions (retina, neuro-ophthalmology, and uveitis) remained mostly stable. During the COVID-19 lockdown, the diagnosis of adenoviral conjunctivitis decreased nearly 10 times. This fact may represent a decrease in the transmission of these infections.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-MartÃƒÂ­n-Moro, GuzmÃƒÂ¡n-Almagro, Izquierdo RodrÃƒÂ­guez, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez Hortelano, Lozano Escobar, GÃƒÂ³mez Sanz, Contreras","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8023361","20211129","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22884,""
"Suicide due to fear of COVID-19, in the last month of pregnancy, leads to neonatal seizure: A case report","and importance: Limited data are available about various effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate anxiety or schizophrenia symptoms. The patient is a 5-day-old newborn, whom his mother suffers from schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. The young pregnant mother gets delusions of being infected with Covid-19, thus attempts suicide with Sertraline, Clonazepam, Quetiapine and Rispeirdone, although she was in the last week of pregnancy. The newborn baby referred to our neonatal ward with seizure and apnea. Phenytoin and caffeine were administered leading to some degree of symptom relief, but due to the dermatologic reactions of phenytoin, they were replaced with levetiracetam. The Covid-19 may increase levels of anxiety and depression or exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms, especially in pregnant women suffering from mental disorders. In addition, there are evidence supporting the occurrence of neonatal malformations as a result of exposure to antipsychotic drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Investigating the role of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs in the perinatal period, especially near delivery has received less attention so far; thus further studies are required to determine the safety of these drugs.","Boskabadi, Kargar-Soleiman Abad, Mehrpisheh, Pishavar, Farhadi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.103119","20211129","COVID-19; Case report; Mental health; Neonatal seizure; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22885,""
"Psychological Distress and Anxiety Levels Among Health Care Workers at the Height of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Arab Emirates","<b>Objectives:</b> Providing medical care during a global pandemic exposes healthcare workers (HCW) to a high level of risk, causing anxiety and stress. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and psychological distress among HCWs during COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We invited HCWs from 3 hospitals across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to participate in an anonymous online survey between April 19-May 3, 2020. The GAD-7 and K10 measures were used to assess anxiety and psychological distress. Logistic regression models assessed associations between knowledge, attitude, worry, and levels of anxiety and psychological distress. <b>Results:</b> A total of 481 HCWs participated in this study. The majority of HCWs were female (73.6%) and aged 25-34Ã‚Â years (52.6%). More than half were nurses (55.7%) and had good knowledge of COVID-19 (86.3%). Over a third (37%) of HCWs reported moderate/severe psychological distress in the K10 measure and moderate/severe anxiety (32.3%) in the GAD-7, with frontline workers significantly reporting higher levels of anxiety (36%). Knowledge of COVID-19 did not predict anxiety and psychological distress, however, HCWs who believed COVID-19 was difficult to treat and those who perceived they were at high risk of infection had worse mental health outcomes. Worry about spreading COVID-19 to family, being isolated, contracting COVID-19 and feeling stigmatized had 1.8- to 2.5-fold increased odds of symptoms of mental health problems. Additionally, HCWs who felt the need for psychological support through their workplace showed increased odds of psychological distress. <b>Conclusion:</b> HCWs in the UAE reported a high prevalence of psychological distress and anxiety while responding to the challenges of COVID-19. The findings from this study emphasize the public, emotional and mental health burden of COVID-19 and highlight the importance for health systems to implement, monitor, and update preventive policies to protect HCWs from contracting the virus while also providing psychological support in the workplace.","Saddik, Elbarazi, Temsah, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Kheder, Hussein, Najim, Bendardaf, Hamid, Halwani","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2021.1604369","20211129","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22886,""
"Perceived Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic Mediates the Association Between Self-quarantine Factors and Psychological Characteristics and Elevated Maladaptive Daydreaming","Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all countries have employed varying degrees of lockdown measures to limit the spread of the infection. Previous studies showed that individuals with maladaptive daydreaming (MD) are affected negatively by the lockdown. In this study, we explored a set of lockdown measures (e.g., self-quarantine) and personal factors (e.g., education, history of depression, and personality traits) that might potentially exacerbate MD experienced during the lockdown period. We also examined whether perceived stress acted as a mediator in the relationship between these factors and MD. During the first lockdown from April to June, we analyzed data provided by 1083 individuals from the USA, the UK, Italy, and Turkey. A path analysis revealed that perceived stress mediated the effects on MD of self-quarantine, previous episodes of depression, low education level, and introversion and emotional instability. Our study suggests a conceptual framework for the factors that intensify maladaptive daydreaming under the threats of the pandemic and forced home confinement, offering implications for interventions with vulnerable populations.","Metin, Somer, Abu-Rayya, Schimmenti, GÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ§men","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00678-w","20211129","COVID-19; Maladaptive daydreaming; Path analysis; Psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22887,""
"A Confirmation Bias View on Social Media Induced Polarisation During Covid-19","Social media has played a pivotal role in polarising views on politics, climate change, and more recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Social media induced polarisation (SMIP) poses serious challenges to society as it could enable 'digital wildfires' that can wreak havoc worldwide. While the effects of SMIP have been extensively studied, there is limited understanding of the interplay between two key components of this phenomenon: confirmation bias (reinforcing one's attitudes and beliefs) and echo chambers (i.e., hear their own voice). This paper addresses this knowledge deficit by exploring how manifestations of confirmation bias contributed to the development of 'echo chambers' at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis of data collected from 35 participants involved in supply chain information processing forms the basis of a conceptual model of SMIP and four key cross-cutting propositions emerging from the data that have implications for research and practice.","Modgil, Singh, Gupta, Dennehy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-021-10222-9","20211129","Confirmation Bias; Covid-19; Echo Chambers; Social Media Induced Polarisation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22888,""

"The state of social science research on COVID-19","Research on COVID-19 has proliferated rapidly since the outbreak of the pandemic at the end of 2019. Many articles have aimed to provide insight into this fast-growing theme. The social sciences have also put effort into research on problems related to COVID-19, with numerous documents having been published. Some studies have evaluated the growth of scientific literature on COVID-19 based on scientometric analysis, but most of these analyses focused on medical research while ignoring social science research on COVID-19. This is the first scientometric study of the performance of social science research on COVID-19. It provides insight into the landscape, the research fields, and international collaboration in this domain. Data obtained from SSCI on the Web of Science platform was analyzed using VOSviewer. The overall performance of the documents was described, and then keyword co-occurrence and co-authorship networks were visualized. The six main research fields with highly active topics were confirmed by analysis and visualization. Mental health and psychology were clearly shown to be the focus of most social science research related to COVID-19. The USA made the most contributions, with the most extensive collaborations globally, with Harvard University as the leading institution. Collaborations throughout the world were strongly related to geographical location. Considering the social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this scientometric study is significant for identifying the growth of literature in the social sciences and can help researchers within this field gain quantitative insights into the development of research on COVID-19. The results are useful for finding potential collaborators and for identifying the frontier and gaps in social science research on COVID-19 to shape future studies.","Liu, Yuan, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-04206-4","20211129","COVID-19; Scientometric; Social science; VOSviewer; Visualization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22890,""

Maryland and Mississippi PMHCA programs had 2,840 contacts with PCPs from January 2019 to March 2021. Descriptive trends on PMHCA program utilization, service type, clinical severity, diagnostic complexity, and PCP contact reasons were reported. Both programs observed significant increases in call volume during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before COVID-19. Increases were observed in calls regarding patients with multiple diagnoses (Maryland, 20% to 37%; Mississippi, 0% to 11%) as well as patients with mood and anxiety symptoms. Changes in PMHCA program usage suggest that PCPs identified more complex mental health concerns, particularly regarding mood and anxiety, during the pandemic than before COVID-19.

"Economic Precarity, Financial Strain, and Job-Related Stress Among Philadelphia's Public Mental Health Clinicians","Efforts to improve mental health treatment delivery come at a time of rising inequality and cuts or insufficient increases to mental health funding. Public mental health clinicians face increased demands, experience economic stress, and treat underresourced patients disproportionately burdened by trauma. The authors sought to understand clinicians' current economic and psychological conditions and the relationship of these conditions to the delivery of an evidence-based intervention (EBI) designed to treat posttraumatic stress disorder among youths. In July 2020, 49 public mental health clinicians from 16 Philadelphia clinics who were trained in an EBI, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), were surveyed by e-mail. Respondents reported on their economic precarity, financial strain, burnout, secondary traumatic stress (i.e., the stress response associated with caring for people exposed to trauma), and TF-CBT use. Associations between clinicians' job-related stressors and their use of TF-CBT were examined with mixed models. Content coding was used to organize clinicians' open-ended responses to questions regarding financial strain related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians' economic precarity, financial strain, and job-related stress were high; 37% of clinicians were independent contractors, 44% of whom wanted a salaried position. Of 37 clinicians with education debt, 38% reported owing Ã¢â€°Â¥$100,000. In the past year, 29% of clinicians reported lack of personal mental health care because of cost, and 22% met the cutoff for experiencing secondary traumatic stress symptoms. Education debt was negatively associated with use of TF-CBT (p&lt;0.001). The stress of providing care in underresourced clinical settings may interfere with efforts to integrate scientific evidence into mental health care.","Last, Schriger, Becker-Haimes, Fernandez-Marcote, Dallard, Jones, Beidas","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100276","20211129","Community mental health services; Mental health systems; Mental health workforce; Occupational health; Occupational stress; Service delivery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22894,""
"Male sexual functions and behaviors in the age of COVID-19: Evaluation of mid-term effects with online cross-sectional survey study","To evaluate the long-term effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on sexual functions and behavior in men with heterosexual partners. A total of 602 participants completed an online questionnaire, shared via social networks, between November 20 and December 20, 2020. Pre-pandemic sexual intercourse frequency, International Erectile Dysfunction Index (IIEF-15) score, intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) score, and activities during sexual intercourse were compared to the ones during the pandemic. In addition, the effects of various variables on participants' sexual functions were evaluated and analyzed according to age groups. The mean number of weekly sexual intercourse during the pandemic was 1.7+1.7, which was significantly lower than in the pre-pandemic period (p &lt; 0.001). The ED score was significantly lower during the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the pre-pandemic period, however orgasmic function (p = 0.016), sexual intercourse satisfaction (p &lt; 0.001), general satisfaction (p &lt; 0.001), and PEDT scores (p = 0.004) were significantly higher. There was no significant difference in IELT before and during the pandemic (p = 0.391). Full-time employment and low education level were risk factors for developing ED and PE. The negative affect of the pandemic on sexual life was most prominent in the &gt; 65 age group. Although kissing, oral and anal sex, and face-to-face sex positions decreased during the pandemic in all age groups, kissing and face-to-face sex positions remained the most preferred sexual behavior pattern (p = 0.002). There was no reduction in risky sexual behavior in the majority of the participants. At the end of one year with COVID-19, a decrease in erectile function and an increase in PE incidence were observed in men. Despite this, there was an increase in sexual desire and satisfaction.

"Associations of Post-Acute COVID syndrome with physiological and clinical measures 10 months after hospitalization in patients of the first wave","For a better understanding of the factors underlying the Post-Acute COVID Syndrome, we studied the relationship between symptoms and functional alterations in COVID-19 patients 10 months after hospitalization. One-hundred-one patients hospitalized between March 1st and June 30th 2020 participated in a follow-up visit for an assessment of clinical history, comorbidities, lung function, physical capacity and symptoms, including the SGRQ for health-related quality of life, PHQ-9-D for depression, and SOMS-2Ã‚Â J for somatoform disorders. Data were analyzed by univariate comparisons and multiple logistic regression analyses. Median age was 60 years, 42% were female, 76% had at least one comorbidity, the median length of the hospital stay was 8 days, 19% had been on the ICU. The most prevalent symptoms included shortness of breath (49%), fatigue (49%) and cognitive impairment (39%). Signs of major depression (PHQ-9-DÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 10) occurred in 28%/2% (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) of patients with/without self-reported cognitive impairment, with median total SGRQ score being 25.4/5.3 (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). There were associations between shortness of breath and BMI, SGRQ and hemoglobin levels; between fatigue, SGRQ and PHQ-9-D; and between cognitive impairment and PHQ-9-D (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05 each) but not with lung function or physical capacity. Characteristics of the acute disease were not related to symptoms. The findings demonstrate that 10 months after discharge from a hospital stay due to COVID-19, the percentages of patients with symptoms were high. Symptoms showed a consistent pattern but could not be attributed to altered lung function or physical capacity.

"Using intervention mapping to develop 'ROSE': an intervention to support peer workers in overdose response settings","Peer workers (those with lived/living experience of substance use working in overdose response settings) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives in British Columbia (BC). Working in these settings can be stressful, with lasting social, mental and emotional impacts. Peer workers have also been disproportionately burdened by the current dual public health crises characterized by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and rise in illicit drug overdose deaths. It is therefore critical to develop supports tailored specifically to their realities. We used the six steps outlined in the Intervention Mapping (IM) framework to identify needs of peer workers and design an intervention model to support peer workers in overdose response settings. Eight peer-led focus groups were conducted in community settings to identify peer workers' needs and transcripts were analyzed using interpretive description. The strategies within the intervention model were informed by organizational development theory as well as by lived/living experience of peer workers. The support needs identified by peer workers were categorized into three key themes and these formed the basis of an intervention model titled 'ROSE'; R stands for Recognition of peer work, O for Organizational support, S for Skill development and E for Everyone. The ROSE model aims to facilitate cultural changes within organizations, leading towards more equitable and just workplaces for peer workers. This, in turn, has the potential for positive socio-ecological impact. Centering lived/living experience in the intervention mapping process led us to develop a framework for supporting peer workers in BC. The ROSE model can be used as a baseline for other organizations employing peer workers.","Mamdani, McKenzie, Cameron, Knott, Conway-Brown, Scott, Buxton, Pauly","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07241-2","20211128","Peer workers; intervention mapping; lived/living experience; organization; overdose response; stigma; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22897,""
"Quality of life and mental health of children with rare congenital surgical diseases and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has affected our society at large, particularly vulnerable groups, such as children suffering from rare diseases and their parents. However, the psychosocial influences of COVID-19 on these have yet to be investigated. As such, the study's goal was to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), quality of life (QoL), and mental health of children with rare congenital surgical diseases and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. A survey of nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°210 parents of children with rare congenital surgical diseases and a control group of nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°88 parents of children without rare diseases was conducted cross-sectionally between April 2020 to April 2021. Data on HRQoL, QoL, and mental health was collected using standardized psychometric questionnaires for children and parents presenting to the pediatric surgery department at a university hospital. Mothers of children with rare pediatric surgical diseases showed significantly lower QoL and significantly higher impairment in mental health than a control group and norm data. For fathers, this was solely the case for their QoL. Children's parent-reported HRQoL and mental health were partially impaired. Social and disease-specific risk factors of the respective outcomes in affected families were identified through regression analysis models. Parents of children with rare diseases report severe psychosocial impairment regarding themselves and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, affected families should receive attention and supportive care in the form of a family-center approach to alleviate the additional burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fuerboeter, Boettcher, Barkmann, Zapf, Nazarian, Wiegand-Grefe, Reinshagen, Boettcher","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-02129-0","20211128","Health-related quality of life; Mental health; Parents; Pediatric surgery; Quality of life; Rare diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","",22898,""
