"Data Driven High Resolution Modeling and Spatial Analyses of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the world with over 90 million infections to date, and currently many countries are fighting the second wave of infections. With neither sufficient vaccination capacity nor effective medication, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remain the measure of choice. However, NPIs place a great burden on society, the mental health of individuals, and economics. Therefore the cost/benefit ratio must be carefully balanced and a target-oriented small-scale implementation of these NPIs could help achieve this balance. To this end, we introduce a modified SEIR-class compartment model and parametrize it locally for all 412 districts of Germany. The NPIs are modeled at district level by time varying contact rates. This high spatial resolution makes it possible to apply geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial patterns of the pandemic in Germany and to compare the results of different spatial resolutions. We find that the modified SEIR model can successfully be fitted to the COVID-19 cases in German districts, states, and also nationwide. We propose the correlation length as a further measure, besides the weekly incidence rates, to describe the current situation of the epidemic.","Lennart Sch&uumller; Justin M.

"Preliminary Evidence on Long COVID in children","There is increasing evidence that adult patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 suffer from Long COVID initially described in Italy. To date, data on Long COVID in children are lacking. We assessed persistent symptoms in pediatric patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19. More than a half reported at least one persisting symptom even after 120 days since COVID-19, with 42.6% being impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache , insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly frequent, as also described in adults. The evidence that COVID-19 can have long-term impact children as well, including those with asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic COVID-19, highlight the need for pediatricians, mental health experts and policy makers of implementing measures to reduce impact of the pandemic on child s health.","danilo buonsenso; Daniel Munblit; Cristina De Rose; Dario Sinatti; Antonia Ricchiuto; Angelo Carfi; Piero Valentini","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250375","20210126","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9831,""
"Mental health and wellbeing amongst people with informal caring responsibilities across different time points during the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based propensity score matching analysis","Aims. Due to a prolonged period of national and regional lockdown measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an increase reliance on informal care and a consequent increase in care intensity for informal carers. In light of this, the current study compared the experiences of carers and non-carers on various mental health and wellbeing measures across 5 key time points during the pandemic. Methods. Data analysed were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. Our study focused on 5 time points in England: (i) the first national lockdown (March-April 2020; N=12,053); (ii) the beginning of lockdown rules easing (May 2020; N=24,374); (iii) further easing (July 2020; N=21,395); (iv) new COVID-19 restrictions (September 2020; N=4,792); and (v) the three-tier system restrictions (October 2020; N=4,526). We considered 5 mental health and wellbeing measures- depression, anxiety, loneliness, life satisfaction and sense of worthwhile. Propensity score matching were applied for the analyses. Results. We found that informal carers experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety than non-carers across all time points. During the first national lockdown, carers also experienced a higher sense of life being worthwhile. No association was found between informal caring responsibilities and levels of loneliness and life satisfaction. Conclusion. Given that carers are an essential national health care support, especially during a pandemic, it is crucial to integrate carers' needs into healthcare planning and delivery. These results highlight there is a pressing need to provide adequate and targeted mental health support for carers during and following this pandemic.","Hei Wan Mak; Feifei Bu; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250045","20210125","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9832,""
"Mental Health, Substance Use, and Wellbeing in Higher Education","Student wellbeing is foundational to academic success  One recent survey of postsecondary educators found that nearly 80 percent believed emotional wellbeing is a ""very"" or ""extremely"" important factor in student success  Studies have found the dropout rates for students with a diagnosed mental health problem range from 43 percent to as high as 86 percent  While dealing with stress is a normal part of life, for some students, stress can adversely affect their physical, emotional, and psychological health, particularly given that adolescence and early adulthood are when most mental illnesses are first manifested  In addition to students who may develop mental health challenges during their time in postsecondary education, many students arrive on campus with a mental health problem or having experienced significant trauma in their lives, which can also negatively affect physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing  The nation's institutions of higher education are seeing increasing levels of mental illness, substance use and other forms of emotional distress among their students  Some of the problematic trends have been ongoing for decades  Some have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic consequences  Some are the result of long-festering systemic racism in almost every sphere of American life that are becoming more widely acknowledged throughout society and must, at last, be addressed  Mental Health, Substance Use, and Wellbeing in Higher Education lays out a variety of possible strategies and approaches to meet increasing demand for mental health and substance use services, based on the available evidence on the nature of the issues and what works in various situations  The recommendations of this report will support the delivery of mental health and wellness services by the nation's institutions of higher education","Leshner, A.

"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chinese Health Care Workers: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has dominated headlines worldwide. The number of infections has continued to rise and had reached 30,000 worldwide at the time this paper was written. Because of the high risk of nosocomial transmission, medical health care workers may be experiencing substantial psychological stress. This descriptive study aimed to identify psychosocial effects on hospital staff associated with working in a hospital environment during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our survey participants included 57 frontline clinicians working at Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical students working at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaire we adopted included questions regarding the participants' personal well-being, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychological status. METHODS: 57 frontline clinicians working in Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical training students working in Jiangsu Provincial Peoples Hospital during this outbreak participated in our survey. The questionnaire we adopted included questions regarding the participants' personal well-being, sociodemographic characteristics and the psychological status. RESULTS: The COVID-19 outbreak had psychological impacts both on formal workers and medical students. The psychological effects included sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. There was no significant difference between the group of formal workers and medical students (P=.85), and more than 50% (30/54, 56%, vs. 83/157, 52.9%) of the respondents reported pandemic-related mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure caused substantial psychological stress among health care workers. This finding emphasizes the need to promote psychological crisis intervention for medical personnel during this epidemic.","Ni, Jie; Wang, Fang; Liu, Yihai; Wu, Mingyue; Jiang, Yan; Zhou, Yujie; Zhou, Yujie; Sha, Dujuan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23125","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e23125, 2021 Jan 20.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e23125, 2021 Jan 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9850,""
"Implementation of Telehealth Services to Assess, Monitor, and Treat Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Systematic Review","BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, there has been increasing momentum in telehealth development and delivery. To assess the anticipated exponential growth in telehealth, it is important to accurately capture how telehealth has been used in specific mental health fields prior to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to highlight how telehealth has been used with clinical samples in the neurodevelopmental field, including patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), their families, and health care professionals. To identify which technologies show the greatest potential for implementation into health services, we evaluated technologies for effectiveness, economic impact, and readiness for clinical adoption. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was undertaken in April 2018 and updated until December 2019, by using the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, and PsycInfo databases. Extracted data included the type of technology, how the technology was used (ie, assessment, treatment, and monitoring), participant characteristics, reported outcomes and authors' views on clinical effectiveness, user impact (ie, feasibility and acceptability), economic impact, and readiness for clinic adoption. A quality review of the research was performed in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included participants and family members with autism spectrum disorders (21/42, 50%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (8/42, 19%), attention deficit hyperactivity or autism spectrum disorders (3/42, 7%), communication disorders (7/42, 17%), and tic disorders (2/42, 5%). The focus of most studies (33/42, 79%) was on treatment, rather than assessment (4/42, 10%) or monitoring (5/42, 12%). Telehealth services demonstrated promise for being clinically effective, predominantly in relation to diagnosing and monitoring NDDs. In terms of NDD treatment, telehealth services were usually equivalent to control groups. There was some evidence of positive user and economic impacts, including increased service delivery efficiency (eg, increased treatment availability and decreased waiting times). However, these factors were not widely recorded across the studies. Telehealth was demonstrated to be cost-effective in the few studies that considered cost-effectiveness. Study quality varied, as many studies had small sample sizes and inadequate control groups. Of the 42 studies, only 11 (26%) were randomized controlled trials, 12 (29%) were case studies or case series, 6 (14%) were qualitative studies, and 5 (12%) were noncomparative trials. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has the potential to increase treatment availability, decrease diagnosis waiting times, and aid in NDD monitoring. Further research with more robust and adequately powered study designs that consider cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency is needed. This systematic review highlights the extent of telehealth technology use prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement for investing in remote access to treatments.

"Reports of Forgone Medical Care Among US Adults During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major disruptions in the US health care system. Objective: To estimate frequency of and reasons for reported forgone medical care from March to mid-July 2020 and examine characteristics of US adults who reported forgoing care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the second wave of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey, fielded from July 7 to July 22, 2020. Respondents included a national sample of 1337 individuals aged 18 years or older in the US who were part of National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel. Exposures: The initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, defined as from March to mid-July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were missed doses of prescription medications; forgone preventive and other general medical care, mental health care, and elective surgeries; forgone care for new severe health issues; and reasons for forgoing care. Results: Of 1468 individuals who completed wave 1 of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey (70.4% completion rate), 1337 completed wave 2 (91.1% completion rate). The sample of respondents included 691 (52%) women, 840 non-Hispanic White individuals (63%), 160 non-Hispanic Black individuals (12%), and 223 Hispanic individuals (17%). The mean (SE) age of respondents was 48 (0.78) years. A total of 544 respondents (41%) forwent medical care from March through mid-July 2020. Among 1055 individuals (79%) who reported needing care, 544 (52%) reported forgoing care for any reason, 307 (29%) forwent care owing to fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, and 75 (7%) forwent care owing to financial concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were unemployed, compared with those who were employed, forwent care more often (121 of 186 respondents [65%] vs 251 of 503 respondents [50%]; P = .01) and were more likely to attribute forgone care to fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (78 of 186 respondents [42%] vs 120 of 503 respondents [24%]; P = .002) and financial concerns (36 of 186 respondents [20%] vs 28 of 503 respondents [6%]; P = .001). Respondents lacking health insurance were more likely to attribute forgone care to financial concerns than respondents with Medicare or commercial coverage (19 of 88 respondents [22%] vs 32 of 768 respondents [4%]; P < .001). Frequency of and reasons for forgone care differed in some instances by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and health status. Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study found a high frequency of forgone care among US adults from March to mid-July 2020. Policies to improve health care affordability and to reassure individuals that they can safely seek care may be necessary with surging COVID-19 case rates.","Anderson, Kelly E; McGinty, Emma E; Presskreischer, Rachel; Barry, Colleen L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.34882","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(1): e2034882, 2021 01 04.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(1): e2034882, 2021 01 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9855,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on Physical Activity Among 10,000 Steps Members and Engagement With the Program in Australia: Prospective Study","BACKGROUND: Physical activity is an important health behavior, due to its association with many physical and mental health conditions. During distressing events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a concern that physical activity levels may be negatively impacted. However, recent studies have shown inconsistent results. Additionally, there is a lack of studies in Australia on this topic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate changes in physical activity reported through the 10,000 Steps program and changes in engagement with the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020, from registered members of the 10,000 Steps program, which included 3,548,825 days with step data, were used. The number of daily steps were logged manually by the members or synced automatically from their activity trackers connected to the program. Measures on program usage were the number of new registered members per day, the number of newly registered organizations per day, the number of steps logged per day, and the number of step entries per day. Key dates used for comparison were as follows: the first case with symptoms in Wuhan, China; the first case reported in Australia; the implementation of a 14-day ban for noncitizens arriving in Australia from China; the start of the lockdown in Australia; and the relaxing of restrictions by the Australian Government. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test for significant differences in number of steps between subgroups, between engagement measures in 2019 versus 2020, and before and after an event. RESULTS: A decrease in steps was observed after the first case in Australia was reported (1.5%; P=.02) and after the start of the lockdown (3.4%; P<.001). At the time that the relaxing of restrictions started, the steps had already recovered from the lockdown. Additionally, the trends were consistent across genders and age groups. New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria had the greatest step reductions, with decreases of 7.0% (P<.001), 6.2% (P=.02), and 4.7% (P<.001), respectively. During the lockdown, the use of the program increased steeply. On the peak day, there were more than 9000 step entries per day, with nearly 100 million steps logged per day; in addition, more than 450 new users and more than 15 new organizations registered per day, although the numbers decreased quickly when restrictions were relaxed. On average per day, there were about 55 new registered users (P<.001), 2 new organizations (P<.001), 25.6 million steps (P<.001), and 2672 log entries (P<.001) more in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had negative effects on steps among Australians across age groups and genders. However, the effect was relatively small, with steps recovering quickly after the lockdown. There was a large increase in program usage during the pandemic, which might help minimize the health impact of the lockdown and confirms the important role of physical activity programs during times of distress and lockdowns.","To, Quyen G; Duncan, Mitch J; Van Itallie, Anetta; Vandelanotte, Corneel","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23946","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e23946, 2021 Jan 25.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e23946, 2021 Jan 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9857,""
"Social relationships and depression during the COVID-19 lockdown: longitudinal analysis of the COVID-19 Social Study","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to measures that reduced social contact and support. We explored whether UK residents with more frequent or supportive social contact had fewer depressive symptoms during March-August 2020, and potential factors moderating the relationship. METHODS: A convenience sample of UK dwelling participants aged Ã¢Â©Â¾18 in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to 22 weekly questionnaires about face-to-face and phone/video social contact frequency, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9. Mixed linear models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined for interaction by empathic concern, perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency. RESULTS: In 71 117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15), those with high perceived social support scored 1.836 (1.801-1.871) points lower on PHQ-9 than those with low support. Daily face-to-face or phone/video contact was associated with lower depressive symptoms (0.258 (95% confidence interval 0.225-0.290) and 0.117 (0.080-0.154), respectively) compared to no contact. The negative association between social relationships and depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual sociability. CONCLUSIONS: We found during lockdown that those with higher quality or more face-to-face or phone/video contact had fewer depressive symptoms. Contact quality was more strongly associated than quantity. People who were usually more sociable or had higher empathy had more depressive symptoms during enforced reduced contact. The results have implications for COVID-19 and potential future pandemic management, and for understanding the relationship between social factors and mental health.","Sommerlad, Andrew; Marston, Louise; Huntley, Jonathan; Livingston, Gill; Lewis, Gemma; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721000039","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-10, 2021 Jan 13.; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-10, 2021 Jan 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9858,""
"Increases in depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] pandemic has introduced extraordinary life changes and stress, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Initial reports suggest that depression and anxiety are elevated during COVID-19, but no prior study has explored changes at the within-person level. The current study explored changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from before the pandemic to soon after it first peaked in Spring 2020 in a sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 451) living in Long Island, New York, an early epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S. METHODS: Depression (Children's Depression Inventory) and anxiety symptoms (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Symptoms) were assessed between December 2014 and July 2019, and, along with COVID-19 experiences, symptoms were re-assessed between March 27th and May 15th, 2020. RESULTS: Across participants and independent of age, there were increased generalized anxiety and social anxiety symptoms. In females, there were also increased depression and panic/somatic symptoms. Multivariable linear regression indicated that greater COVID-19 school concerns were uniquely associated with increased depression symptoms. Greater COVID-19 home confinement concerns were uniquely associated with increased generalized anxiety symptoms, and decreased social anxiety symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults at an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. experienced increased depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly amongst females. School and home confinement concerns related to the pandemic were independently associated with changes in symptoms. Overall, this report suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is having multifarious adverse effects on the mental health of youth.","Hawes, Mariah T; Szenczy, Aline K; Klein, Daniel N; Hajcak, Greg; Nelson, Brady D","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720005358","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-9, 2021 Jan 13.; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-9, 2021 Jan 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9859,""
"Maternal mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in China, Italy, and the Netherlands: a cross-validation study","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had brought negative consequences and new stressors to mothers. The current study aims to compare factors predicting maternal mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in China, Italy, and the Netherlands. METHODS: The sample consisted of 900 Dutch, 641 Italian, and 922 Chinese mothers (age M = 36.74, s.d. = 5.58) who completed an online questionnaire during the lockdown. Ten-fold cross-validation models were applied to explore the predictive performance of related factors for maternal mental health, and also to test similarities and differences between the countries. RESULTS: COVID-19-related stress and family conflict are risk factors and resilience is a protective factor in association with maternal mental health in each country. Despite these shared factors, unique best models were identified for each of the three countries. In Italy, maternal age and poor physical health were related to more mental health symptoms, while in the Netherlands maternal high education and unemployment were associated with mental health symptoms. In China, having more than one child, being married, and grandparental support for mothers were important protective factors lowering the risk for mental health symptoms. Moreover, high SES (mother's high education, high family income) and poor physical health were found to relate to high levels of mental health symptoms among Chinese mothers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are important for the identification of at-risk mothers and the development of mental health promotion programs during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Guo, Jing; De Carli, Pietro; Lodder, Paul; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian J; Riem, Madelon M E","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720005504","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-11, 2021 Jan 13.; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-11, 2021 Jan 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9860,""
"Philosophy for children and mindfulness during COVID-19: Results from a randomized cluster trial and impact on mental health in elementary school students","Preliminary evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on children's mental health. Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and a P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. Results from this study suggest that in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.","Malboeuf-Hurtubise, LÃƒÂ©ger-Goodes, Mageau, Joussemet, Herba, Chadi, LefranÃƒÂ§ois, Camden, BussiÃƒÂ¨res, Taylor, Ãƒâ€°thier, Gagnon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110260","20210125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9861,""
"Evaluating Mental Health-Related Symptoms Among Cancer Survivors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of the COVID Impact Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of adults in the United States because of recommended preventive behaviors such as physical distancing. Our objective was to evaluate mental health symptoms and identify associated determinants among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We used nationally representative data of 10,760 US adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n = 854, 7.6%). We estimated associations of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors using multinomial logistic regression. We estimated determinants of reporting at least one mental health symptom 3-7 times in the 7 days before survey administration among cancer survivors using multivariable Poisson regression. Cancer survivors were more likely to report feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.90); depressed (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.09); lonely (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.91); and hopeless (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.06) 3-7 days per week in the last 7 days when compared with adults without cancer. Among cancer survivors, adults of age 30-44 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.95), females (aPR, 1.55, 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.13), adults without a high school degree (aPR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.04), and adults with limited social interaction (aPR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.95) were more likely to report at least one mental health-related symptom in the last 7 days (3-7 days/week). Cancer survivors are reporting mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly young adults, adults without a high school degree, women, and survivors with limited social support.","Islam, Vidot, Camacho-Rivera","https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.20.00752","20210125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9862,""
"Postpartum Depressive Symptoms during the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Examination of Population Birth Data from Central New Jersey","To examine the mental health of women in the perinatal period prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use provisional vital statistics data for births occurring in the central region of New Jersey. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is employed to assess depressive symptoms. Our focal analysis uses linear regression models to test whether giving birth during the pandemic is associated with elevated depressive symptoms. All analyses are performed using time-matched (September 2019-April 2020; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18,531) and month-matched (January 2019-April 2019 and January 2020- April 2020; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18,346) samples. Women who gave birth in March and not in April reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who gave birth prior to the pandemic in our time-matched (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09) and month-matched (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09) samples. The magnitude of this association is approximately one-third the magnitude of the association between preterm birth and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that researchers and practitioners should pay special attention to signs of postpartum depression and women's adaptive coping responses in the early stages of pandemics.","McFarland, McFarland, Hill, D'Oria","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-03116-w","20210125","Antenatal screening; COVID-19; Postpartum depression; Vital statistics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9863,""
"Physical exercise effects on the brain during COVID-19 pandemic: links between mental and cardiovascular health","The current pandemic was caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The quarantine period during corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak might affect the quality of life leading thousands of individuals to diminish the daily caloric expenditure and mobility, leading to a sedentary behavior and increase the number of health disorders. Exercising is used as a non-pharmacological treatment in many chronic diseases. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of physical exercise in COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. We also point links between exercise, mental, and cardiovascular health. The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects host cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. If there is not enough oxygen supply the lungs and other tissues, such as the heart or brain, are affected. SARS-CoV-2 enhances ACE2 leading to inflammation and neuronal death with possible development of mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Physical exercise also enhances the ACE2 expression. Conversely, the activation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis by physical exercise induces an antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effect. Physical exercise has beneficial effects on mental health enhancing IGF-1, PI3K, BDNF, ERK, and reducing GSK3ÃŽÂ² levels. In addition, physical exercise enhances the activity of PGC-1ÃŽÂ±/ FNDC5/Irisin pathway leading to neuronal survival and the maintenance of a good mental health. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to elevation of ACE2 levels through pathological mechanisms that lead to neurological and cardiovascular complications, while the physiological response of ACE2 to physical exercise improves cardiovascular and mental health.","De Sousa, Improta-Caria, Aras-JÃƒÂºnior, de Oliveira, Soci, Cassilhas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05082-9","20210125","Anxiety; Corona virus; Depression; Heart; Inflammation; Physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9864,""
"Exploring the Efficacy of Telehealth for Family Therapy Through Systematic, Meta-analytic, and Qualitative Evidence","There is a current escalating need for telehealth (TH) options in family mental health services. In the absence of replicated evidence, TH guidelines from peak bodies are largely based on assumptions of the effectiveness of TH methods. New investments in TH would optimally be based in evidence of clinical efficacy. To this end, we conducted three studies in which we (1) systematically reviewed eight professional guidelines for TH family therapy, (2) examined replicated evidence for the efficacy of TH family therapy through systematic review of 20 studies and meta-analyses of 13 effects, and (3) synthesised clinical accommodations to TH methodology from a study of 12 experienced TH family therapists. The studies found (1) a predominant focus in existing TH guidelines on operational matters pertaining to TH and relative neglect of therapeutic process; (2) meta-analyses of efficacy for child behavioural problems (kÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8) and parental depression (kÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5) showed equivalent outcomes in TH and face-to-face therapy and enhanced outcomes in TH relative to treatment as usual, resource provision (i.e. written materials), or wait-list control. Narrative review of 20 studies for a range of relational and mental health outcomes aligned with these findings; and (3) therapists defined clear conditions for enhanced engagement and therapeutic process via TH and reflected on cautions and accommodations for purposes of rapport building and mitigating risk. Given moderate-strong evidence for the efficacy of TH methods of family therapy for a range of conditions, we offer recommendations for future implementation of TH for family therapy.","McLean, Booth, Schnabel, Wright, Painter, McIntosh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-020-00340-2","20210125","COVID-19; Family therapy; Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9865,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life and mental health in children and adolescents in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented changes in the lives of 1.6 billion children and adolescents. First non-representative studies from China, India, Brazil, the US, Spain, Italy, and Germany pointed to a negative mental health impact. The current study is the first nationwide representative study to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health of children and adolescents in Germany from the perspective of children themselves. A representative online survey was conducted among nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1586 families with 7- to 17-year-old children and adolescents between May 26 and June 10. The survey included internationally established and validated instruments for measuring HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-10), mental health problems (SDQ), anxiety (SCARED), and depression (CES-DC). Results were compared with data from the nationwide, longitudinal, representative BELLA cohort study (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1556) conducted in Germany before the pandemic. Two-thirds of the children and adolescents reported being highly burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. They experienced significantly lower HRQoL (40.2% vs. 15.3%), more mental health problems (17.8% vs. 9.9%) and higher anxiety levels (24.1% vs. 14.9%) than before the pandemic. Children with low socioeconomic status, migration background and limited living space were affected significantly more. Health promotion and prevention strategies need to be implemented to maintain children's and adolescents' mental health, improve their HRQoL, and mitigate the burden caused by COVID-19, particularly for children who are most at risk.","Ravens-Sieberer, Kaman, Erhart, Devine, Schlack, Otto","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01726-5","20210125","Anxiety; COVID-19; Children and adolescents; Depression; Mental health; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9866,""
"Occupational burnout among active physiotherapists working in clinical hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in south-eastern Poland","Occupational burnout, which is more and more commonly encountered among medical professionals and investigated by researchers worldwide, may in particular affect health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to assess the risk of occupational burnout among physiotherapists working actively in clinical hospitals in south-eastern Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. The level of burnout among the studied physiotherapists was assessed using the Polish version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory by Maslach (MBI). The study was conducted from 20 March to 3 May, 2020 among physiotherapists working professionally during the COVID-19 pandemic in the south east of Poland, during which time health services related to therapeutic rehabilitation were suspended. The study was conducted among 1,540 physiotherapists with a license to practice who worked in clinical departments. Considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 106 physiotherapists were qualified for the study. The current findings show that during the COVID-19 pandemic physiotherapists present high burnout rates in all three dimensions: EE (Mean 32.31; CI 29.47-35.15); DP (Mean 16.25; CI 14.48-18.03); PA (Mean 26.25; CI 24.41-28.10). As for gender-related effects, higher burnout rates were observed in the male workers, compared to the females, in all three domains: EE (Men: Mean 34.70; CI 29.90-39.50 -Women: Mean 31.03; CI 27.45-34.60); DP (Men: Mean 18.78; CI 15.98-21.59 -Women: Mean 14.90; CI 12.64-17.16) and PA (Men: Mean 24.54; CI 21.32-27.76 -Women: Mean 27.17; CI 24.90-29.44). The highest burnout rates, presented by the physiotherapists working in the profession for more than 20 years, were identified in the domain of EE (Mean: 35.30; CI 30.51-40.10) and in those with 10-15 years of experience, in the domains of DP (Mean: 18.31; CI 14.89-21.73) and PA (Mean: 23.97; CI 20.13-27.81). The highest rate of occupational burnout, reflected by the scores in all three domains (EE, DP, PA), was identified in Department I -Intensive Care and Anaesthesiology Department: EE - (Mean: 40.89, CI 35.27-46.52); DP - (Mean: 21.39, CI 17.90-24.88); and PA - (Mean: 23.07, CI 20.04-26.10), compared to the other departments. The subjects who rarely participated in courses or training programs showed the highest burnout rates (EE- Mean: 33.55, CI 29.33-37.77; DP- Mean: 16.71, CI 13.99-19.43; PA- Mean: 25.45, CI 22.47-28.43). Occupational burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic is noticeable among physiotherapists working in clinical departments. The current findings show high burnout rates in all three domains: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). A comparative analysis of these findings with reference to related studies published before the pandemic shows that the burnout rates among physiotherapists may have significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the scarcity of scientific evidence related to this specific problem in Poland and worldwide, it is necessary to continue research in occupational burnout affecting physiotherapists, particularly during the second wave of the pandemic, in order to gain a better understanding of the possible effects of social isolation and greater personal work-related health risks on the mental health of these medical professionals.","Pniak, Leszczak, Adamczyk, Rusek, MatÃ…â€šosz, Guzik","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-203375","20210125","Health workers; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9867,""

"Psychological Health of Surgeons in a Time of COVID-19: A Global Survey","To assess the degree of psychological impact among surgical providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has extensively impacted global healthcare systems. We hypothesized that the degree of psychological impact would be higher for surgical providers deployed for COVID-19 work, certain surgical specialties, and for those who knew of someone diagnosed with, or who died, of COVID-19. We conducted a global web-based survey to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19. The primary outcomes were the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores. 4283 participants from 101 countries responded. 32.8%, 30.8%, 25.9% and 24.0% screened positive for depression, anxiety, stress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) respectively. Respondents who knew someone who died of COVID-19 were more likely to screen positive for depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD (OR 1.3, 1,6, 1.4, 1.7 respectively, all p &lt; 0.05).

Surgical specialities that operated in the Head and Neck region had higher psychological distress among its surgeons. Deployment for COVID-19-related work was not associated with increased psychological distress. The COVID-19 pandemic may have a mental health legacy outlasting its course.

"Public perspectives on firearm sales in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, firearm sales surged to record-breaking levels in the United States. The purpose of this study was to conduct a national assessment of the views of Americans on the change in firearm sales, the perceived impact of the changes in sales, and how these perceptions differ by a recent purchase of a firearm. A multi-item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites in the last week of May 2020 to recruit adult Americans in the general population across the United States. Among the total sample of study participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1432), almost a fifth (18%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 263) reported buying a firearm during the pandemic. Firearm buyers differed statistically significantly (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) from non-buyers based on sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, education, having children at home, employment status, income, political orientation, location, and region of residence in the United States. Those who did not buy firearms during the pandemic were significantly (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) more likely to believe that firearm sales and first-time ownership/buying of firearms had increased during the pandemic. Similarly, those who did not buy a firearm during the pandemic were significantly more likely to believe that the surge in firearm sales would result in increased firearm access for children, mentally ill, drug users, criminals, and older adults. In relation to perceived changes in selected public health outcomes attributed to the surge in firearm sales, firearm buyers were significantly less likely (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) to believe that an increase in sales could result in adverse public health outcomes such as a higher number of suicides, homicides, mass shootings, and crimes in society. In multiple regression analyses, significant predictors of pandemic purchase of firearms were: having children at home, owning firearms before the pandemic, planning to buy firearms in the next year, knowing someone who was shot or killed with a firearm, and personally experiencing firearm violence in the past (ie, threatened or shot with a firearm). This study delineated the characteristics of those who purchased a firearm during the pandemic and the reasons for such purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Burnout among Healthcare Providers of COVID-19; a Systematic Review of Epidemiology and Recommendations","In the current systematic review, we intended to systematically review the epidemiology of burnout and the strategies and recommendations to prevent or reduce it among healthcare providers (HCPs) of COVID-19 wards, so that policymakers can make more appropriate decisions. MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed), Science Direct, and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched in English from December 01, 2019 to August 15, 2020, using MESH terms and related keywords. After reading the title and the abstract, unrelated studies were excluded. The full texts of the studies were evaluated by authors, independently, and the quality of the studies was determined. Then, the data were extracted and reported. 12 studies were included. Five studies investigated the risks factors associated with burnout; none could establish a causal relationship because of their methodology. No study examined any intervention to prevent or reduce burnout, and the provided recommendations were based on the authors' experiences and opinions.

"Real-Time Telehealth Treatment Team Consultation for Self-Injury by Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder","Self-injurious behavior (SIB) refers to any repeated self-directed, non-suicidal, behavior that may cause or has the potential to cause physical harm to the person's body. Behavioral interventions provide the standard evidence-based treatments for SIB by people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). Translating the proven effectiveness of behavioral interventions to treatment of self-injury in community settings by clinicians and caregivers has not been totally successful. The aim of the present study was to advance translational research by providing real-time telehealth consultation to a treatment team at a community-based mental health agency that provided inpatient and outpatient services to individuals with ASD and ID. The participants of this single-case experimental study were three adolescents with ASD who had been referred for services because of their increasingly unmanageable SIB both at home and at school. The telehealth consultant provided real-time assistance to the treatment team within a translational model of care in the development and implementation of a behavior support plan and an informal mindfulness-based Soles of the Feet (SoF) program. Both visual and statistical analyses demonstrated reductions in the frequency of SIB for all three adolescents, with overall clinically significant reductions only with the SoF intervention. The results of this translational study suggest that telehealth consultation might be a viable technological alternative in situations which preclude face-to-face consultation. Telehealth consultation could be one method of supporting people with behavioral difficulties during pandemics, such as COVID-19.","Singh, Lancioni, Medvedev, Hwang, Myers","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41252-021-00192-z","20210125","Behavior support plans; COVID-19; Self-injury; Soles of the Feet (SoF); Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9876,""

"Hospital Preparedness, Resilience, and Psychological Burden Among Clinical Nurses in Addressing the COVID-19 Crisis in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","In the continuous effort to minimize the devastating effects of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and to curb the spread of the disease, hospital preparedness and resilience play significant roles in the psychological well-being of clinical nurses given that their work demands immediate action to adapt and adjust to stressors. Thus, this study investigates the hospital preparedness, psychological burden, and resilience of clinical nurses in addressing COVID-19 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 281 clinical nurses participated in the survey from April 2020 to June 2020. Results show that clinical nurses perceived a high self-assessed COVID-19 hospital preparedness (49.65, <i>SD</i> = 2.30); high self-assessed nurses' resilience (4.03, <i>SD</i> = 0.36); and most have normal levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The variables were predicted to be statistically significant (<i>F</i><sub>18,262</sub> = 4.14, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and accounted for 16.8% of the variance in the nurses' perception of hospital preparedness (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.221; adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.168). The regression analysis was statistically significant (<i>F</i><sub>30,250</sub> = 6.71, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and accounted for 38% of the variance in nurses' resilience (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.446, Adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.380). The predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress show that the overall relationship was statistically significant at (<i>F</i><sub>23,257</sub> = 6.71, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), (<i>F</i><sub>23,257</sub> = 6.675, <i>p</i> 0.000), and (<i>F</i><sub>23,257</sub> = 6.692, <i>p</i> 0.000) with 31.9% of the variance (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.375, Adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.319), 31.8% of the variance (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.374, Adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.318), and 31.9 % of the variance (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.375, Adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.319), respectively. The findings of this study helps in improving the continuing education program, psychological support, and mental health program to ensure that the needs of clinical nurses are addressed during the outbreak of a disease.","Balay-Odao, Alquwez, Inocian, Alotaibi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.573932","20210125","COVID-19 crisis; clinical nurses; hospital preparedness; nurses' resilience; psychological burden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9878,""
"Personality, Coping Strategies, and Mental Health in High-Performance Athletes During Confinement Derived From the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the sports field unprecedentedly. The emergency alert has deprived athletes of training in a suitable environment, as they are faced with cancellations of relevant events in their sports careers. This situation can cause stress levels and other emotional disorders similar to those experienced by athletes during periods of injury. Since the relationship between psychological factors and sports injuries is well-studied, the Global Psychological Model of Sports Injury (MGPLD) is applied to this historical situation for athletes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationships between perfectionism and trait anxiety with indicators of mental health (mood, depression, state anxiety, and stress) in high-performance athletes during confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to explore the coping strategies that athletes have applied and whether they are perceived as useful for managing negative emotional states. A cross-sectional study was conducted through online questionnaires during April 2020, adapting the Psychological Assessment Protocol of the High-Performance Sports Center of Murcia (Spain), to assess the psychological effects of confinement in a cross-cultural sample of 310 athletes (141 women and 169 men) from different countries in Europe, Asia, and America, and from diverse sports disciplines. The protocol comprised six instruments that test perfectionism, trait anxiety, mood states, stress, depression, coping strategies, and sleep. It was answered online via Google Forms. The results show that maladaptive perfectionism was related to all the indicators of athletes' mental health. However, athletes' levels of anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms are relatively low, and the use of coping strategies such as cognitive restructuring and emotional calm was associated with lower levels of negative emotional states. Besides, the Iceberg Profile, a suitable fit for the mental health model, is observed in the mood of athletes, both in men and in women, although women showed higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression than men. A strong relationship was observed between maladaptive perfectionism and martial arts sports discipline, superior to other sports. In short, it can be concluded that high-performance athletes in the studied sample showed negative emotional state values below the expected average. Finally, the proposals for practical applications of the results collected are discussed.","Leguizamo, Olmedilla, NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez, Verdaguer, GÃƒÂ³mez-Espejo, Ruiz-BarquÃƒÂ­n, Garcia-Mas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.561198","20210125","COVID-19; confinement; coping; high-performance athletes; personality; sports psychology; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9879,""
"Face coverings and respiratory tract droplet dispersion","Respiratory droplets are the primary transmission route for SARS-CoV-2, a principle which drives social distancing guidelines. Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we set out to quantify the effects of face coverings on respiratory tract droplet deposition. We tested an anatomically realistic manikin head which ejected fluorescent droplets of water and human volunteers, in speaking and coughing conditions without a face covering, or with a surgical mask or a single-layer cotton face covering. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2 m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5 cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by less than 1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2 m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 10 000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 0.5 m away wearing a basic single-layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets and thus provide an opportunity to moderate social distancing policies. However, the methodologies we employed mostly detect larger (non-aerosol) sized droplets. If the aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.","Bandiera, Pavar, Pisetta, Otomo, Mangano, Seckl, Digard, Molinari, Menolascina, Viola","https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201663","20210125","COVID-19; face covering; handmade mask; respiratory droplets; social distancing; surgical mask","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9880,""
"Time and Emotion During Lockdown and the Covid-19 Epidemic: Determinants of Our Experience of Time?","To fight against the spread of the coronavirus disease, more than 3 billion people in the world have been confined indoors. Although lockdown is an efficient solution, it has had various psychological consequences that have not yet been fully measured. During the lockdown period in France (April 2020), we conducted two surveys on two large panels of participants to examine how the lockdown disrupted their relationship with time and what this change in their experiences of time means. Numerous questions were asked about the experience of time but also the nature of life during the lockdown: the emotions felt, boredom, the activities performed, sleep quality, and the daily rhythm. The participants also completed a series of self-reported scales used to assess depression, anxiety, and impulsivity. The results showed that time seemed to pass more slowly during the lockdown compared to before. This feeling of a slowing down of time has little to do with living conditions during the lockdown and individual psychological characteristics. The main predictor of this time experience was boredom and partly mediated by the lack of activity. The feeling of being less happy and the presence of sleep disturbance also explained this specific experience of time albeit to a lesser extent.","Martinelli, Gil, Belletier, ChevalÃƒÂ¨re, Dezecache, Huguet, Droit-Volet","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.616169","20210125","Covid-19; boredom; emotion; lockdown; sleep; time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9881,""

Respondents completed the COVID-TIS (Transitional Impact Scale-Pandemic version) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), indicated their level of COVID-infection concern for themselves and close others, and provided demographic information. The results indicated: (a) during its early stage, the pandemic produced only moderate levels of material and psychological change; (b) the pandemic produced mild to moderate levels of psychological distress; (c) respondents who lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic experienced more change and more psychological distress than those who did not, and (d) younger respondents and less well-educated ones experienced more psychological distress than older respondents. Unexpectedly, (e) respondents indicated that they were more concerned that friends and family members would become infected with COVID-19 than that they would be. We conclude by speculating that these results are driven less by the immediate changes brought about by the pandemic and more by uncertainty concerning its long-term economic and social impact.","Heanoy, Shi, Brown","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.607976","20210125","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental well-being; stress; transition theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9882,""
"COVID-19 Infection Risk and Depressive Symptoms Among Young Adults During Quarantine: The Moderating Role of Grit and Social Support","Prior research has demonstrated that the adverse consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may go beyond its economic hardships and physical health concerns, having a significant influence on psychological distress for individuals under quarantine. Nevertheless, relatively little attention has been paid to exploring the risk and protective factors in the link between COVID-19 infection risk and psychological distress among young adults. Following a socioecological framework, the current study examines the moderating role of grit (perseverance and consistency) and social support in the association between COVID-19 infection risk and depressive symptoms. A sample of 1,251 young adults under home quarantine (62.6% female; <i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> = 20.92 years, <i>SD</i> = 1.47; age ranged from 18 to 25 years) was involved in this study, and they were asked to complete a set of self-reported questionnaires online. Results of a linear regression analysis exhibited that COVID-19 infection risk was positively associated with depressive symptoms in young adults in quarantine. Moreover, moderation analyses showed that this association was moderated by perseverance and social support. To be specific, for those reporting higher levels of social support, this linkage was not significantly positive; in contrast, for those reporting lower levels of social support, perseverance was a significant protective factor for depressive symptoms when young adults were exposed to a high infection risk of COVID-19. The current study suggests that greater social support is essential to helping young adults deal with possible negative emotions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, university-based counseling services should pay specific attention to those young adults with relatively insufficient social support resources and low levels of perseverance.","Hou, Yu, Lan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577942","20210125","coronavirus disease 2019 infection risk; depressive symptoms; grit; social support; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9883,""
"&quot;The Graying Minority&quot;: Lived Experiences and Psychosocial Challenges of Older Transgender Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic in India, A Qualitative Exploration","<b>Background:</b> The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat. Certain factors like age, an immunocompromised state, and social impoverishment, etc. can add to health vulnerabilities during this pandemic. One such group is older transgender adults, who often bear a combination of these risks. As the world is aging fast, their numbers have also been increasing. With this in mind, this study explores the lived experiences and psychosocial challenges of older transgender adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. <b>Methods:</b> A qualitative approach was used. Ten individuals with &quot;transgender&quot; identity above the age of 60 were recruited with consent through purposive sampling. In-depth interviews were conducted on the telephone using a pre-designed interview schedule. They were recorded, translated, and transcribed verbatim. Hasse's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method was used for analysis. Independent coding and respondent validation were used to ensure the rigor of data. <b>Results:</b> The super-arching categories (with themes) were marginalization (&quot;second&quot; priority, stigma, social disconnection), the dual burden of &quot;age&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; (ageism, othering, and psychosexual difficulties), and multi-faceted survival threats (physical, emotional, financial) during the pandemic. Social rituals, spirituality, hope, and acceptance of &quot;gender dissonance&quot; emerged as the main coping factors, whereas their unmet needs were social inclusion, awareness related to COVID-19, mental health care, and audience to their distress. <b>Conclusion:</b> The elderly gender minorities are at increased emotional and social risks during the ongoing pandemic, and their voices are mostly unheard. The need for policy implementation and community awareness about their social welfare is vital to improving their health and well-being.","Banerjee, Rao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.604472","20210125","COVID-19; coronavirus; gender minorities; lived experiences; older adults; pandemic; qualitative; transgender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9884,""
"Mental Distress and Human Rights Violations During COVID-19: A Rapid Review of the Evidence Informing Rights, Mental Health Needs, and Public Policy Around Vulnerable Populations","<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 prevention and mitigation efforts were abrupt and challenging for most countries with the protracted lockdown straining socioeconomic activities. Marginalized groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of the pandemic such as human rights abuses and violations which can lead to psychological distress. In this review, we focus on mental distress and disturbances that have emanated due to human rights restrictions and violations amidst the pandemic. We underscore how mental health is both directly impacted by the force of pandemic and by prevention and mitigation structures put in place to combat the disease. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a review of relevant studies examining human rights violations in COVID-19 response, with a focus on vulnerable populations, and its association with mental health and psychological well-being. We searched PubMed and Embase databases for studies between December 2019 to July 2020. Three reviewers evaluated the eligibility criteria and extracted data. <b>Results:</b> Twenty-four studies were included in the systematic inquiry reporting on distress due to human rights violations. Unanimously, the studies found vulnerable populations to be at a high risk for mental distress. Limited mobility rights disproportionately harmed psychiatric patients, low-income individuals, and minorities who were at higher risk for self-harm and worsening mental health. Healthcare workers suffered negative mental health consequences due to stigma and lack of personal protective equipment and stigma. Other vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, and refugees also experienced negative consequences. <b>Conclusions:</b> This review emphasizes the need to uphold human rights and address long term mental health needs of populations that have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. Countries can embed a proactive psychosocial response to medical management as well as in existing prevention strategies. International human rights guidelines are useful in this direction but an emphasis should be placed on strengthening rights informed psychosocial response with specific strategies to enhance mental health in the long-term. We underscore that various fundamental human rights are interdependent and therefore undermining one leads to a poor impact on the others. We strongly recommend global efforts toward focusing both on minimizing fatalities, protecting human rights, and promoting long term mental well-being.","Rahman, Ahmed, Moitra, Damschroder, Brownson, Chorpita, Idele, Gohar, Huang, Saxena, Lai, Peterson, Harper, McKay, Amugune, Esho, Ronen, Othieno, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.603875","20210125","LMICs (low and middle income countries); health care worker [non-MESH]; human rights; lockdown; mental and behavioral health; stigma and discrimination; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9885,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Anxiety, Depression, and Sleep Problems Among Caregivers of People Living With Neurocognitive Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> To estimate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems among caregivers of persons living with neurocognitive disorders (PLWND) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and investigate whether the COVID-19-related experiences were associated with the presence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. <b>Methods:</b> From March 1 to 31, 2020, 160 caregivers of PLWND participated in an online cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was administered to measure anxiety symptoms, and the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Questions on sleep duration and sleep quality enquired about sleep problems. Six items were used to explore the COVID-19-related experiences, including community-level infection contact and the level of exposure to media information. We computed the prevalence rate of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with these mental health problems. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence rate of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were 46.9%, 36.3%, and 9.4%. Approximately 55 participants (34.4%) presented with two or more mental health problems. Women had a higher risk of developing anxiety symptoms (OR, 5.284; 95% CI, 2.068-13.503; <i>p</i> = 0.001). Having a mental disorder (OR, 5.104; 95% CI, 1.522-17.114; <i>p</i> = 0.008) was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Caregivers who preferred to access positive information (OR, 0.215; 95% CI, 0.058-0.793; <i>p</i> = 0.021) was associated with decreased risk of sleep problems. <b>Conclusion:</b> Anxiety and depressive symptoms were common among caregivers of older adults with dementia or mild cognitive impairment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being female was an independent risk factor for experiencing anxiety symptoms. Preexisting mental disorders increased the risk of depressive symptoms among caregivers, while caregivers who prefer to access positive media information decreased sleep problems.","Li, Zhang, Zhang, Li, Ma, An, Chen, Liu, Kuang, Yu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.590343","20210125","COVID-19; anxiety; caregiver; depression; neurocognitive disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9886,""
"Mental Health During COVID-19: <i>Tam Giao</i> and Vietnam's Response","COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease and global health crisis with major psychological implications. Of particular focus are the effects it will have on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as being under-resourced poses many challenges. Vietnam, a country with an estimated population of 97.33 million people, which until 30 July, 2020, had 459 confirmed COVID-19 cases with no fatalities but as of November 4th had 35 deaths, can be viewed as a model LMIC for other countries struggling with COVID-19. Employing key tactics such as transparency and effective communication, Vietnam was able to foster strong cooperation between government and citizens, contributing to its success during COVID-19. Moreover, Vietnamese resilience, attributable, in part, to &quot;<i>tam giao,&quot; a coexistence of</i> religious and philosophical Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism through cultural additivity, provides a unique mindset that other countries can learn from to adapt and even build psychological resilience against COVID-19 pandemic's psychological outcomes. We suggest countries prioritize transparency and communication to mitigate stigmatization and psychological distress that can result from quarantine and other interventions while promoting resources that provide accurate scientific information and psychological aid to citizens. We believe that <i>Tam giao</i> could be repurposed to relieve inevitable contradictions between values and lifestyles in the context of this devastating global health crisis.","Small, Blanc","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589618","20210125","COVID-19; Vietnam; community solidarity; cultural additivity; tam giao","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9887,""
"Loneliness, Emotion Dysregulation, and Internalizing Symptoms During Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach","<b>Background:</b> Our study aimed to test the hypotheses that an increased level of loneliness experienced during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confinement was predictive of internalizing symptoms and that this pathway was mediated by emotion dysregulation levels. <b>Methods:</b> To reach this aim, we performed an online longitudinal survey recruiting 1,330 participants at Time 1 (at the beginning of the lockdown) and 308 participants at Time 2 (few days before the end of the lockdown).

"Gender differences in couples' division of childcare, work and mental health during COVID-19","The current COVID-19 crisis, with its associated school and daycare closures as well as social-distancing requirements, has the potential to magnify gender differences both in terms of childcare arrangements within the household and at work. We use data from a nationally representative sample of the United States from the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey to understand gender differences within households on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We study how fathers and mothers are coping with this crisis in terms of childcare provision, employment, working arrangements, and psychological distress levels. We find that women have carried a heavier load than men in the provision of childcare during the COVID-19 crisis, even while still working. Mothers' current working situations appear to have a limited influence on their provision of childcare. This division of childcare is, however, associated with a reduction in working hours and an increased probability of transitioning out of employment for working mothers. Finally, we observe a small but new gap in psychological distress that emerged between mothers and women without school-age children in the household in early April. This new gap appears to be driven by higher levels of psychological distress reported by mothers of elementary school-age and younger children.","Zamarro, Prados","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11150-020-09534-7","20210125","COVID-19; Childcare; Gender; Labor participation; Mental health; Working hours","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9889,""

This case series addresses cognition in post-COVID-19 patient by describing three patients in acute rehabilitation to inform a model of cognitive sequelae of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> Three English-speaking inpatients with severe symptoms and long-term intensive care unit (ICU) treatment are described. All patients had a premorbid history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and experienced delirium and hypoxemia when hospitalized. Patient 1 is a 62-year-old male with 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of education with additional history of obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes. Patient 2 is a 73-year-old female with 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of education with a premorbid medical history of alcohol use disorder and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patient 3 is a 75-year-old male with 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of education. No patients had premorbid psychiatric histories. <b>Results:</b> The three patients demonstrated deficits on formal neuropsychological testing, particularly with encoding and verbal fluency. Memory measures improved with a more structured story memory task compared to a less-structured verbal list-learning task, suggesting executive dysfunction impacted learning. None of the patients demonstrated rapid forgetting of information. Two patients endorsed new depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results suggest evidence for neurocognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 infection, particularly in encoding and verbal fluency.

The study findings offer implications for mental health professionals and officials responding to COVID-19 and provide insights into future planning and preparedness for disasters of this scale that may occur in future years.","Arslan, Allen","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1876892","20210125","Well-being; covid-19; meaningful life; positive psychology; psychological flexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9892,""
"Factors associated with Brazilian physical therapists' perception of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","This study aimed to evaluate the stress perception among Brazilian physical therapists (PTs) during COVID-19 pandemic and to identify which psychosocial demands, sociodemographic, professional and clinical factors do associate with the PTs' stress perception. This cross-sectional survey was based on a convenience sample of PTs, who answered a questionnaire about: 1) sociodemographic and professional characteristics, 2) clinical characteristics and information related to COVID-19, 3) psychosocial demands, and 4) 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Full responses were obtained from 417 PTs. The average PSS-10 score was 19.2 (95% CI 18.5 to 19.9), which was higher than in other Brazilians before COVID-19 and figured among the highest one observed in healthcare workers from different countries during COVID-19 pandemic. After multivariate analysis, PTs' perceived stress remained associated with female sex, younger age, previous diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorder, worsening in sleep patterns, large reduction in family income, housework, relationship with the partner, concern about close people/family members being infected by SARS-CoV-2, and loneliness.","Duarte, Daros Vieira, Cardozo Rocon, Andrade, Wittmer, Capellini, Soares, Paro","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1875133","20210125","COVID-19; mental health; pandemics; physical therapists; stress disorders; workerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9893,""
"Iranian psychosocial status and its determinant factors during the prevalence of COVID-19 disease","COVID-19 disease has quickly become a major threat and epidemic in the world. Many people are experiencing psychological disorders due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease. The present study aimed to investigate the psychosocial status of the Iranian citizens during the prevalence of COVID-19. One thousand one hundred and sixteen citizens of Rafsanjan city participated in the cross-sectional study from March 15 to 30, 2020. The data were collected using demographic and COVID-19 related-items, and Health General Questionnaire (GHQ -28). The results showed that 35% of the participant had mental health problems. All participants had social functioning disorder, while 22.8% had physical symptoms, 26.8 had anxiety symptoms and sleep disorders. In addition, the risk of psychosocial disorder was higher in females, those who were living in the city, earning less than 1 million, thinking of being at risk for infection with the coronavirus, and those whose most important concern about COVID-19 was death (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The results of the present study showed that all participants had social dysfunction. Therefore, health-care providers are suggested to evaluate the psychosocial consequences routinely, design and implement appropriate interventions to deal with these complications.","Hossini Rafsanjanipoor, Zakeri, Dehghan, Kahnooji, Sanji Rafsanjani, Ahmadinia, Zakeri","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1874438","20210125","COVID-19; epidemic; general health; health care; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9894,""

"Post-COVID syndrome and suicide risk","A significant number of COVID-19 patients continue to have symptoms related to COVID-19 after the acute phase of illness. This post-COVID condition is sometimes called &quot;post-COVID syndrome,&quot; &quot;long COVID,&quot; or &quot;post-acute COVID-19.&quot; Persistent psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 survivors such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic symptoms, and cognitive impairment may be related to psychological factors and neurobiological injury. COVID-19 related neurological symptoms including anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, headache and seizures may persist for a long time after the acute COVID-19 illness. Many COVID-19 survivors experience persistent physical symptoms such as cough, fatigue, dyspnea and pain after recovering from their initial illness. There is a high probability that symptoms of psychiatric, neurological and physical illnesses as well as inflammatory damage to the brain in individuals with post-COVID syndrome increase suicidal ideation and behavior in this patient population. COVID-19 survivors without post-COVID syndrome may also be at elevated suicide risk. Studies of suicidality in COVID-19 survivors are urgently needed and will be a new area of suicide research. An appropriate management of psychiatric, neurological and medical conditions may reduce suicide risk among COVID-19 survivors with or without post-COVID syndrome.","Sher","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcab007","20210124","COVID-19; depression; fatigue; neuroinflammation; post-COVID syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9896,""
"Psychologic distress and sleep quality among adults in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic","The sudden novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a negative effect on the mental health of the public. In this study, in relation to the pandemic, psychological distress, sleep quality and affecting factors in adults were examined. Using the convenience sampling method, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and questionnaires to determine psychological distress levels and sociodemographic characteristics were distributed online to 405 participants. The mean psychological distress score of the participants was 34.55Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8.07, while their mean sleep quality score was 6.39Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3.31. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.1%. The psychological distress scores were higher among the men than the women, married participants than single ones, those with children than those without children and those who were employed than those who were not. The sleep quality of the single participants and the participants with low education levels was poorer. The sleep quality of those who left work in the pandemic period was poorer than those who were working from home/office and those who were already not employed before the pandemic. The sleep quality of those not working in the field of health was better than healthcare professionals and those not working at all. The scores for psychological distress were positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with sleep quality levels. Our findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the psychological distress and sleep quality of adults. It is recommended for healthcare professionals to take the necessary psychosocial precautions.","Duran, Geyiktepe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110254","20210124","COVID-19; Psychological distress; Sleep disturbances; Sleep quality; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9897,""

"The changing landscape of friendship in the pandemic: Males, younger people, and less educated people experience more negative effects of the pandemic on their friendships","Friendships are important for social support and mental health, yet social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic have limited peopleâ€™s ability to interact with their friends during this difficult time. In August of 2020, we asked participants about changes in their friendships as a result of the pandemic - including changes in the quality of friendships and peopleâ€™s feelings about their friends - as part of a larger longitudinal study. We found that people who are younger, male, and less educated reported more negative effects on their friendships as a result of the pandemic, including feeling lonelier and less satisfied with their friends, while people with higher subjective socioeconomic status (SES) wanted to make more and shallower friends than those with lower subjective SES. We also found that feelings of stress, isolation and guilt around friendship are associated with greater COVID-related social risk taking, such as being motivated to make new friends and visit friends in person. Males, who reported more negative effects of the pandemic on their friendship than females, also reported a greater likelihood than females that they would attend large parties. These results show that the pandemic is affecting friendships differently across demographic groups and suggest that the negative impacts of COVID-19 on friendships might motivate some COVID-related social risk taking in order to try to maintain friendships or build new ones.","Jessica Daphne Ayers et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46004-EC6-FA4","20210126","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; risk management; covid-19; cooperation; friendship","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-26","",9899,""
