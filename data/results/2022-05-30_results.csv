"Mental health and COVID-19 in a general population cohort in Spain (COVICAT study)","Mental health conditions may affect outcome of COVID-19 disease, while exposure to stressors during the pandemic may impact mental health. The purpose of this study was to examine these factors in relation to ocurrence of depression and anxiety after the first outbreak in Spain. We contacted 9515 participants from a population-based cohort study in Catalonia between May and October 2020. We drew blood samples to establish infection to the virus. Pre-pandemic mental health conditions were confirmed through Electronic Health Registries. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess severe depression and anxiety post-pandemic. Exposure to proximal, financial and wider environment stressors during the lockdown were collected. We calculated Relative Risks (RR), adjusting for individual- and contextual covariates. Pre-pandemic mental health disorders were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection , but were associated with severity of COVID-19 disease. People with pre-existing mental health disorders showed higher prevalence of severe depression (25.4%) and anxiety (37.8%) than those without prior mental disorders (4.9% and 10.1%). Living alone was a strong predictor of severe depression among mental health patients (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). Among those without prior mental health disorders, post-lockdown depression and anxiety were associated with household interpersonal conflicts (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.6, 95% CI 2.1-3.1; RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.1, 95% CI 1.9-2.4) and financial instability (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.9; 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.2). The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown were associated with increased post-lockdown depression and anxiety.

"Association between chemosensory impairment with neuropsychiatric morbidity in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome: results from a multidisciplinary cohort study","Preliminary methodologically limited studies suggested that taste and smell known as chemosensory impairments and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated in post-COVID-19. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether chemosensory dysfunction and neuropsychiatric impairments in a well-characterized post-COVID-19 sample. This is a cohort study assessing adult patients hospitalized due to moderate or severe formsÃ‚Â of COVID-19 between March and August 2020. Baseline information includes several clinical and hospitalization data. Further evaluations were made using several different reliable instruments designed to assess taste and smell functions, parosmia, and neuropsychiatric disorders (using standardized psychiatric and cognitive measures). Out of 1800 eligible individuals, 701 volunteers were assessed on this study. After multivariate analysis, patients reporting parosmia had a worse perception of memory performance (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Moderate/severe hypogeusia was significantly associated with a worse performance on the word list memory task (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012); Concomitant moderate/severe olfactory and gustatory loss during the acute phase of COVID-19 was also significantly associated with episodic memory impairment (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006). We found a positive association between reported chemosensory (taste and olfaction) abnormalities and cognition dysfunction in post-COVID-19 patients. These findings may help us identify potential mechanisms linking these two neurobiological functions, and also support the speculation on a possible route through which SARS-CoV-2 may reach the central nervous system.","Damiano, Neto, Oliveira, MagalhÃƒÂ£es Santos, Alves, Guedes, Nitrini, de AraÃƒÂºjo, Oliveira, Brunoni, Voegels, Bento, Busatto, Miguel, Forlenza, de Rezende Pinna, Utiyama, Segurado, Perondi, Miethke-Morais, Montal, Harima, Fusco, Silva, Rocha, Marcilio, Rios, Kawano, de Jesus, Kallas, Carmo, Tanaka, de Souza, Marchini, Carvalho, Ferreira, Levin, Oliveira, GuimarÃƒÂ£es, Dos Santos LÃƒÂ¡zari, da Silva Duarte, Sabino, Magri, Barros-Filho, Francisco, Costa","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-022-01427-3","20220528","COVID-19; Cognition; Gustatory; Mental health; Olfactory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32054,""
"Neurological Sequelae of COVID-19","Though primarily a pulmonary disease, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus can generate devastating disease states that affect multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). The various neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 range in severity from mild symptoms such as headache, or myalgias to more severe symptoms such as stroke, psychosis, and anosmia. While some of the COVID-19 associated neurological complications are mild and reversible, a significant number of patients suffer from stroke. Studies have shown that COVID-19 infection triggers a wave of inflammatory cytokines that induce endothelial cell dysfunction and generate coagulopathy that increases the risk of stroke or thromboses. Inflammation of the endothelium following infection may also destabilize atherosclerotic plaque and induce thrombotic stroke. Although uncommon, there have also been reports of hemorrhagic stroke associated with COVID-19. The proposed mechanisms include a blood pressure increase caused by infection leading to a reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) levels that results in an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system ultimately manifesting inflammation and vasoconstriction. Coagulopathy, as demonstrated by elevated prothrombin time (PT), has also been posited as a factor contributing to hemorrhagics stroke in patients with COVID-19. Other neurological conditions associated with COVID-19 include encephalopathy, anosmia, encephalitis, psychosis, brain fog, headache, depression, and anxiety. Though there are several hypotheses reported in the literature, a unifying pathophysiological mechanism of many of these disorders remains unclear. Pulmonary dysfunction leading to poor oxygenation of the brain may explain encephalopathy and other disorders in COVID-19 patients. Alternatively, a direct invasion of the CNS by the virus or breach of the blood-brain barrier by the systemic cytokines released during infection may be responsible for these conditions. Notwithstanding, the relationship between the inflammatory cytokine levels and conditions such as depression and anxiety is contradictory and perhaps the social isolation during the pandemic may in part be a contributing factor to some of the reported CNS disorders. In this article, we review the current literature pertaining to some of the most significant and common neurological disorders such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, encephalopathy, encephalitis, brain fog, Long COVID, headache, Guillain-Barre syndrome, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in the setting of COVID-19. We summarize some of the most relevant literature to provide a better understanding of the mechanistic details regarding these disorders in order to help physicians monitor and treat patients for significant COVID-19 associated neurologic impairments. A literature review was carried out by the authors using PubMed with the search terms ""COVID-19"" and ""Neurology"", ""Neurological Manifestations"", ""Neuropsychiatric Manifestations"", ""Stroke"", ""Encephalopathy"", ""Headache"", ""Guillain-Barre syndrome"", ""Depression"", ""Anxiety"", ""Encephalitis"", ""Seizure"", ""Spasm"", and ""ICUAW"". Another search was carried out for ""Long-COVID"" and ""Post-Acute COVID-19"" and ""Neurological Manifestations"" or ""Neuropsychiatric Manifestations"". Articles such as case reports, case series, and cohort studies were included as references. No language restrictions were enforced. In the case of anxiety and depression, attempts were made to focus mainly on articles describing these conditions in infected patients. A total of 112 articles were reviewed. The incidence, clinical outcomes, and pathophysiology of selected neurological disorders are discussed below. Given the recent advent of this disease, the incidence of certain neurologic sequelae was not always available. Putative mechanisms for each condition in the setting of COVID-19 are outlined.","Ahmad, Feigen, Vazquez, Kobets, Altschul","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jin2103077","20220528","COVID-19; Guillain-Barre syndrome; Long COVID; anxiety; brain fog; cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; depression; encephalitis; encephalopathy; headache; hemorrhagic stroke; ischemic stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32055,""
"Early and Longitudinal Humoral Response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA BNT162b2 Vaccine in Healthcare Workers: Significance of BMI, Adipose Tissue and Muscle Mass on Long-Lasting Post-Vaccinal Immunity","This study aimed to investigate the early and longitudinal humoral response in Healthcare Workers (HCWs) after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and to assess the association between metabolic and anthropometric parameters and the humoral response after vaccination. The study included 243 fully vaccinated HCWs: 25.50% previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with prior history of COVID-19-PH) and 74.40%-uninfected, seronegative before the first vaccination (with no prior history of COVID-19-NPH). IgG antibodies were measured, and sera were collected: prior to the vaccination, 21 days after the first dose, and 14 days and 8 months after the second dose. 21 days after the first dose, 90.95% of individuals were seropositive; 14 days after the second dose, persistent immunity was observed in 99.18% HCWs, 8 months after complete vaccination-in 61.73%. Statistical analysis revealed that HCWs with PH had a greater chance of maintaining a humoral response beyond eight months after vaccination. Increased muscle mass, decreased fat mass, and younger age may positively affect long-term immunity. Smokers have a reduced chance of developing immunity compared to non-smokers. Fully vaccinated HCWs with PH are more likely to be seropositive than fully inoculated volunteers with NPH.","Golec, Fronczek, Zembala-John, Chrapiec, Konka, Wystyrk, Botor, Brzoza, Kasperczyk, BuÃ…â€šdak","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14050868","20220528","BNT162 vaccine; COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; IgG antibody; SARS-CoV-2; adipose tissue; body composition; health care professionals; healthcare workers; immunization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32056,""
"Parental Hesitancy towards the Established Childhood Vaccination Programmes in the COVID-19 Era: Assessing the Drivers of a Challenging Public Health Concern","(1) Background: Vaccine hesitancy remains a major public health concern. The reasons behind this attitude are complex and warrant careful consideration, especially in the context of the COVID-19 era. The purpose of this study was to estimate vaccine hesitancy towards the established childhood immunization programmes in a non-random sample of Greek parents and explore possible links with important drivers of this phenomenon. (2) Methods: An online self-administered questionnaire was used from October 2020 to April 2021 to collect socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health status data and evaluate knowledge, views, and attitudes of the Greek population on COVID-19 pandemic-related issues. Parents were further asked to complete the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) questionnaire. (3) Results: A total of 1095 parents participated in the study with a mean age of 50 years (SD 9.5 years). The hesitancy against the established childhood vaccinations was estimated at 8.9% (95% CI, 7.3-10.8%). Married status and higher education and income were negatively correlated with hesitancy, whereas positive correlations were found for stress and depressive symptoms and current smoking. Variables related to proper awareness, sound knowledge, and trust toward authorities regarding the COVID-19 pandemic were strongly associated with being less hesitant against the established childhood vaccination programmes. (4) Conclusion: The estimated parental hesitancy against the established childhood vaccination programmes is worrisome. Variables related to good awareness and knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic were strongly associated with being less hesitant against childhood vaccinations. Since controversy surrounding COVID-19 vaccinations may decrease parents' confidence in routine childhood vaccinations, appreciating the complex reasons behind vaccine hesitancy may inform public health policies to overcome barriers and increase vaccine acceptance.","Derdemezis, Markozannes, Rontogianni, Trigki, Kanellopoulou, Papamichail, Aretouli, Ntzani, Tsilidis","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10050814","20220528","COVID-19; Greece; childhood vaccination; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32057,""
"Adverse Mentions, Negative Sentiment, and Emotions in COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets and Their Association with Vaccination Uptake: Global Comparison of 192 Countries","<i>Background</i>: Many countries show low COVID-19 vaccination rates despite high levels of readiness and delivery of vaccines. The public's misperceptions, hesitancy, and negative emotions toward vaccines are psychological factors discouraging vaccination. At the individual level, studies have revealed negative perceptual/behavioral outcomes of COVID-19 information exposure via social media where misinformation and vaccine fear flood. <i>Objective</i>: This study extends research context to the global level and investigates social media discourse on the COVID-19 vaccine and its association with vaccination rates of 192 countries in the world. <i>Methods</i>: COVID-19 vaccine tweets were compared by country in terms of (1) the number per million Twitter users, (2) mentions of adverse events-death, side-effects, blood clots, (3) negative sentiment (vs. positive), and (4) fear, sadness, or anger emotions (vs. joy). Artificial intelligence (AI) was adopted to classify sentiment and emotions. Such tweets and covariates (COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates, GDP, population size and density, literacy rate, democracy index, institutional quality, human development index) were tested as predictors of vaccination rates in countries. <i>Results</i>: Over 21.3 million COVID-19 vaccine tweets posted between November 2020 and August 2021 worldwide were included in our analysis. The global average of COVID-19 vaccine tweets mentioning adverse events was 2% for 'death', 1.15% for 'side-effects', and 0.80% for 'blood clots'. Negative sentiment appeared 1.90 times more frequently than positive sentiment. Fear, anger, or sadness appeared 0.70 times less frequently than joy. The mention of 'side-effects' and fear/sadness/anger emotions appeared as significant predictors of vaccination rates, along with the human development index. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our findings indicate that global efforts to combat misinformation, address negative emotions, and promote positive languages surrounding COVID-19 vaccination on social media may help increase global vaccination uptakes.","Jun, Zain, Chen, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10050735","20220528","COVID-19; Twitter; adverse events; artificial intelligence (AI); country; emotions; global; infodemic; multinational; sentiment; side-effect; social media; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32058,""
"A Mental Health Chatbot with Cognitive Skills for Personalised Behavioural Activation and Remote Health Monitoring","Mental health issues are at the forefront of healthcare challenges facing contemporary human society. These issues are most prevalent among working-age people, impacting negatively on the individual, his/her family, workplace, community, and the economy. Conventional mental healthcare services, although highly effective, cannot be scaled up to address the increasing demand from affected individuals, as evidenced in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversational agents, or chatbots, are a recent technological innovation that has been successfully adapted for mental healthcare as a scalable platform of cross-platform smartphone applications that provides first-level support for such individuals. Despite this disposition, mental health chatbots in the extant literature and practice are limited in terms of the therapy provided and the level of personalisation. For instance, most chatbots extend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) into predefined conversational pathways that are generic and ineffective in recurrent use. In this paper, we postulate that Behavioural Activation (BA) therapy and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are more effectively materialised in a chatbot setting to provide recurrent emotional support, personalised assistance, and remote mental health monitoring. We present the design and development of our BA-based AI chatbot, followed by its participatory evaluation in a pilot study setting that confirmed its effectiveness in providing support for individuals with mental health issues.","Rathnayaka, Mills, Burnett, De Silva, Alahakoon, Gray","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22103653","20220528","artificial intelligence; behavioural activation; chatbot; conversational agents; emotional support; mental health monitoring; mental health support; personalised assistance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32059,""
"Psychological Health and Diabetes Self-Management among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes during COVID-19 in the Southwest of Saudi Arabia","<i>Background and objectives</i>: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia is high and rising steeply. However, the management of type 2 diabetic patients has largely employed a medical approach and ignored the self-care management approach. This observation has even been obscured further by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the psychological health of these patients. This study aimed to understand the effects of psychological health and DSM on type 2 diabetic patients in the Jazan region during COVID-19. <i>Materials and methods</i>: An analytical cross-sectional study was employed in this study. Participants were type 2 diabetic patients from the diabetic center at Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The Arabic-translated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were used to collect data. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. <i>Results</i>: Depression and anxiety were higher in females compared to males and were more reported by participants from urban compared to rural settings. Smoking and Khat chewing were inappropriate diabetic self-care management practices while exercising was appropriate. A negative correlation was observed between depression vs. health care utilization, and depression vs. diabetic self-care management. Anxiety results also showed similar findings to that of depression. Additionally, depression and anxiety were easily predicted by urban residence, and diabetic self-care management was predicted by exercise. <i>Conclusions</i>: Adequate self-care behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes is needed.

"A Single Session of Virtual Reality Improved Tiredness, Shortness of Breath, Anxiety, Depression and Well-Being in Hospitalized Individuals with COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial","In 2020, the world was surprised by the spread and mass contamination of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 produces symptoms ranging from a common cold to severe symptoms that can lead to death. Several strategies have been implemented to improve the well-being of patients during their hospitalization, and virtual reality (VR) has been used. However, whether patients hospitalized for COVID-19 can benefit from this intervention remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether VR contributes to the control of pain symptoms, the sensation of dyspnea, perception of well-being, anxiety, and depression in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was designed. Patients underwent a single session of VR and usual care. The experimental group (<i>n</i> = 22) received VR content to promote relaxation, distraction, and stress relief, whereas the control group (<i>n</i> = 22) received non-specific VR content. The experimental group reported a significant decrease in tiredness, shortness of breath, anxiety, and an increase in the feeling of well-being, whereas the control group showed improvement only in the tiredness and anxiety. VR is a resource that may improve the symptoms of tiredness, shortness of breath, anxiety, and depression in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

"Leveraging Tweets for Artificial Intelligence Driven Sentiment Analysis on the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a disastrous event that has elevated several psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. At the same time, social scientists and psychologists have gained significant interest in understanding the way people express emotions and sentiments at the time of pandemics. During the rise in COVID-19 cases with stricter lockdowns, people expressed their sentiments on social media. This offers a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. By exploiting user-generated content on social media such as Twitter, people's thoughts and sentiments can be examined, which aids in introducing health intervention policies and awareness campaigns. The recent developments of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL) models have exposed noteworthy performance in sentiment analysis. With this in mind, this paper presents a new sunflower optimization with deep-learning-driven sentiment analysis and classification (SFODLD-SAC) on COVID-19 tweets. The presented SFODLD-SAC model focuses on the identification of people's sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To accomplish this, the SFODLD-SAC model initially preprocesses the tweets in distinct ways such as stemming, removal of stopwords, usernames, link punctuations, and numerals. In addition, the TF-IDF model is applied for the useful extraction of features from the preprocessed data. Moreover, the cascaded recurrent neural network (CRNN) model is employed to analyze and classify sentiments. Finally, the SFO algorithm is utilized to optimally adjust the hyperparameters involved in the CRNN model. The design of the SFODLD-SAC technique with the inclusion of an SFO algorithm-based hyperparameter optimizer for analyzing people's sentiments on COVID-19 shows the novelty of this study. The simulation analysis of the SFODLD-SAC model is performed using a benchmark dataset from the Kaggle repository. Extensive, comparative results report the promising performance of the SFODLD-SAC model over recent state-of-the-art models with maximum accuracy of 99.65%.","Alkhaldi, Asiri, Mashraqi, Halawani, Abdel-Khalek, Mansour","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10050910","20220528","COVID-19; Twitter; deep learning; mental illness; natural language processing; sentiment analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32062,""
"Aging with Disability Symptoms and Ability to Participate in, and Satisfaction with, Social Participation among Persons Aged 45-64","Pain, fatigue, and depression, considered aging with disability (AwD) symptoms, are known to be substantially higher among middle-aged adults with long-term disability compared to their age peers. Participation has been recognized as an important component of health. This cohort survey study reports findings on the relationship between AwD symptoms and ability to participate in, and satisfaction with participation in, social roles and activities using PROMIS measures. Data were collected at three time points from individuals aged 45-64 with an average of two decades of disability duration and primarily living in the state of Missouri, USA. This study reports on Time 1 (T1) and Time 3 (T3), pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic declaration, respectively. Multiple regressions using both individual AwD symptoms and a composite measure demonstrated that having more pain, fatigue, and depression was associated with worse participation outcomes. Lower physical function scores were also related to lower participation scores, as was being female and living with others, and having more income reduced participation. Better physical health and identifying as African American/Black were associated with higher participation scores. Our findings suggest that AwD symptoms, along with other sociodemographic and health factors, play a substantial role in the social participation outcomes for persons aging with disability and remain consistent over time.","Putnam, Morgan, Heeb, Yan, Chen, Stark","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10050903","20220528","aging; disability; social participation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32063,""
"Increased Safety Behavior and COVID-19-Related Fear in Adults with Cystic Fibrosis during the Pandemic","People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) face great challenges during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent research found equal levels of distress in pwCF and healthy controls (HC). The current study aimed to investigate the mental health burden and safety behavior in pwCF. Sixty-nine adult pwCF and sixty-nine propensity-score-matched HC participated in this study. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire assessing distress, generalized anxiety, depressive symptoms, COVID-19-related variables, self-reported adherent safety behavior (ASB), and dysfunctional safety behavior (DSB). PwCF showed equal amounts of distress (<i>W</i> = 2481.0, <i>p</i> = 0.669), depressive symptoms (<i>W</i> = 2632.5, <i>p</i> = 0.268), and generalized anxiety symptoms (<i>W</i> = 2515.5, <i>p</i> = 0.565) compared to the HC. COVID-19-related fear (<i>W</i> = 1872.0, <i>p</i> = 0.028), ASB (<i>W</i> = 1630.0, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and DSB (<i>W</i> = 1498.5, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) were significantly elevated in pwCF. The pwCF estimated that the probability of suffering from symptoms (<i>W</i> = 954.5, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), experiencing a severe course (<i>W</i> = 806.5, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), or dying (<i>W</i> = 1079.0, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) from COVID-19 is significantly higher than that of the HC.

This cross-sectional descriptive study recruited a nationally representative, non-probability sample of parents or guardians (<i>n</i> = 2100) of children attending grades K-12 in the United States (U.S.) through a 58-item web-based survey. The univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical tests were used to analyze the data. The mean scores of parental Coronavirus anxiety and Coronavirus obsession were significantly different between race/ethnic groups of parents. Parents with children going to private schools had significantly higher mean scores for Coronavirus anxiety and obsession compared to parents whose children are attending public schools. Nearly 55% of parental Coronavirus anxiety was explained by the generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, child's vulnerability to infection, and school type of the child. Similarly, 52% of parental Coronavirus obsession was explained by the generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, child's vulnerability to infection, and social phobia of the children. The COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on psychological well-being of parents and their school-going children. Findings of this study will inform policy makers in developing targeted interventions to address unique needs of families with school-going children.","Batra, Pharr, Terry, Labus","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10050775","20220528","COVID-19; K-12; coronavirus anxiety; coronavirus obsession; psychosocial impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32065,""
"Effect of Working from Home on the Association between Job Demands and Psychological Distress","Limited information is available regarding the association between workplace psychosocial factors and general mental health status among workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This study examined how working from home affected the association between job demands and psychological distress (PD). A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in December 2020 (N = 27,036). The dependent variable (PD) was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Job demands were assessed using the Job Content Questionnaire. Working from home was determined by participants' responses to the question, ""Do you currently work from home?"" We used a two-level regression analysis adjusted for prefecture. Each individual-level variable at Level 1 was nested into each prefecture at Level 2, stratified by working from home or not. Overall, 21.3% of participants worked from home. The interaction between working from home and job demands was significant. Job demands were positively associated with PD. The stratified analysis indicated that the associations were weaker among employees who worked from home compared with those among employees who did not. The association between job demands and PD may be weakened by working from home.","Eguchi, Inoue, Hino, Tsuji, Tateishi, Ikegami, Nagata, Matsugaki, Fujino, On Behalf Of The CORoNaWork Project","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106287","20220528","COVID-19 pandemic; job demandÃ¢â‚¬â€œresource model; psychological distress; psychosocial factors; work from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32066,""
"Experiences, Emotions, and Health Consequences among COVID-19 Survivors after Intensive Care Unit Hospitalization","Literature suggested that COVID-19 patients experienced hospitalization as a physically and psychologically stressful event, with the risk to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms. The study aimed to understand psychological experiences of COVID-19 survivors with severe complications during and after ICU hospitalization, and any relevant health consequences. From October 2020 to January 2021, a qualitative study was conducted in Italy via semi-structured interviews by phone or video call addressed to COVID-19 survivors, randomly enrolled among people who released their stories publicly on newspapers, television, or social media. Fifteen individuals (three women and twelve men with average age of 56.4 years) were interviewed. Four main themes emerged: (i) emotion of fear; (ii) isolation and loneliness; (iii) unawareness about the gravity of the situation as a protective factor; (iv) ""Long COVID"" as consequences of the disease on physical and psychological health. During hospitalization, 66.7% of participants had mild or moderate values of anxiety and depression. After discharge, 86.7% moved to normal values. The results suggest that long-COVID is an important problem to manage to improve patients' quality of life. It is essential to guarantee a holistic take in charge starting before the discharge and continuing care after discharge in the community where they live.","Piras, Piazza, Piccolo, Azara, Piana, Finco, Galletta","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106263","20220528","COVID-19; emotions; health consequences; hospitalization; intensive care unit; long COVID; psychological experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32067,""
"""Compared to COVID, HIV Is Nothing"": Exploring How Onshore East Asian and Sub-Saharan African International Students in Sydney Navigate COVID-19 versus BBVs/STIs Risk Spectrum","<i>Background</i>: While a large body of evidence indicates changes in alcohol and other drug use among young people as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a lack of evidence around changes in sexual practices and how the pandemic may be impacting the potential spread of blood-borne viruses and sexually transmissible infections (BBVs/STIs). Most of what we know about sex during COVID-19 lockdowns is largely based on solitary sexual practices, which may not answer the critical question around how the pandemic may be shaping sexual practices among young people. Against this backdrop, this study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic may be shaping BBVs/STIs risk and protective practices among a sample of onshore African and Asian international students in Sydney, Australia. <i>Methods</i>: This phenomenological qualitative study involved semi-structured telephone and face-to-face interviews with 16 international university students in Sydney, between September 2020-March 2021. Generated data were coded using NVivo and analysis was guided by reflexive thematic analysis. <i>Results</i>: Participants reported elevated mental health distress because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some participants reported engaging in casual sexual hook-ups as a strategy to mitigate the mental health distress they were experiencing. Some of these sexual hook-ups were condomless partly because COVID-related disruptions impacted condom accessibility. Additionally, the preventive practices of some participants who were sexually active during the lockdowns were focused on preventing COVID-19, while the risk of BBVs/STIs were downplayed. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study indicates a need for a comprehensive public health response to the evolving and near-endemic COVID-19 situation. Such a comprehensive approach should focus on empowering young people to prevent both SARS-CoV-2 and BBVs/STIs.","Okeke","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106264","20220528","HIV; decision making; mental health; pandemic; public health response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32068,""
"Examining Anxiety, Sleep Quality, and Physical Activity as Predictors of Depression among University Students from Saudi Arabia during the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Conducted during the second wave of the pandemic, this cross-sectional study examined the link between sleep quality, physical activity, exposure, and the impact of COVID-19 as predictors of mental health in Saudi undergraduate students. A convenience sample of 207 participants were recruited, 89% of whom were females and 94% were single. The measures included questionnaires on the level of exposure and the perceived impact of COVID-19, a physical activity measure, GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PSQI. The results indicated that approximately 43% of participants exhibited moderate anxiety, and 50% were at risk of depression.

"Who Became Lonely during the COVID-19 Pandemic? An Investigation of the Socioeconomic Aspects of Loneliness in Japan","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted social and economic aspects of people's lives in different ways, causing them to experience different levels of loneliness. This study examines the extent of loneliness among men and women of various ages in Japan during the pandemic and attempts to determine the underlying causes. We used data from Hiroshima University's nationwide survey conducted before and during the pandemic in Japan. The sample consists of 3755 participants, of which 67% are men and 33% are women with an average age of 51 years (SD = 13.64). Using mean comparison tests and probit regression models, we show that loneliness is a common occurrence among the Japanese population and that a significant number of people became lonely for the first time during the pandemic. In general, loneliness was greater among younger respondents, but older people became lonelier during the pandemic. Simultaneously, we observed significant differences in loneliness across age and gender subsamples. Although depression and subjective health status contributed to loneliness, we found no single explanation for the loneliness experienced by people during the pandemic; rather, subsample analysis revealed that the causes of loneliness for each group differed. Nevertheless, we discovered that older people are at a higher risk of developing loneliness during the pandemic due to a variety of socioeconomic and behavioral factors. The findings of this study suggest that health authorities should not generalize cases of loneliness, but rather intervene individually in each group to avoid further complications.","Khan, Yuktadatta, Kadoya","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106242","20220528","COVID-19 pandemic; Japan; loneliness; socioeconomic attributes; subsample analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32070,""
"Impact of High-Intensity Interval Training on Body Composition and Depressive Symptoms in Adults under Home Confinement","The home confinement derived from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to drastic changes in people's habits. This situation has influenced their eating, rest, physical activity and socialization patterns, triggering changes in their mental stability. It was demonstrated that physical activity is beneficial for people's physical and mental health. By its moderate volume and requiring little space or material, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) could prove to be a valid alternative in a situation of confinement. The aim of the present study was to observe the impact of an 8-week HIIT protocol on the body composition and the depressive symptoms of adults in strict home confinement. A total of 21 healthy adults, both male and female, (35.4 Ã‚Â± 5.6 years old; 70.50 Ã‚Â± 12.1 kg; 171 Ã‚Â± 10 cm) were divided into an experimental group (EG, n = 11) who carried out an 8-week Tabata protocol, based upon calisthenic exercises with their own weight in their homes, and a control group (CG, n = 10) who did not carry out any systematic physical activity over the same period. Following the intervention, the EG experienced a significant reduction in percentage (t = 3.86, d = 0.57, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) and in kg (t = 4.62, d = 0.29, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) of body fat mass (BFM) and body fat mass index (BFMI) (t = 4.61, d = 0.31, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as a reduction in depressive symptoms (t = 6.48, d = 1.3, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05).

"Pet Presence Can Reduce Anxiety in the Elderly: The Italian Experience during COVID-19 Lockdown Assessed by an Electronic Survey","The lockdown imposed in Italy due to the COVID-19 outbreak required restrictions that severely limited individual freedom to protect the population and reduce virus diffusion. This situation psychologically challenged the entire Italian population but mostly the elderly. The ""Digital mental health approach"" employs digital tools to evaluate and prevent increasing mental health problems. ""Anonymous online electronic surveys"" are digital tools that assess rates of mental health outcomes (using for example self-assessment/awareness tools). Immediately at the beginning of restrictions, we designed an electronic survey a) to remotely investigate the psychological impact of the lockdown and b) to compare the anxiety between pet owners and not-pet owners. A total of 3905 subjects filled out the survey; we focused our study on 781 (20%) elderly subjects. Dividing elderly patients between pet-owners (<i>n</i> = 405) and not-pet owners (<i>n</i> = 376), the pet owners showed a Zung scale score significantly lower in respect to the not-pet owners. We observed that, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the pet presence could have a positive effect on anxiety in the elderly subject. These results: (A) encourage the use of mobile technologies for the assessment of psychological disorders that can be promptly employed in emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak; (B) highlight the positive effect of pet interaction to mitigate the psychological distress in elderly people.","Giansanti, Siotto, Parisi, Aprile","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106135","20220528","COVID-19; anxiety; elderly; mental-health; pet; social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32072,""
"Outdoor Activities Associated with Lower Odds of SARS-CoV-2 Acquisition: A Case-Control Study","Access to recreational physical activities, particularly in outdoor spaces, has been a crucial outlet for physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to understand how conducting these activities modulates the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this case-control study of unvaccinated individuals conducted in San Francisco, California, the odds of testing positive to SARS-CoV-2 were lower for those who conducted physical activity in outdoor locations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05, 0.40) in the two weeks prior to testing than for those who conducted no activity or indoor physical activity only. Individuals who visited outdoor parks, beaches, or playgrounds also had lower odds of testing positive to SARS-CoV-2 (aOR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.68) as compared with those who did not visit outdoor parks, beaches, or playgrounds.

"Are All Urban Parks Robust to the COVID-19 Pandemic? Focusing on Type, Functionality, and Accessibility","Many people visited urban parks during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the negative effects of lack of physical activity, social isolation, anxiety, and depression. It is unclear whether all parks are robust against the pandemic, helping people sustain healthy daily living through the diverse activities within them. Nevertheless, few studies have identified the specific relationship between park visits and the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate how physical features such as type, functionality, and access influenced daily visiting to parks during the pandemic, using mobile phone data at a micro level. This study first classified urban parks as point-type parks with an area of less than 1 ha, plane-type parks with 1 ha or more, and line-type parks with elongated shapes, while measuring accessibility to residential, employment, transportation, and auxiliary facilities within the park. The study employed the multi-level regression model with random intercept to investigate the effects of differing park visits, focusing on Goyang city, South Korea. Our analysis results identified that easy access from home was more important than the park size during the pandemic. If we look at the types of parks, the use of both plane- and point-type parks increased more than that of line-type parks. However, line-type parks near homes, along with shopping and sports facilities, were found to be more robust to the pandemic. These findings can be informative to provide specific guidelines to fulfill the enhanced role of parks in sustaining public health during an infectious disease pandemic that may strike again.","Sung, Kim, Oh, Lee, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106062","20220528","mobile phone data; multi-level regression model; park type; physical feature of urban park; urban park visit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32074,""
"Health-Promoting Quality of Life at Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A 12-Month Longitudinal Study on the Work-Related Sense of Coherence in Acute Care Healthcare Professionals","(1) Background: During a pandemic, the wellbeing of healthcare professionals is crucial. We investigated the long-term association of the Work-related Sense of Coherence (Work-SoC) and the evolution of psychological health symptoms of acute care healthcare professionals during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: This longitudinal observational study enrolled 520 multinational healthcare professionals, who completed an online survey every three months from April 2020 to April 2021. Mixed linear models examined the associations between Work-SOC and COVID-19-related anxiety, perceived vulnerability, depressiveness, and psychological trauma symptomatology. (3) Results: Healthcare professionals with a higher Work-SoC reported lower levels of COVID-19-related anxiety, perceived vulnerability, depressiveness, and psychological trauma symptomatology in April 2020 than healthcare professionals with an average or lower Work-SoC, but the levels increased to higher values in April 2021. Healthcare professionals with a lower Work-SoC reported higher levels of depressiveness and psychological trauma symptomatology in April 2020 but lower levels in April 2021. (4) Conclusions: Healthcare professionals with higher levels of Work-related Sense of Coherence might be protected against variations in psychological symptoms for about three months, but this protection seems to decrease as the pandemic continues, resulting in mental health deterioration.

"Determinants of Quality of Life in the COVID-19 Pandemic Situation among Persons Using Psychological Help at Various Stages of the Pandemic","This article presents the results of three surveys conducted during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 and in late June/early July 2020, when pandemic restrictions were in force. The surveys covered patients who had used psychological assistance before the pandemic. two were cross-sectional and one was longitudinal. The first survey involved 270 people (age: M = 29.59, SD = 10.74, women 79.3%), and the second one covered 117 subjects (age: M = 29.40, SD = 11.49, women 85.5%). The third, longitudinal, survey covered 83 subjects (age: M = 26.61, SD = 7.17, women 89.2%). In our research we used the Conservation of Resources Evaluation questionnaire, the abbreviated version of the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced, the WHO Quality of Life Scale, and a questionnaire for collecting sociodemographic information. Our analysis of the quality-of-life correlates in the two cross-sectional studies leads to an observation that for people using psychological help, the constant determinants of quality of life during a pandemic are high gain in resources and little loss of resources. In the first phase of the pandemic, active strategies were not linked to the sense of quality of life. This sense, however, was diminished by a number of negative strategies, such as denial, venting, substance use, restraint, and self-blame. After 3 months of the ongoing pandemic, perceived quality of life was positively correlated with strategies related to seeking instrumental support and active coping. this most likely points to a process of adapting to a difficult situation. The results of our longitudinal surveys demonstrate increasing escapism. Our attempt at explaining which factors determined the quality of life after 3 months of the ongoing pandemic showed that the crucial factors are: a sense of quality of life before the occurrence of the pandemic, changes in the distribution of resilience-oriented resources, changed frequency of using passive strategies, and active ways of coping-but only after 3 months into the pandemic. The results thus obtained can be used both in prevention and in work with persons affected by the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chwaszcz, Wiechetek, Bartczuk, Niewiadomska, WoÃ…â€ºko","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106023","20220528","COVID-19; coping; coronavirus; mental health; quality of life; resources; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32077,""
"Perfectionism, Resilience and Different Ways of Experiencing Sport during COVID-19 Confinement","The relationship between sports practice and physical and mental health became an important issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, where keeping fit and exercising was one of the best and most popular ways to cope with the confinement situation. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between perfectionism and resilient resources with psychological well-being, differentiating sports category, gender and experience in a sample of athletes during confinement in different countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. An incidental and cross-sectional random sampling method was designed (<i>n</i> = 583). The sample was analysed with three different instruments, evaluating perfectionism, resilience and psychological well-being patterns and comparing three groups with different levels of practice due to confinement (full reduction, moderate reduction and only access restrictions). Results show that both male and senior athletes were more organized, resistant to changes and focused their attention and efforts on their demands and potential. They were stimulated by obstacles that required more effort compared to U23, who reported higher concerns and lower organisational scores. Athletes who completely interrupted their sports dynamics showed higher indicators of perfectionism and performed worse in resilience and well-being. Despite this, age and the variability of the athletes' experiences proved to be relevant factors in an athlete's trajectory, and continued to represent a certain degree of balance in the face of COVID-19.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Bianco, Marques da Silva, GÃƒÂ³mez-LÃƒÂ³pez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19105994","20220528","adaptive perfectionism; athletes; culture; maladaptive perfectionism; pandemic; psychological well-being; resilient resources","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32078,""
"Maintaining School Foodservice Operations in Ohio during COVID-19: ""This [Was] Not the Time to Sit Back and Watch""","The COVID-19-related lockdowns led to school closures across the United States, cutting off critical resources for nutritious food.

Results indicate the majority of districts continued providing meals upon their closure in Spring 2020 (<i>n</i> = 182, 87.1%); fewer did so in Summer (<i>n</i> = 88, 42.1%) and Fall (<i>n</i> = 32, 15.3%). In Spring and Summer, most districts that offered meals functioned as 'open sites' (67.0% and 87.5%, respectively), not limiting food receipt to district-affiliated students. Most districts employed a pick-up system for food distribution (76-84% across seasons), though some used a combination of approaches or changed their approach within-season. Qualitatively, districts reported both ""successes"" (e.g., supporting students) and ""challenges"" (e.g., supply chain).

A path analysis was conducted on the data. A total of 842 people participated in the survey. The mean age of participants was 22 years (interquartile range = 6) and 24.0% were male. The final path model fitted the data well, with a comparative fit index of 0.998, a Tucker-Lewis index of 0.988, a standardized root mean square residual of 0.001, and a root mean square error of approximation of 0.072. In this study, there were significant path relationships between mood, exercise behavior, coping, and mental health. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the variables of mood, exercise behavior, and coping have both direct and indirect effects on mental health. The results also suggested that utilizing appropriate coping skills, exercise behavior, and positive mood can directly lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress, and that appropriate coping skills and positive mood can directly affect exercise behavior.","Yew, Kueh, Norsa'adah, Leong, Tang, Kuan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19105939","20220528","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; psychology; stress; structural equation modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32080,""
"Mental Health and Addiction Services Exclusive to LGBTQ2S+ during COVID-19: An Environmental Scan","Youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, 2-spirit, and of other identities (LGBTQ2S+) experience mental health disparities and higher rates of substance use when compared to their cisgender and heterosexual peers and yet also experience more barriers to access to services. The purpose of this paper is to determine the types of mental health and substance use programs and services exclusive to LGBTQ2S+ youth in Ontario during the pandemic. An environmental scan was conducted to identify existing programs and services in Ontario, Canada that offered exclusive mental health and addiction services to LGBTQ2S+ individuals aged 16-29, either by offering services to all or subgroups within the population. Organizations, services and programs were classified by the geographical distribution of services, populations served, types of programming or services, methods of service delivery, and program criteria. In total, 113 organizations and 240 programs and services were identified as providing mental health and substance use services exclusively to LGBTQ2S+ youth. Identified adaptations for the COVID-19 pandemic included cancelling in-person services, increasing online and telephone services, and expansion to province wide from local availability. The findings highlight the importance of offering services that provide culturally inclusive care for LGBTQ2S+ youth, and these results can also be used by policy makers to inform policies. In particular, there was a lack of culturally relevant clinical services for youth requiring a greater intensity of treatment.","Chaiton, Billington, Copeland, Grey, Abramovich","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19105919","20220528","COVID-19; LGBTQ; access to care; mental health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32081,""
"At the Peak of the Second Wave of COVID-19, Did Millennials Show Different Emotional Responses from Older Adults?","The COVID-19 pandemic disturbs mental health. Indeed, higher levels of negative emotions and anxiety, along with lower levels of positive emotions and well-being, have been highlighted. As a result, individuals need to regulate these psychological states in a context of uncertainty and daily restrictions (e.g., access to leisure activities, social contacts) or modifications of livelihood (e.g., working modalities). Overall, psychological reactions to the pandemic have been shown to differ based on one's age. The purpose of this research is to compare psychological reactions to the pandemic between Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Older Adults. The generation's prism seems relevant as members of specific generations are shaped (e.g., views of the world, the future) by their similar experiences. Ninety-four Millennials and 129 Older Adults, recruited in the general population, participated to an online survey assessing emotions, emotion regulation strategies, environmental satisfaction, and intolerance of uncertainty. Results show that Millennials experience higher levels of negative emotions along with higher levels of worry and rumination than Older Adults. Millennials also report a higher level of joy. Nonetheless, more Older Adults engage themselves in novel activities. Overall, findings confirm previous ones and indicate the need to offer effective clinicals tool to prevent mental health worsening.","Wagener, Stassart, Etienne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19105908","20220528","COVID-19; Millennials; emotion regulation strategies; emotions; environmental satisfaction; intolerance of uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32082,""
"Emotions, Stress and Coping among Healthcare Workers in a Reproductive Medicine Unit during the First and Second COVID-19 Lockdowns","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health has been well documented in the last two years; however, little is known regarding HCWs working in specific healthcare fields. During two subsequent periods of national lockdown in Italy (June-July 2020, T1, and November-December 2020, T2), a total sample of 47 HCWs working in a reproductive medicine hospital unit completed an ad hoc questionnaire for assessing emotional reactions to the pandemic, stress symptoms, and ways of coping. Moderate-high levels of anger and sadness were experienced by 65.9% and 68.1% of the HCWs, respectively, while moderate-high levels of anxiety and fear were experienced by 51.1% and 56.8%, respectively. Higher stress symptoms experienced by HCWs were hypervigilance, avoidance of thoughts and memories, and tiredness/low energy. At T2, levels of hypervigilance, irritability, intrusive thoughts, and detachment were higher than at T1, while avoidance of external triggers decreased. Moderate-high levels of anxiety resulted significantly associated with several symptoms of stress: irritability/fearfulness, depression/hopelessness, tiredness/low energy, problems with concentration, and intrusive thoughts. Regarding coping strategies, HCWs tended to adopt more problem-focused coping (e.g., contributing to improving a situation) and this tendency was higher at T2. Overall findings suggest a risk for the persistence of stress symptoms and, therefore, a risk for a chronic course, which might interfere with the global quality of mental health at work and the care provided to patients. Clinical implications highlight the relevance of implementing support programs for this category of HCWs focused on the elaboration of negative emotions and on fostering adaptive coping strategies.","Paterlini, Neri, Nicoli, Genova, Villani, Santi, Agostini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19105899","20220528","COVID-19 lockdown; coping; emotions; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological wellbeing; reproductive medicine; stress impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32083,""

In addition to the variables investigated in previous surveys (job changes due to the pandemic, justice of safety procedures, job stress, sleep quality, satisfaction, happiness, anxiety, depression, burnout, and intention to quit), the latest fourth wave (December 2021) study has evaluated discomfort in caring for anti-vax patients. A multivariate logistic regression model confirmed that high levels of occupational stress (distressed 75.8%) were associated with isolation, monotony, lack of time for meditation, and poor relationships with anti-vaccination patients. Compared to the first phase, there was a reduction in levels of insomnia and anxiety, but the percentage of intensivists manifesting symptoms of depression remained high (58.9%).

"Work-Related Stress among a Cohort of Italian Long-Term Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Study","Despite long-term care (LTC) workers having been identified as particularly subject to chronic stress, only a few studies evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress in this population. As far as the authors know, no studies have investigated the relationship between work-related stress and chronic stress in the LTC setting. This retrospective observational study aimed to assess the level of chronic stress in LTC workers, to identify some possible predictors and vulnerability factors, and to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on work-related stress. The study was based on the information gathered from two different questionnaires administered before and one year after the beginning of the pandemic, to a cohort of Italian LTC workers. We found that chronic stress was associated with lower resilience to stress scores (57.42 vs. 60.66) and with higher work-related stress scores (30.48 vs. 20.83). Interestingly, the overall level of work-related stress did not differ between the two questionnaires (27.84 vs. 29.08). However, the main components of the questionnaires changed; fatigue and burnout symptoms became more relevant after the pandemic. Results of this study suggests deepening knowledge of the components of stress to develop and implement effective stress mitigation interventions.","Conti, Russotto, Opizzi, Ratti, Nicolini, Vanhaecht, Panella","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19105874","20220528","COVID-19; healthcare workers mental health; long-term care; mental health; work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32085,""
"Non-Standard Employment and Unemployment during the COVID-19 Crisis: Economic and Health Findings from a Six-Country Survey Study","The COVID-19 crisis is a global event that has created and amplified social inequalities, including an already existing and steadily increasing problem of employment and income insecurity and erosion of workplace rights, affecting workers globally. The aim of this exploratory study was to review employment-related determinants of health and health protection during the pandemic, or more specifically, to examine several links between non-standard employment, unemployment, economic, health, and safety outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Canada, the United States, and Chile, based on an online survey conducted from November 2020 to June 2021. The study focused on both non-standard workers and unemployed workers and examined worker outcomes in the context of current type and duration of employment arrangements, as well as employment transitions triggered by the COVID-19 crisis. The results suggest that COVID-19-related changes in non-standard worker employment arrangements, or unemployment, are related to changes in work hours, income, and benefits, as well as the self-reported prevalence of suffering from severe to extreme anxiety or depression. The results also suggest a link between worker type, duration of employment arrangements, or unemployment, and the ability to cover regular expenses during the pandemic. Additionally, the findings indicate that the type and duration of employment arrangements are related to the provision of personal protective equipment or other COVID-19 protection measures. This study provides additional evidence that workers in non-standard employment and the unemployed have experienced numerous and complex adverse effects of the pandemic and require additional protection through tailored pandemic responses and recovery strategies.","Gunn, Vives, Zaupa, Hernando-Rodriguez, JuliÃƒÂ , Kvart, Lewchuk, Padrosa, Vos, Ahonen, Baron, Bosmans, Davis, DÃƒÂ­az, Matilla-Santander, Muntaner, O'Campo, Ãƒâ€“stergren, Vanroelen, Vignola, Bodin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19105865","20220528","atypical employment; health equity; income and employment insecurities; lack of workplace rights; mental health; occupational health and safety; pandemic responses and recovery strategies; poverty; social inequalities; transitions towards non-standard employment and unemployment; worker health and well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32086,""

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Youth with Chronic Pain and Their Parents: A Longitudinal Examination of Who Are Most at Risk","Chronic pain and mental illness in youth and parents are poised to reach new heights amidst the societal and healthcare impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence from natural disasters (i.e., hurricanes) suggests that a degree of personal impact and individual personality may moderate the effects of high stress events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on mental health. In a pre-existing cohort of 84 youth with chronic pain (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 14.39; 12-18 years; 67.8% female) and 90 parents (86.7% female), we examined changes in youth pain interference and youth and parent mental health (depression, anxiety) from before to during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the influence of personal impact of the pandemic (i.e., financial, familial, health, social, occupational, and educational domains) and individual personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, extroversion). Overall, youth reported significantly lower pain interference and anxiety as compared to pre-pandemic; however, those more personally impacted by the pandemic reported worsening pain interference and anxiety symptoms. Overall, parents reported greater depressive symptoms as compared to pre-pandemic; however, those more personally impacted by the pandemic reported increased anxiety symptoms. Personality traits (high neuroticism, and low conscientiousness and extroversion) predicted worsened pain and mental health, and exacerbated effects of COVID-19-related personal impact on youth and parent anxiety symptoms. Identifying risk and resilience profiles in youth and parents at high risk for worsening pain and mental health may better inform matching interventions to individual need.","Birnie, Kopala-Sibley, Pavlova, Nania, Bernier, Stinson, Noel","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9050745","20220528","COVID-19 pandemic; chronic pain; mental health; parents; personality; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32088,""
"Altered Ocular Surface Health Status and Tear Film Immune Profile Due to Prolonged Daily Mask Wear in Health Care Workers","Prolonged daily face mask wearing over several months might affect health of the ocular surface and is reported to be associated with complaints of discomfort and dry-eye-like symptoms. We studied the ocular surface clinical parameters, tear soluble factors and immune cell proportions in ophthalmologists practicing within similar environmental conditions (<i>n</i> = 17) at two time points: pre-face-mask period (Pre-FM; end of 2019) and post-face-mask-wearing period (Post-FM; during 2020 COVID-19 pandemic), with continuous (~8 h/day) mask wear. A significant increase in ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores without changes in tear breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer's test 1 (ST1) and objective scatter index (OSI) was observed Post-FM. Tear soluble factors (increased-IL-1ÃŽÂ², IL-33, IFNÃŽÂ², NGF, BDNF, LIF and TSLP; decreased-IL-12, IL-13, HGF and VEGF-A) and mucins (MUC5AC) were significantly altered Post-FM. Ex vivo, human donor and corneoscleral explant cultures under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> stress revealed that the molecular profile, particularly mucin expression, was similar to the Post-FM tear molecular profile, suggesting hypercapnia is a potential contributor to ocular surface discomfort. Among the immune cell subsets determined from ocular surface wash samples, significantly higher proportions of leukocytes and natural killer T cells were observed in Post-FM compared to Pre-FM. Therefore, it is important to note that the clinical parameters, tear film quality, tear molecular factors and immune cells profile observed in prolonged mask-wear-associated ocular surface discomfort were distinct from dry eye disease or other common ocular surface conditions. These observations are important for differential diagnosis as well as selection of appropriate ocular surface treatment in such subjects.","D'Souza, Vaidya, Nair, Shetty, Kumar, Bisht, Panigrahi, J, Khamar, Dickman, Agrawal, Mahajan, Sengupta, Nuijts, Sethu, Ghosh","https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10051160","20220528","COVID-19; hypercapnia; immune cells; mask; nociception; ocular surface discomfort; soluble factors; tear fluid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-30","",32089,""
"Reflections on the 2021 World Malaria Report and the future of malaria control","The World Malaria Report, released in December 2021, reflects the unique challenges currently facing the global malaria community. The report showed the devastating toll of malaria, with an estimated 627,000 people losing their lives to the disease in 2020. The improved methodological approach used for calculating cause of death for young children revealed a systematic underestimation of disease burden over the past two decades; and that Africa has an even greater malaria crisis than previously known. While countries were able to prevent the worst-case scenarios, the disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic revealed how weak health systems and inadequate financing can limit the capacity of the continent to address the malaria challenge. African countries also face a convergence of biological threats that could redefine malaria control, notably widespread pyrethroid resistance and emerging resistance to artemisinin. Despite these challenges, there is cause for optimism in lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, recent acceleration of cutting edge research and development, and new partnerships that encourage leadership from and ownership by affected countries. This article presents key insights from the 2021 World Malaria Report and reflections on the future trajectories: it was informed by an in-depth discussion with leading malaria experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative (PMI).

A descriptive observational cross-sectional study was conducted at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in Jeddah and Riyadh campuses. Data was collected from 770 participants using an online questionnaire, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. The majority of the participants (87.5%) considered governmental authorities as their main source of information, and therefore, they were up to date on the general information regarding COVID-19.

However, 50.9% of the participants expressed no signs of stress during this pandemic. An association was found between gender and mental health showing females to have higher tendencies to express signs of extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. An association was also found between parents' marital status and anxiety. Analysis revealed that participants with separated parents were the least among the participants to show no signs of anxiety, as well as reporting the highest numbers in the ""extremely severe"" anxiety category.

"An evaluation of Internet searches as a marker of trends in population mental health in the US","The absence of continuous, real-time mental health assessment has made it challenging to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health. We examined publicly available, anonymized, aggregated data on weekly trends in Google searches related to anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation from 2018 to 2020 in the US. We correlated these trends with (1) emergency department (ED) visits for mental health problems and suicide attempts, and (2) surveys of self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and mental health care use. Search queries related to anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation decreased sharply around March 2020, returning to pre-pandemic levels by summer 2020. Searches related to depression were correlated with the proportion of individuals reporting receiving therapy (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.73), taking medication (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.62) and having unmet mental healthcare needs (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.57) on US Census Household Pulse Survey and modestly correlated with rates of ED visits for mental health conditions.

"The effects of self-generated and other-generated eWOM in inoculating against misinformation","This study examines the effects of self-generated and other-generated electronic word-of-mouth communication (eWOM) in inoculating individuals against potential misinformation. A three-phase between-subject experiment (NÂ =Â 543) was conducted to compare the persuasive effects of inoculation messages combined with different eWOM content (self-generated, other-generated, and inoculation only) over two health topics (Covid-19 vaccine and e-cigarette). The results show that exposure to inoculation messages did not significantly increase resistance to misinformation. But inoculation messages combined with other-generated eWOM helped the participants develop more negative attitudes toward alternative smoking immediately after exposure to the inoculation stimuli. The participants who wrote eWOM after exposure to inoculation messages were more resistant to the attack of misinformation in Phase 3. Self-generated and other-generated eWOM did not significantly differ in their persuasive effects in any phases. The findings extend the literature on the effects of WOM in the inoculation process and offer theoretical implications over inoculation theory in online contexts.

Introduction Individuals with psychiatric disorders have been the focus of vigilance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this retrospective study was to estimate the influence of the living conditions of these people, on the evolution of their mood during the first lockdown in spring 2020 in France. Method A questionnaire was proposed to 86 patients with psychiatric illnesses followed in ambulatory care, in order to evaluate their living conditions, their psychological resources and their perception of the health crisis. Patients responded to scales designed to assess perceived changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms during confinement. Analyses of variance and comparison of means were performed in order to study the variables that were significantly explanatory on the evolution of the disorders. Results A majority of patients reported stability of anxiety and depression symptoms during confinement. Alterations in lifestyle, such as an increase in sleep disturbance and smoking, had an effect on anxiety or depression. Occupational activities such as self-care, sports or outings influenced symptomatology.
