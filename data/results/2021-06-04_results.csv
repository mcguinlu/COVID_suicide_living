"What most influences severity and death of COVID-19 patients in Brazil? Is it clinical, social, or demographic factors? An observational study","Objective: This study aimed to assess the space distribution and factors associated with the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and death in COVID-19 patients, based on routine register data; and to develop and validate a predictive model of the risk of death from COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, epidemiological study of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases, reported in the south region of the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, from March 2020 to February 2021. Data were obtained from the official reporting databases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health for influenza-like illness (ILI) (esus-VE, in Portuguese) and for patients hospitalized for SARS (SIVEP-Gripe). The space distribution of cases is described by 2D kernel density. To assess potential factors associated with the outcomes of interest, generalized linear and additive logistic models were adjusted. To evaluate the discriminatory power of each variable studied as well as the final model, C-statistic was used (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve). Moreover, a predictive model for risk of death was developed and validated with accuracy measurements in the development, internal and temporal (March and April 2021) validation samples. Results: A total of 16,061 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Morbidities associated with a higher risk of SARS were obesity (OR=25.32) and immunodepression (OR=12.15). Morbidities associated with a higher risk of death were renal disease (OR=11.8) and obesity (OR=8.49), and clinical and demographic data were more important than the territory per se. Based on the data, a calculator was developed to predict the risk of death from COVID-19, with 92.2% accuracy in the development sample, 92.3% in the internal validation sample, and 80.0% in the temporal validation sample. Conclusions: The risk factors for SARS and death in COVID-19 patients seeking health care, in order of relevance, were age, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors, considering each discriminatory power.","Ana Carolina Cintra Nunes Mafra; RÃ©gis Rodrigues Vieira; Camila Nascimento Monteiro; Denise de Fatima Barros Cavalcante; JoÃ£o Luiz Miraglia; Daiana Bonfim; Danielle Costa Palacio; Alessandra Cristina Ferreira Martins; Leticia Yamawaka de Almeida; JoÃ£o Peres Neto","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.03.21258128","20210603","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14301,""
"Exposure to nature and mental health outcomes during COVID-19 lockdown A comparison between Portugal and Spain","To control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, countries around the world implemented lockdowns with varying intensities. Lockdowns, however, have been associated with a deterioration of mental health, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, anger and anxiety. Exposure to nature might reduce stress and provide relaxation opportunities. Firstly, we aimed to determine which sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics were associated with changes in exposure to nature during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal and Spain. Secondly, we sought to estimate the associations of these changes with mental health, and test whether these associations differed according to sociodemographic characteristics and between the two countries, which experienced different restrictions and epidemiological situations. A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 27 and May 6, 2020, using an online questionnaire to measure changes in exposure to nature (including private green space and other greenery, views of nature from home and public natural spaces); sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics; stress levels (visual stress scale); psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire - 12 items) and somatization (somatization scale). Adjusted regression models were fitted to estimate associations. This study included 3157 participants (1638 from Portugal, 1519 from Spain). In Portugal, maintaining/increasing the use of public natural spaces during the lockdown was associated with lower levels of stress (adjusted beta -0.29; 95%CI -0.49, -0.08) and maintaining/increasing the frequency of viewing nature from home was associated with reduced psychological distress (0.27; -0.51, -0.03), somatization (-0.79; -1.39, -0.20), and stress levels (-0.48; -0.74, -0.23). In Spain, maintaining/increasing contact with private green space and greenery was associated with lower stress levels: for contact with indoor plants (-0.52; -0.96, -0.07) and for use of private community green spaces (-0.82; -1.61, -0.03). Exposure to nature was associated with better mental health outcomes during lockdowns, but the natural features associated with improved mental health differed between the two countries. Nature should be incorporated into urban planning interventions and housing design and exposure to nature should be promoted during lockdowns.","Ribeiro, Triguero-Mas, Jardim Santos, GÃƒÂ³mez-Nieto, Cole, Anguelovski, Silva, BarÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106664","20210603","Confinement; Green space; Mental health; Nature; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14302,""
"Using the Nurse Coaching Process to Support Bereaved Staff During the COVID-19 Crisis","Nurses are confronting a number of negative mental health consequences owing to high burdens of grief during COVID-19. Despite increased vaccination efforts and lower hospitalization and mortality rates, the long-term effects of mass bereavement are certain to impact nurses for years to come. The nurse coaching process is an evidence-based strategy that nurse leaders can use to assist staff in mitigating negative mental health outcomes associated with bereavement. The End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium brought together a team of palliative nursing experts early in the pandemic to create resources to support nurses across settings and promote nurse well-being. This article shares a timely resource for health systems and nursing administration that leverages the nurse coaching process to support bereaved staff in a safe and therapeutic environment.","Rosa, Levoy, Battista, Dahlin, Thaxton, Greer","https://doi.org/10.1097/NJH.0000000000000773","20210603","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14303,""
"The Roles of General Health and COVID-19 Proximity in App Contact-Tracing Usage: A Cross-Sectional Study of Attitudes","Contact tracing apps are considered useful means to monitor COVID-19 infections during off-peak stages of the pandemic. Their effectiveness is however dependent on the uptake of such COVID-19 apps. We examine the role of individuals' general health status in the willingness to participate in a COVID-19 tracing app, as well as the roles of socioeconomic characteristics and 'COVID-19 proximity.' We draw on survey data from the WageIndicator Foundation: the Living and Working in Coronavirus Times. The survey collects data on labor market status, as well as potential confounders of the relationship between general health and COVID-19 app usage, such as sociodemographics and regular smartphone usage. The survey also contains information that allow us to examine the role of 'COVID-19 proximity,' such as having contracted the virus, having observed COVID-19 cases among family members or colleagues, displaying depressive symptoms, and anxiety. We select data collected in Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands between ages 18 and 70 (N = 4,504). Logistic regressions are utilized to measure willingness to use a COVID-19 app. We find that the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 app usage varies dramatically between the four countries, although forms of not being employed (i.e.. recent job loss and inactivity) are consistently associated with lower willingness to use a tracing app (24.6%) as compared to employees (33.4%, P&lt;.001). Among selected COVID-19 proximity indicators, having a close family member being infected with COVID-19 is associated with higher contact tracing app usage (36.3% vs. 27.1%, P&lt;.001). Accounting for these proximity factors, and the country-variation therein, we find that having a poorer general health status is significantly associated with of a much higher likelihood of contact tracing app usage. That is, compared to a self-reported 'very good' health status (estimated probability of 29.6), a 'good' (+4.6%-points [1.2-8.1]) and 'fair or bad' (+6.3%-points [2.3-10.3]) health statuses yield markedly higher willingness to use a COVID-19 app. In so far public health policy is aimed at using smartphone contact tracing during off-peak periods in the pandemic, campaigns appealing to health benefits for oneself and that of family members may be most successful for increasing the COVID-19 tracing app uptake. Public health campaigns that rely on digital platforms would also benefit from taking seriously the country-specific distribution of privacy concerns.","Witteveen, Pedraza","https://doi.org/10.2196/27892","20210603","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14304,""
"Study protocol: a mixed methods study to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Portuguese and Swiss higher education students","Higher education students are particularly vulnerable to both everyday stressors and mental health problems. Public health emergencies may generate a range of unforeseen potential stressors for vulnerable individuals and communities. The current pandemic has apparently led to an increase in psychiatric symptoms among these students. This study will characterise the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among Portuguese and Swiss higher education students. This project will use a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design in Portugal and Switzerland, with two consecutive phases. During phase I, a quantitative study will assess the psychological responses of higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A convenience sampling method will be used for collecting information from students. The association between variables will be determined with univariable and multivariable analysis. During phase II, qualitative data will be collected in order to understand the determinants of psychological stress and the strategies adopted by students as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as identify their opinions and feelings about the teaching-learning process during quarantine. In this phase, participants will be selected using a maximum variation sampling method. Data from Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) will be coded and inductively analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Finally, quantitative and qualitative results will be merged during interpretation to provide complementary perspectives. This paper describes and discusses the protocol for this mixed-methods study, which will be completed in December 2021. This study was formally approved by the local ethics committee (CE/IPLEIRIA/22/2020) in Portugal, and authorized by the Swiss Association of Research Ethics Committees - Swissethics (Project ID: 2020-02889). This research can contribute to the development of teaching tools and methods that reinforce positive mental health strategies, hope and adaptive coping among students, and to the development of a class on mental health interventions in the context of catastrophic/traumatic events. This project will also help government stakeholders and health/education professionals safeguard the psychological well-being of students facing an expanding COVID-19 pandemic.

"The fast-motion research process about COVID-19 in children: a bibliometric review","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a great number of papers have been published in the pediatric field. We aimed to assess the worldwide research on COVID-19 in the pediatric field by bibliometric analysis, identifying publication trends and topic dissemination and showing the relevance of publishing authors, institutions and countries. Scopus database was comprehensively searched for all indexed documents published between January 1, 2020 and June 11, 2020, dealing with COVID-19 in pediatric age (0-18 years). A machine learning bibliometric methodology was applied to evaluate the total number of papers and citations, journal and publication types, the top productive institutions and countries and their scientific collaboration, the core keywords. A total of 2301 papers were retrieved, with an average of 4.8 citations per article. Out of them, 1078 (46.9%) were research articles, 436 (18.9%) reviews, 363 (15.8%) letters, 186 (8.1%) editorials, 7 (0.3%) were conference papers, and 231 (10%) others. The studies were published in 969 different journals, headed by The Lancet. The retrieved papers were published by a total of 12657 authors from 114 countries. The most productive countries were the USA, China, and Italy. The four main clusters of keywords were: pathogenesis and clinical characteristics (keyword occurrences n=2240), public health issues (n=352), mental health (n=82), and therapeutic aspects (n=70). In the pediatric field, a large number of articles were published in a limited period on COVID-19, testifying the rush to timely spread new findings on the topic. The leading authors, countries, and institutions evidently belong to the most seriously involved geographical areas. A focus on the pediatric population is often included in general articles, and the pediatric research about COVID-19 mainly focused on the clinical features, public health issues, and psychological impact of the disease.

"Mental Health and Perceived Usability of Digital Mental Health Tools among Essential Workers and Unemployed during COVID-19: A Remote Survey Study","COVID-19 has created serious mental health consequences for people who are designated as essential workers or have become unemployed as a result of the pandemic. Digital mental health tools have the potential to address this problem in a timely and efficient manner. The purpose of this study was to document the extent of digital mental health tool use (DMHT) by essential workers and those unemployed due to COVID-19, including asking participants to rate the usability and user burden of the DMHT they used most to cope. We also explored which tools and features of DMHTs were seen as necessary for managing stress during a pandemic through the design their own ideal DMHT. Two thousand people were recruited from an online research community (Prolific) and completed a one-time survey about mental health symptoms, digital mental health use and preferred digital mental health features. The final sample included 1,987 United States residents that identified as either an essential worker or someone who was unemployed due to COVID-19. Almost three-quarters of the sample (1479/1987, 74.8%) endorsed clinically significant emotional distress. Only 277/1957 (14.2%) of the sample used a DMHT to cope with stress associated with COVID-19. Of those who used DMHTs to cope with COVID-19, meditation apps were the most common (119/261, 45.6%). Usability was broadly in the acceptable range. Though, participants unemployed due to COVID-19 were less likely to report user burden with DMHTs than essential workers ( t198.1=-3.89, P&lt;.001). Individuals with emotional distress reported higher financial burden for their DMHT than non-distressed individuals (t69.0=-3.21, P=.01). When the sample was provided the option to build their own DMHT, the most desired features were a combination of mindfulness/meditation (1271/1987, 64.0%), information or education (1254/1987, 63.1%), distraction tools (1170/1987, 58.9%), symptom tracking for mood and sleep (1160/1987, 58.4%), link to mental health resources (1140/1987, 57.4%), and positive psychology (1131/1986, 56.9%). Subgroups by employment, distress, and previous DMHT use status had varied preferences. Of those who did not use a DMHT to cope with COVID-19, most indicated that they did not consider looking for such a tool to cope (1179/1710, 68.9%). Despite potential need for DMHTs, this study found that use of such tools remains like pre-pandemic levels. This study also found that regardless of level of distress or even past experience using an app to cope with COVID-19, it is possible to develop a COVID-19 coping app that would appeal to a majority of essential workers and unemployed persons.","Arean, Mata-Greve, Johnson, Pullmann, Griffith Fillipo, Comtois, Friedman","https://doi.org/10.2196/28360","20210603","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14307,""
"COVID-19 impacts on drinking and mental health in emerging adults: Longitudinal changes and moderation by economic disruption and sex","There are significant concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may have negative effects on substance use and mental health, but most studies to date are cross-sectional. In a sample of emerging adults, over a two-week period during the pandemic, the current study examined: (1) changes in drinking-related outcomes, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder and (2) differences in changes by sex and income loss. The intra-pandemic measures were compared to pre-pandemic measures. Participants were 473 emerging adults (M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 23.84; 41.7% male) in an existing longitudinal study on alcohol misuse who were assessed from June 17 to July 1, 2020, during acute public health restrictions in Ontario, Canada. These intra-pandemic data were matched to participant pre-pandemic reports, collected an average of 5 months earlier. Assessments included validated measures of drinking, alcohol-related consequences, and mental health indicators. Longitudinal analyses revealed significant decreases in heavy drinking and adverse alcohol consequences, with no moderation by sex or income loss, but with substantial heterogeneity in changes. Significant increases in continuous measures of depression and anxiety were present, both of which were moderated by sex. Females reported significantly larger increases in depression and anxiety. Income loss &gt;50% was significantly associated with increases in depression. During the initial phase of the pandemic, reductions in heavy drinking and alcohol consequences were present in this sample of emerging adults, perhaps due to restrictions on socializing. In contrast, there was an increase in internalizing symptoms , especially in females, highlighting disparities in the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Minhas, Belisario, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Roz, Halladay, Murphy, MacKillop","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14624","20210603","COVID-19; alcohol; anxiety; depression; emerging adults; sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14308,""
"[Experiences and perspectives of nursing home residents with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: aÃ‚Â qualitative study]","The COVID-19 pandemic requires extensive health protection interventions in order to prevent infections in the long-term care setting. These interventions impact residents' lives, including an increase in depressive symptoms and other negative concomitants. The study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of nursing home residents with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. In this study nine guideline-based interviews were conducted with residents. These were analyzed using the content-structured content analysis according to Kuckartz. Three main themes were identified: perceptions and emotions related to the pandemic, changes and limitations due to the interventions and wishes in terms of the pandemic. The residents reported both emotional distress and not being afraid of infection and its consequences. In addition, some respondents reported unpleasant restrictions, such as wearing masks. In some cases their usefulness was critically questioned. Furthermore, various wishes of the residents in relation to the pandemic, such as leaving the nursing home, were identified. The study showed complex perceptions, changes, and wishes due to the pandemic and its interventions. Therefore, an individual approach to residents with depressive symptoms is necessary to avoid an increase in mental health problems. Against this background, there is aÃ‚Â need for participatory implementation of health protection measures for the particularly vulnerable group of nursing home residents.

"COVID-19: Patient care after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit","The Ibn Rochd CHU is a tertiary care structure that provides care for the most severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in intensive care. The objective of study is to describe the complementary medical and psychological care of patients with COVID-19 in the endocrinology department after a stay in intensive care. This is a descriptive observational study of patients transferred from the intensive care unit to the endocrinology service following a COVID-19 infection during the period from 17 April 2020 to May 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics of the patients and complications related to COVID-19 infection were studied; a nutritional assessment using the MNA nutritional status assessment questionnaire; psychological assessment using quality of life questionnaires (Hamilton depression and anxiety, HAD, SF36, PCLS); a treatment satisfaction questionnaire (TQCMII), and an assessment of patient autonomy by the ADL score. Our study included 41 patients with an average age of 55 years (19-85 years), a sex ratio M/F of 1.05, 43.9% were diabetic, 34.1% hypertensive, 4.9% asthmatic and 5% obese, 51.2% were severe and critical cases. The average ICU stay is 8.42 days, requiring intubation in 12.2% of cases. All patients were treated with the Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc and corticosteroid protocol, 14.6% had undernutrition and 65.9% had a risk of undernutrition.

"Extrapulmonary features of post-COVID-19 patients: muscle function, physical activity, mood, and sleep quality","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a wide range of clinical manifestations, even if mild disease severity. It has been known that pulmonary function is affected by COVID-19 during infection and mid-to-long term. However, there is inadequate evidence about extrapulmonary features in post-COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate extrapulmonary features in post-COVID-19 patients who recovered from mild and moderate disease severity in the mid-term. This cross-sectional study was carried out after at least 12Ã‚Â weeks from the COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was defined using criteria for clinical severity of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The peripheral muscle strength was measured using the dynamometer. Physical performance was assessed with five times sit-to-stand and 4-m gait speed. Physical activity level (PAL), mood, and sleep quality were assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. A total of 48 participants with post-COVID-19 (39.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.9Ã‚Â years, 54.2% women) were included in the study. Handgrip and quadriceps weakness was observed in 39.6% and 35.4% of the participants, respectively. PAL was low in 39.6%, moderate in 33.3%, and high in 27.1% of the participants. Anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality were observed in 33.3%, 29.2%, and 50% of the participants, respectively. Extrapulmonary features are adversely affected in a substantial proportion of post-COVID-19 patients who recovered from mild and moderate disease severity in the mid-term. Comprehensive assessment and appropriate intervention strategies should also be considered for non-severe post-COVID-19 patients.","Tanriverdi, Savci, Kahraman, Ozpelit","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02667-3","20210603","COVID-19; Mood; Muscle strength; Physical activity; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14313,""
"Development of a Conceptual Framework for Severe Self-Neglect (SN) by Modifying the CREST Model for Self-Neglect","Self-neglect is an inability or refusal to meet one's own basic needs as accepted by societal norms and is the most common report received by state agencies charged with investigating abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable adults. Self-neglect is often seen in addition to one or multiple conditions of frailty, mild to severe dementia, poor sleep and depression. While awareness of elder self-neglect as a public health condition and intervention has significantly risen in the past decade as evidenced by the increasing amount of literature available, research on self-neglect still lacks comprehensiveness and clarity since its inception to the medical literature in the late 1960s. With the burgeoning of the older adult population, commonness of self-neglect will most likely increase as the current incidence rate represents only the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; theory given that most cases are unreported. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the incidence of self-neglect in aged populations and the need for the use of intervention tools for aging adults and geriatric patients living alone, many of which may include in-home artificial intelligence systems. Despite this, little research has been conducted on aspects of self-neglect other than definition and identification. Substantial further study of this disorder's etiology, educating society on early detection, and conceivably preventing this syndrome altogether or at least halting progression and abating its severity is needed. The purpose of this research is to provide a definition of severe self-neglect, identify key concepts related to self-neglect, comprehensively describe this syndrome, present a conceptual framework and analyze the model for its usefulness, generalizability, parsimony, and testability.","Pickens, Daniel, Jones, Jefferson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.654627","20210603","artificial intelligence; cognition; geriatrics; self-neglect; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14314,""
"Prevalence and Related Factors of Depression, Anxiety, Acute Stress, and Insomnia Symptoms Among Medical Staffs Experiencing the Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic in Xinjiang, China","The prevalence and related factors of mental health impact among medical staffs who experienced the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in China is unknown. Therefore, this survey was conducted to investigate the prevalence and related factors of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms in medical staffs in Kashi, Xinjiang, China during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among medical staffs working in First People's Hospital of Kashi, Xinjiang. The questionnaire collected demographic data and self-design questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Impact of Events Scale-6, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory-15, and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire were used to measure psychological symptoms or characteristics. Binary logistic regression was carried out to examine the associations between socio-demographic factors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. In total, data from 123 participants were finally included, among which the prevalence rate of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms is 60.2, 49.6, 43.1, and 41.1%, respectively. The regression model revealed that minority ethnicity, being worried about infection, spending more time on following pandemic information, and neurotic personality were positively associated with the mental health symptoms, while extraversion personality, higher education level, and better social support were negatively associated. In our study, the prevalence of mental health impact was high among medical staffs in Kashi, China who experienced the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several factors were found to be associated with mental health conditions. These findings could help identify medical staffs at risk for mental health problems and be helpful for making precise mental health intervention policies during the resurgence. Our study may pave way for more research into Xinjiang during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Guo, Liu, Aizezi, Zeng, Sidike, Abliz, Kudireti, Xie, Taineikuli, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.671400","20210603","COVID-19; medical staff; mental health; pandemic; resurgence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14315,""
"Cognitive and Emotional Disturbances Due to COVID-19: An Exploratory Study in the Rehabilitation Setting","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) can cause neurological, psychiatric, psychological, and psychosocial impairments. Literature regarding cognitive impact of COVID-19 is still limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive deficits and emotional distress among COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients who required functional rehabilitation. Specifically, this study explored and compared cognitive and psychological status of patients in the subacute phase of the disease (COVID-19 group) and patients in the postillness period (post-COVID-19 group). Forty patients admitted to rehabilitation units were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups according to the phase of the disease: (a) COVID-19 group (<i>n</i> = 20) and (b) post-COVID-19 group (<i>n</i> = 20). All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A larger part of the COVID group showed neuropsychological deficits in the total MMSE (35%) compared to the post-COVID group (5%), whereas the majority of both groups (75-70%) reported cognitive impairments in the total MoCA. The post-COVID group reported significantly higher score in MMSE subtests of language (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and in MoCA subtests of executive functions (<i>p</i> = 0.05), language (<i>p</i> = 0.01), and abstraction (<i>p</i> = 0.02) compared to the COVID group. Regarding emotional disturbances, ~40% of patients presented with mild to moderate depression (57.9-60%). The post-COVID-19 group reported significantly higher levels of distress at the IES-R compared to the COVID group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings highlight the gravity of neuropsychological and psychological symptoms that can be induced by COVID-19 infection and the need for tailored rehabilitation, including cognitive training and psychological support.","Pistarini, Fiabane, Houdayer, Vassallo, Manera, Alemanno","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.643646","20210603","COVID-19; cognitive function; depression; pandemic; rehabilitation; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14316,""
"Identifying Variables That Predict Depression Following the General Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to define the psychological markers for future development of depression symptoms following the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on previous studies, we focused on loneliness, intolerance of uncertainty and emotion estimation biases as potential predictors of elevated depression levels. During the general lockdown in April 2020, 551 participants reported their psychological health by means of various online questionnaires and an implicit task. Out of these participants, 129 took part in a second phase in June 2020. Subjective loneliness during the lockdown rather than objective isolation was the strongest predictor of symptoms of depression 5 weeks later. Younger age and health related worry also predicted higher non-clinical levels of depression and emotional distress. The results support the diathesis-stress model, which posits that a combination of preexisting vulnerabilities along with stressors such as negative life events are among the factors affecting the development of psychopathology. Moreover, our results correspond with those of previous studies conducted worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, these findings call for focusing on psychological factors, especially among younger people, to identify individuals at risk for future development of depression and to promote new strategies for prevention.","Gozansky, Moscona, Okon-Singer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.680768","20210603","COVID-19; depression; emotion evaluation bias; intolerance of uncertainty; lockdown; loneliness; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14317,""
"Mental Health, Well-Being, and Psychological Flexibility in the Stressful Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study investigated the relationships between selected emotional aspects of mental ill-health (depression, anxiety, and stress, DASS) and mental well-health (well-being) experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical model of the study was based on Martin Seligman's positive psychology and PERMA theory and Paul Wong's Existential Positive Psychology 2.0 Theory, which postulates that negative experiences contribute to well-being and personal growth. The static approach was complemented by exploring the mediating role of psychological flexibility (defined as acceptance and action in the current situation) in the relationship between negative emotions and well-being. The data were collected during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from 277 participants (221 women), aged <i>M</i> = 33.83, SD = 12.77. The results confirmed that negative emotions correlated negatively with various domains of well-being (PERM), except for accomplishment (completing tasks and fulfill daily responsibilities). Moreover, negative emotions were related to the general well-being through psychological flexibility in that higher depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with lower psychological flexibility, which decreased general well-being. Finally, negative emotions were shown to be beneficial, having an adaptive effect that allows individuals to maintain their ability to cope with the situation, reach goals, and fulfill daily duties and responsibilities despite critical, stressful situation (like the COVID-19 pandemic) that limit their psychological flexibility. This observation confirmed the positive potential of negative aspects of life postulated within Existential Positive Psychology.","WÃ„â€¦sowicz, Mizak, Krawiec, BiaÃ…â€šaszek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647975","20210603","anxiety; depression; flourishing; mental health; psychological flexibility; stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14318,""
"Covid-19, Lockdown and Self-Isolation: Evaluation of Deliberate Self-Harm Admissions","<b>Background:</b> COVID 19 is still presenting a clear and dynamic global threat. The United Kingdom remains one of the hardest hit countries from the pandemic. In January 2021 parliament announced that the UK will be entering a full national lockdown. This paper explores what effect lockdown measures had on rates of deliberate self-harm presentations to one NHS trust in Manchester UK. <b>Methods:</b> This paper compared the number of cases of deliberate self-harm which presented to the emergency department of Manchester Royal Infirmary for March-May in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This was achieved by utilising coding from emergency department data and reviewing hospital records surrounding each case. <b>Results:</b> 2018 recorded a total of 101 admissions as a result of DSH with all causes admissions of 8,514 making the proportions of admissions due to self-harm 1.19%. In 2019, 9,038 patients were admitted, of these, 130 (1.44%) were identified as DSH. In 2020 the total number of admissions fell to 5,676 with 118 admitted due to self-harm, representing 2.08% of admissions. The absolute number of admissions remained stable however the proportion of admissions due to self-harm was significantly higher in 2020 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Other significant findings include a higher proportion of male admissions compared to females in 2020 (58.5%) and a decrease in the normal of cases relating to paracetamol overdose in 2020. <b>Discussion:</b> The findings demonstrated by this study do not indicate that lockdown is an absolute risk for DSH behaviours however it does illustrate the stable nature of these cases despite and dramatic decline in all cause admissions. The rate of increase of deliberate self-harm accelerated significantly between March and May in 2020. Steps must be taken to avoid a similar situation following the 2021 lockdown and beyond - focus on improving access to certain virtual services may help to achieve this goal.","Shields, Bernard, Mirza, Reeves, Wells, Heagerty","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.662885","20210603","COVID-19; deliberate self harm; lockdown; mental health; self harm; stress; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14319,""
"Psychological Consequence of the Corona Virus Disease Pandemic in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is impacting the mental health of the population, but data on its impact in developing countries are lacking. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychological aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population of Kinshasa.

Socio-demographic data, and data concerning COVID-19 and its impact on mental health, were studied. Anxiety and depression were studied using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The two genders were represented in equal proportions; the patients had a mean age of 40.4Ã‚Â±17.2 years with a high frequency of patients aged over 50 years. All had agreed to observe social distancing, but only 36.8% had accepted isolation. Using the HADS, 47.4% had a doubtful anxiety state and 23.7% had a definite anxiety state; 36.8% had a doubtful depressive state and 25% had a definite depressive state. Old age (Ã¢â€°Â¥50 years), female gender, lack of occupation, and isolation were independent determinants associated with anxiety and depression. The frequency of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic was high.

"The Traumatic Experience of Clinical Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Which Factors are Related to Post-Traumatic Growth?","Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a positive result of fighting against traumatic events. This study aimed to investigate the current status of PTG of clinical nurses and analyze its influencing factors. A total of 1790 nurses participated in the study and completed the questionnaire. Demographic data and related scales of PTG, post-traumatic stress disorder, coping style, social support, and self-efficacy were collected online. Through univariate analysis and multiple linear regression analysis, the related influencing factors were studied. The total score of PTG of 1790 nurses was 67.17 Ã‚Â± 14.79. The analysis revealed that good social support and self-efficacy were important factors to improve the level of PTG of clinical nurses, while bad psychological state and working for many years were the negative factors of PTG. Good social support and self-efficacy can help clinical nurses cope with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and accept the disease's challenges. If these factors can be considered in clinical practice, this will help promote clinical nurses' mental health.","Zhang, Shi, Qin Ren, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S307294","20210603","COVID-19; influencing factors; nurse; post-traumatic growth; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14321,""
"Mood and emotional reactivity of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: short-term and long-term effects and the impact of social and socioeconomic stressors","Adolescence is a formative period for socio-emotional development which is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal study examined two aims: (1) the short- and long-term effects of the pandemic on young people's mood (i.e. vigor, tension, and depression levels) and emotional reactivity (i.e. fluctuations in daily mood), and (2) the impact of stressors on mood, emotional reactivity, self-oriented (i.e. maladaptive behavior towards COVID-19 rules) and other-benefitting behaviors (i.e. behavior aimed at helping and comforting others). We conducted an online two-week daily diary study among 462 Dutch adolescents (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.27Ã‚Â years, 64% females) and 371 young adults (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21.49Ã‚Â years, 81% females) in May 2020, with a follow-up in November 2020 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°238 and 231, respectively adolescents and young adults). In May 2020, young adults and older relative to younger adolescents showed higher levels and more fluctuations in tension and depression and lower levels of vigor. Vigor levels decreased and tension and depression levels increased between May 2020 and November 2020, especially for younger adolescents. There were positive associations between instability of negative emotions (i.e. tension and depression fluctuations) and the exposure to stressors (i.e. family stress and inequality of online homeschooling) in the adolescent sample. Together, this study demonstrates vulnerability regarding young people's mood and emotional reactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for adolescents who experience more stressors.","Green, van de Groep, Sweijen, Becht, Buijzen, de Leeuw, Remmerswaal, van der Zanden, Engels, Crone","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90851-x","20210603","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14322,""

"[COVID-19 effect on mental health and sleep disorders]","To study the prevalence of anxiety-depressive disorders and sleep disorders in their structure among patients hospitalized in connection with COVID-19, as well as to develop differentiated recommendations for their therapy in patients with new coronavirus infection. In this publication, the authors present preliminary results of their own observations of psychoemotional disorders and sleep disorders in their structure in patients with a new coronavirus infection. We analyzed the data of 119 patients (aged 47 to 69 years, male and female), conducted a detailed interview, including using telemedicine technologies, and assessed the scales: The hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), subjective the asthenia rating scale (MFI-20, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. According to the results of the HADS questionnaire, clinically pronounced anxiety-depressive symptoms were observed in 33 (28%) patients of 119 hospitalized in connection with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Of them, only clinically significant anxiety was recorded in 11% of cases (<i>n</i>=13), in 5 (4%) patients - clinically significant depression, an increase in both subscales of anxiety and depression - in 13% (<i>n</i>=15). An increase in the MFI-20 scale (more than 20 points) was found in 87 (73%) patients, sleep disorders in accordance with the PSQI questionnaire was recorded in 32 (27%) patients. According to the results of the study, it was noted that in most patients with COVID-19, along with a depressive symptom complex, anxiety and hypochondriacal disorders, an asthenic symptom complex, sleep disturbances with difficulty falling asleep, and dissatisfaction with the quality of sleep are recorded. Differentiated recommendations for the treatment of the studied conditions have been developed, taking into account the side effects of the prescribed drugs, drug interactions and the characteristics of the somatic status of patients. The choice of the drug should be based on the severity of the violations identified.

"Addressing the Clinical Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Mental Health","The COVID-19 pandemic impacts daily lives of families globally. Sequelae are not limited to physical consequences of medical complications but extend into social, emotional, spiritual, and psychological health. Interventions including mask-wearing and physical distancing are intended to prevent viral spread, but have unintended negative effects on mental health and child development. Although it is too early to know the full impact, practicing pediatric clinicians are well-positioned to help young people recover and thrive despite challenges presented. This article will review the impact of COVID-19 on child mental health and give practical interventions to foster resilience in youth and their families.","Bartek, Peck, Garzon, VanCleve","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2021.03.006","20210603","COVID-19; access to care; adolescent; mental health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14325,""
"How do you feel during the COVID-19 pandemic? A survey using psychological and linguistic self-report measures, and machine learning to investigate mental health, subjective experience, personality, and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students","The WHO has raised concerns about the psychological consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affecting health across societies, cultures and age-groups. This online survey study investigated mental health, subjective experience, and behaviour (health, learning/teaching) among university students studying in Egypt or Germany shortly after the first pandemic lockdown in May 2020. Psychological assessment included stable personality traits, self-concept and state-like psychological variables related to (a) mental health (depression, anxiety), (b) pandemic threat perception (feelings during the pandemic, perceived difficulties in describing, identifying, expressing emotions), (c) health (e.g., worries about health, bodily symptoms) and behaviour including perceived difficulties in learning. Assessment methods comprised self-report questions, standardized psychological scales, psychological questionnaires, and linguistic self-report measures. Data analysis comprised descriptive analysis of mental health, linguistic analysis of self-concept, personality and feelings, as well as correlational analysis and machine learning. NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°220 (107 women, 112 men, 1 = other) studying in Egypt or Germany provided answers to all psychological questionnaires and survey items. Mean state and trait anxiety scores were significantly above the cut off scores that distinguish between high versus low anxious subjects. Depressive symptoms were reported by 51.82% of the student sample, the mean score was significantly above the screening cut off score for risk of depression. Worries about health (mental and physical health) and perceived difficulties in identifying feelings, and difficulties in learning behaviour relative to before the pandemic were also significant. No negative self-concept was found in the linguistic descriptions of the participants, whereas linguistic descriptions of feelings during the pandemic revealed a negativity bias in emotion perception. Machine learning (exploratory) predicted personality from the self-report data suggesting relations between personality and subjective experience that were not captured by descriptive or correlative data analytics alone. Despite small sample sizes, this multimethod survey provides important insight into mental health of university students studying in Egypt or Germany and how they perceived the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in May 2020. The results should be continued with larger samples to help develop psychological interventions that support university students across countries and cultures to stay psychologically resilient during the pandemic.","Herbert, El Bolock, Abdennadher","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00574-x","20210603","Anxiety; COVID-19; Character computing; Corona virus; Depression; Emotion perception; Linguistic analysis; Machine learning; Mental health; Pandemic; Personality; Self-concept","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14326,""
"Evaluation of sleep quality and anxiety in Italian pediatric healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of this study was to evaluate sleep quality and psychological effects on pediatric healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and to evaluate differences between primary and secondary care operators. Pediatric healthcare workers were involved in an online survey toÃ‚Â assessÃ‚Â sleep quality, stress and anxiety level, self-efficacy and social support in Italian pediatric healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. We found that 67.4% of our sample suffered from sleep disturbance and 19.4% of subjects suffered from anxiety. Lower values of anxiety and social support were found in primary care staff compared to secondary care one. The associations between healthcare professional figures (being primary or secondary care operators) and mental health outcomes were not statistically significant. However, sex, age and having a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative/friend had an independent effect on mental health outcomes. It is crucial to provide social and psychological support to pediatric healthcare workers. A tailored psychological screening would be desirable for female healthcare workers and for those who have a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative/friend.","Di Filippo, Attanasi, Dodi, Porreca, Raso, Di Pillo, Chiarelli","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-021-05621-9","20210603","Anxiety; COVID-19; Female sex; Insomnia; Italy; PSQI; Pediatric staff; Self-efficacy; Social support; Stress; Zung index","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14327,""
"Distance learning in Italian primary and middle school children during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey","School closure created difficulties for parents, who were asked to care for their children and help them with schooling, while working at home. We aimed to explore the experiences in organising school for children at home and its implications on children's psychological well-being and educational progress during the quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationwide online survey of mothers of primary and middle school students was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic data and information on distance learning organisation and children's attitudes and behavioural changes were collected. 2149 mothers completed the survey, with a final sample of 1601 subjects. Large differences between primary and middle school emerged: lessons were less organised and routines were more instable for the youngest, who could not pay attention for more than 20Ã¢â‚¬â€°min (28.3%) and needed breaks every 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°min (21.6%), with lower quality of learning (40.6%), increased restlessness (69.1%), and aggressiveness (33.3%). A large use of screens was reported, with an abuse in screen time in 2%. Two thirds of mothers did not approve of distance learning (72.2%) because of their role in replacing teachers (77.8%), the effort required (66%), and the great commitment required (78.3%). Distance learning increased educational deprivation and social inequalities, especially for the youngest children, who lost almost one year of school. The situation was even worse for children with disabilities, who were neglected by the institutions. This period should be considered as an opportunity to correct the weaknesses of our school system.","Scarpellini, Segre, Cartabia, Zanetti, Campi, Clavenna, Bonati","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11026-x","20210603","COVID-19; Distance education; child psychology; childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mental health; home learning; quarantine; social isolation; surveys and questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14328,""

"A critical review: Recent advances in â€œdigitalâ€ biomolecule detection with single copy sensitivity","Detection of a single biomolecule, ranging from nucleic acids, proteins, viruses to bacteria, is of paramount importance in various fields including biology, environment, food and agriculture industry, public health, and medicine. With the understanding of the biological functions of these biomolecules (or bioparticles) and their impacts on public health, environmental pollution, and food safety, advanced detection techniques are unprecedentedly demanded for their early and/or sensitive detection. In this critical review, a series of elegant research about digital detection of biomolecules with potential single copy sensitivity is reviewed and summarized with the focus on the design principle and the innovation of how to accomplish the â€œdigitalâ€ detection concept. Starting with a brief introduction on the importance of digital detection, recent advances in â€œdigitalâ€ biomolecule detection with single copy sensitivity are grouped and discussed based on the difference of signal reporting systems, including surrogate signal development for â€œdigitalâ€ detection, direct visualization for â€œdigitalâ€ detection, and nucleic acid amplification enabled â€œdigitalâ€ detection. Interdisciplinary combination and integration of different cutting-edge techniques are also discussed with details. The review is closed with the conclusion and future trends.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112901","20210401","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-04","",14335,""
