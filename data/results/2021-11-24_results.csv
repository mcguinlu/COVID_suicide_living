The trend towards medicalization of various aspects of life has produced a reductionist approach to these phenomena, making it difficult to set boundaries between adolescence and illness. The Covid-19 pandemic accentuated the psychological distress among the adolescents. As an alternative to the medicalization of subjective crises, it is necessary to give a voice to the young people so that they can transform anguish and dismay into an active participation in the process of changing society.","Saggese, Edson","https://doi.org/10.1590/2175-6236109166","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: EducaÃ§Ã£o e Realidade; 46(1), 2021.; Publication details: EducaÃ§Ã£o e Realidade; 46(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22591,""
"Art and psychiatry in the 21st century: here's to more messy - and magical - entanglements","In a volatile world, during a time of multiple crises and amid a projected upsurge in mental illnesses as an aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, now is a critical time to consider how art and psychiatry can entangle with each other. Submissions like that of Lily Aston can create new spaces for conversation, reflection and constructive collisions. This can help disrupt and extend the state of psychiatry, management of psychiatric services, and education and training in mental healthcare, and advance how we understand other bodies and minds around us, and how knowledge can be created.","Tan, K.

"The Benefits of Living With Close Others: A Longitudinal Examination of Mental Health Before and During a Global Stressor","For better or worse, the people one lives with may exert a powerful influence on one?s mental health, perhaps especially during times of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic?a large-scale stressor that prompted health recommendations to stay home to reduce disease spread?provided a unique context for examining how the people who share one?s home may shape one?s mental health. A seven-wave longitudinal study assessed mental health month to month before and during the pandemic (February through September 2020) in two diverse samples of U.S. adults (N = 656;N = 544). Preregistered analyses demonstrated that people living with close others (children and/or romantic partners) experienced better well-being before and during the pandemic?s first 6 months. These groups also experienced unique increases in ill-being during the pandemic?s onset, but parents? ill-being also recovered more quickly. These findings highlight the crucial protective function of close relationships for mental health both generally and amid a pandemic.","Sisson, Natalie M.; Willroth, Emily C.; Le, Bonnie M.; Ford, Brett Q.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026211053320","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Clinical Psychological Science;: 21677026211053320, 2021.; Publication details: Clinical Psychological Science;: 21677026211053320, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22593,""
"A threat to life and livelihoods: examining the effects of the first wave of COVID-19 on health and wellbeing in Bengaluru and Patna slums","Taking advantage of our existing dataset of 6,721 slum households in two Indian cities, we undertook six rounds of follow-up phone interviews on the impact of COVID-19 between July and November 2020 with three key informants in each of 40 diverse slums. These cities showed contrasting health effects resulting from the first major wave of the COVID-19 pandemic ? no deaths and nearly no illnesses were reported in Patna, while there was widespread low-intensity sickness and a cluster of deaths in Bengaluru. We found no clear pattern in the links between outbreaks and city or neighbourhood characteristics. Livelihood effects, however, were devastating across both cities. All but a few slum dwellers lost their jobs for several months and survived by cutting back on essentials, incurring loans, liquidating assets, and seeking help from neighbours. Government assistance, generous in the early part of the lockdown, dwindled rapidly. Many will likely become chronically poor.","Downs-Tepper, Harlan, Krishna, Anirudh, Rains, Emily","https://doi.org/10.1177/09562478211048778","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Environment and Urbanization;: 09562478211048778, 2021.; Publication details: Environment and Urbanization;: 09562478211048778, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22594,""
"Wellbeing and mental health amongst medical students in Canada","RESEARCH: There is abundant data revealing that there is significant rate of rates of Psychiatric morbidity, psychological stress, and burnout in the medical student population. A core study group in the UK collaborated with 12 countries around the world to review medical student wellness. In this context we surveyed 101 medical students at the Cummings medical school, Calgary, Canada during the height of the COVID pandemic regarding their wellbeing and mental health. RESULTS/MAIN FINDINGS: Prior to medical school 27% reported a diagnosis with a mental disorder. Whilst at medical school 21% reported a mental health condition, most commonly an anxiety disorder and or depressive disorder. The most commonly reported source of stress was study at 81%, the second being relationships at 62%, money stress was a significant source of stress for 35%, and finally 10% reported accommodation or housing as stressful. Interestingly only 14% tested CAGE positive but 20% of students reported having taken a non-prescription substance to feel better or regulate their mood. Seventy-five percent of medical students met specific case criteria for exhaustion on the Oldenburg Burnout inventory 74% met criteria for the GHQ questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that medical students are facing significant stressors during their training. These stressors include, in order of frequency, study, relational, financial, and accommodation issues. Nonprescription Substance use was a common finding as well as exhaustion and psychiatric morbidity. Future interventions pursued will have to address cultural issues as well as the organizational and individual determinates of stress.","Wilkes, T.

"Caregiversâ€™ Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Their Childrenâ€™s Behavior","The COVID-19 pandemic has financial and emotional impacts on families. We explored how caregiversâ€™ financial strain and mental health are associated with changes in their young childrenâ€™s behavior during the pandemic. We additionally considered whether having a sense of purpose moderated these associations. Caregivers (&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 300) in the emergency department of a childrenâ€™s hospital were surveyed anonymously about changes to their employment (e.g., reduced/increased hours and job loss), ability to pay for expenses and whether their childâ€™s behavior had changed. Aligned with the Family Stress Model, caregiversâ€™ financial strain was associated with poor mental health, inconsistent sleep routines, and changes in childrenâ€™s problematic and prosocial behaviors. A sense of purpose buffered some of these relationships. Families are differently affected by the pandemic and our findings underscore the need for supporting caregiversâ€™ mental health and connecting them with resources.

"A systematic review","Background Individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than individuals without SPMI. In combination with physical distancing, hygiene protocols, and vaccines, quarantine and self-isolation are primary means of viral containment. However, individuals with SPMI may experience more difficulties with mandated quarantine or self-isolation because of their illness(es), stigma, and marginalization. To date, there is a lack of consensus on strategies that could aid such individuals in completing isolation. Aim This review aimed to synthesize evidence for interventions to support self-isolation and mandated quarantine for COVID-19 among individuals with SPMIs. Methods We followed the PRISMA guidelines, searching 19 electronic databases (9 published literature registries and 10 gray literature sources). We looked for relevant randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and program evaluations of the effectiveness of relevant psychosocial, pharmacological, harm reduction, and addiction management strategies to support isolation settings or quarantine requirements for individuals with any SPMI (e.g., any mental disorder, substance use disorder, or their combination). Findings Of 10,298 total records that were located, 5582 were duplicate citations. Upon screening the remaining 4716 unique records by title and abstract, we excluded a further 3562 records. Only one original article met our inclusion criteria after reviewing the full texts of the remaining 1154 citations. To support individuals experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco developed an isolation hotel that reduced COVID-19 hospital strain for 1009 participants (25% had a mental health disorder and 26% had a substance use disorder). While 81% completed their hotel stay, 48 patients had behavioral health needs that exceeded the hotel's capabilities. No other studies met our review's eligibility criteria. Most articles located by the search simply proposed solutions or discussed the challenges brought by COVID-19 for people with SPMIs. While some documents went a step further (e.g., shelter guidance documents to support individuals experiencing homelessness), these rarely addressed individuals with SPMIs directly. Conclusions This systematic review evaluated evidence from published and gray literature on interventions to support self-isolation and mandated COVID-19 quarantine for individuals with SPMIs. Only one study met our inclusion criteria. This study found a beneficial effect of a dedicated isolation hotel for individuals experiencing homelessness and COVID-19?where approximately 25%?50% of the study sample had a mental or substance use disorder. While there has been an abundance of COVID-19 protocols in general, information for SPMIs is lacking. As the pandemic continues and we better prepare for future pandemics, developing protocols for supporting SPMIs in this context is imperative.","Bahji, Anees, Bach, Paxton, Danilewitz, Marlon, el-Guebaly, Nady, Doty, Benjamin, Thompson, Laura, Clarke, Diana E.; Ghosh, Sumantra Monty, Crockford, David","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.prcp.20210022","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22597,""
"Examining the Impact of Gym Closures Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Combat Sport Athletesâ€™ Mental Health","Changes in exercise behavior and negative emotional states (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) in combat sport (e.g., boxing, wrestling, martial arts) athletes were examined the month prior to gym closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020), and approximately 1 month following gym closures (May 2020). A total of 312 combat sport athletes from 33 different countries responded to the study solicitation. Results indicated a significant decrease in combat sport training following gym closures;however, participation in other exercise activities did not significantly change. Significant mean increases in depression, anxiety, and stress were found following combat gym closures. Regression analyses revealed that number of hours of participants participated in combat sport training added significant incremental variance explained in depressive and stress symptoms above and beyond that accounted for by sex differences, preexisting conditions, and training level. Practical implications regarding losses to preferred exercise activities are discussed.","Levy, Jacob J.; Tarver, Terrance L.; Douglas, Hannah R.","https://doi.org/10.1123/jcsp.2021-0078","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology; 15(4):289-305, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology; 15(4):289-305, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22598,""
"Detection and identification of hazardous narcotics and new psychoactive substances (NPS)","In the past decade, consumption of illegal and controlled street drugs has steadily increased. According to the latest World Drug Report, released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)1, more people are using drugs, and there are more drugs, and more types of drugs, than ever. Around 269 million people used drugs worldwide in 2018, which is 30 per cent more than in 20091. The growth in global drug supply and demand poses challenges to law enforcement, compounds health risks and complicates efforts to prevent and treat drug use disorders. Due to COVID-19, traffickers may have to find new routes and methods and opioid shortages may result in people seeking out more readily available substances such as alcohol, benzodiazepines or mixing with synthetic drugs.1 Herein, we study the use of Raman SORS technology for rapid identification of narcotics in a range of concentrations â€“ from pure form (as it is smuggled or transported) to street forms and products, often mixed with conventional cutting agents, with the potential to improve safety, efficiency and critical decision making in incident management, search operations, policing and ports and border operations.

"Guest Editorial SSpecial Issueâ€”Selected Papers From ICOPS2020 & APCOPTS2020","The IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS) is held annually, sponsored by the Plasma Science and Applications Committee (PSAC) of the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Science Society (NPSS). The 47th IEEE NPSS ICOPS was organized ONLINE from December 06 to 10, 2020, by the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The ICOPS2020 was co-organized together with the 2nd Asia-Pacific Conference on Plasma and Terahertz Science (APCOPTS) which is envisioned as the future Asian version of the ICOPS series of conferences. The ICOPS2020 was initially planned as an onsite physical conference from May 24 to 28, 2020, at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was shifted to online virtual conference. The conferenceâ€™s technical program included a wide range of plasma science and technology topics, which ranged from basic and fundamental research to traditional and emerging technology applications. Since the ICOPS2020 was co-organized with APCOPTS, it also had a very strong coverage of fields related to terahertz science and applications. A total of 627 presentations from scientists and participants from over 41 countries were made at ICOPS2020 with a record total registration of 754. All presentations were recorded and were available to the registered participants for 90 days after the conference was over. The program also included a women-in-engineering talk by Jackie Y.

"Developing Apps for Researching the COVID-19 Pandemic with the TrackYourHealth Platform","Through lockdowns and other severe changes to daily life, almost everyone is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Scientists and medical doctors are - among others - mainly interested in researching, monitoring, and improving physical and mental health of the general population. Mobile health apps (mHealth), and apps conducting ecological momentary assessments (EMA) respectively, can help In this context. However, developing such mobile applications poses many challenges like costly software development efforts, strict privacy rules, compliance with ethical guidelines, local laws, and regulations. In this paper, we present TrackYourHealth (TYH), a highly configurable, generic. and modular mobile data collection and EMA platform, which enabled us to develop and release two mobile multi-platform applications related to COVID-19 in just a few weeks.

"The experiences of autistic adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and implications for autism services development","Purpose COVID-19 has been challenging for many in the UK. This is no different to many with autism spectrum disorder. Based on the experiences and issues raised by a small group of autistic women in an ongoing support group, consideration if this holds true for the wider adult autistic community across further lockdowns and restrictions to public life was explored. Design/methodology/approach An online questionnaire was created based on the issues raised. Participants indicated the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with each statement. Findings Autistic adults experienced an increase in anxiety and poor mental health, which in turn has exacerbated autistic features, such as rigidity. The data indicates that autistic adults can adapt to change provided there is support in maintaining routines. Research limitations/implications The research is limited due to the small number of participants (N = 120), as well as national variations in service provision. Practical implications Our data raises wider questions about the nature of support for autistic adults without cognitive impairments during times of crises and how services can respond and may even be shaped in the future to provide support that is cost-effective and relevant to autistic adults. Social implications To ensure that services have an awareness of how crises impact on autistic adults and how relatively simple changes may avert poor mental health. Originality/value That the creation of local support networks, and the ability to access these, is a key feature of autism-specific support.","Riese, B.; Mukherjee, R. A.

"Russian News Media, Digital Media, Informational Learned Helplessness, and Belief in COVID-19 Misinformation","The COVID-19 pandemic has been paired with a global misinformation ""infodemic."" Citizens in authoritarian countries, where most media is state controlled, often do not have access to credible information sources to help combat misinformation. In fact, the news media in these countries may be the primary drivers of misinformation while digital media may be sources of more accurate information.

"Major mental disorders in society during COVID-19","This work aimed to identify specific features of mental disorders associated with COVID-19. A comparative clinical psychopathological and psychodiagnostic study of 25 patients hospitalized at Shmeisani Hospital for the severe course of COVID-19 and 18 people without COVID-19 allowed a clearer gradation between psychogenic mental disorders associated with the pandemic situation as a stressor and mental disorders due to coronavirus disease. Statistical processing of the results was performed using online calculator medstatistic.ru. Anxiety about the cost of medical services turned out to be the main stressor and revealed feelings of insecurity and helplessness in front of the COVID-19 threat.

"Therapist adaptations for online caregiver emotion-focused family therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The urgency to implement distance-based methods to provide ongoing mental health care during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic represents a critical shift in treatment delivery for children, youth, and families. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional strain on the mental health of families and children. As a result, there is an increased need for brief, family-based interventions. Emotion-Focused Family Therapy (EFFT) is an empirically-supported intervention targeting caregivers of children with mental health challenges. The EFFT group therapy modality typically involves thirty caregivers who participate in a two-day intensive workshop, serving as a brief yet efficient intervention with enduring impact. Based on experiences within our clinic, this article provides practical intervention strategies to address common challenges therapists may contend with while providing EFFT intervention to caregivers and families through a secure videoconferencing platform. Additional research in distance-based mental health care for children and their caregivers can assess effectiveness, efficiency and improved access to mental health care throughout the pandemic.

"Study of the antidepressant properties of some plants","Currently, in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the level of mental disorders in the population due to self-isolation, the imposed quarantine regime, and an alarming media environment. Therefore, a very important world task today is the search and development of drugs that have psychotropic activity, reduce anxiety and aggression without negatively affecting psychomotor and cognitive functions, capable of preventing the development of mental disorders in the population. These products are, first of all, products of natural origin. This article presents the results of a study of the antidepressant effect in plants of the genus Hedysarum (roots of H. theinum Krasnob., roots of H. neglectum Ledeb., herbs H. alpinum L.) and of the genus Garcinia (pericarp of the fruit of G. mangostana L.). A pronounced anti- anxiety effect of herbal extracts and, at the same time, a complete absence of a depriming effect is shown, which justifies the possibility of using these drugs for the prevention and correction of mental disorders associated with aggression, an increased level of anxiety, and impaired cognitive functions.

"Perceptions, experiences and opportunities for occupational safety and health professionals arising out of the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study explored perceptions, experiences and opportunities for the occupational safety and health professional (OSHP) as a result of COVID-19. Using qualitative methods, interviews took place with OSHPs in two organisations to understand how their role developed during the pandemic. Additionally, seven focus groups were organised and met virtually, using the Zoom platform, each addressing a different topic identified by the researchers. Participants (n = 45) from 10 different countries were distributed among the focus groups. Topics were separated into four themes: impact on the workplace;the psychosocial dynamic;medical and health issues and occupational safety and health (OSH) issues. Results were subsequently divided into seven action categories and compared with the findings from the organisational interviews. Comparison pointed to an expanded role for the OSHP including business continuity, resilience and wellbeing in addition to assessing and controlling risks emerging during the pandemic. There is also the need for a means to adequately disseminate trustworthy information. Results indicated that there was no single â€˜averageâ€™ role of the OSHP, demonstrating essential contributions as a member of the management team. Results also stressed that the pandemic carried three health-related co-morbidities, stress, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and burnout. Directions for future research included: the education of the OSHP to support a move away from compliance towards risk management;determining how mental health issues in organisations should be managed;expanded roles for OSHPs within business;and implications for professional bodies, membership institutions and academia in supporting the above-mentioned emerging roles.","Gold, David, Hughes, Stuart, Thomas, David","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00955-y","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 8(1), 2021.; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 8(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22610,""
"Prevalence of Internet Addiction Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic among Students at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany","Purpose Internet addiction is a behavioral disorder that primarily affects adolescents and young adults, including college students. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in severe changes in students' daily lives due to the pandemic containment measures. Therefore, the current study addressed the question of the prevalence of internet addiction among college students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, socio-demographic (gender, subject group) and health factors (depression symptoms, loneliness, anxiety, and impulsivity) were considered in terms of how they are associated with internet addiction. Methods In the present study, two samples of students at Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) Mainz participated in online surveys on various health topics and their present study situation. The data collection took place in both summer 2019 (N = 4,351) and summer 2020 (N = 3,066) during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the JGU's health project ""Healthy Campus Mainz-gesund studieren"" on prevention and health promotion among students. Frequency measures for prevalence were calculated and associations with gender, depression symptoms, loneliness, anxiety, and impulsivity were analyzed using logistic regression. Results The prevalence of internet addiction symptoms was 3.9 % in 2019, while it was significantly higher with 7.8 % during the pandemic. While male gender was still associated with internet addiction in 2019 (OR2019 =0.685, p &lt; 0.05), no gender discrepancy was found in 2020. Both before and during the pandemic, depression symptoms (OR2019 = 1.121, p &lt; 0.001;OR2020 = 1.175, p &lt; 0.001) and loneliness (OR2019 = 1.121, p &lt; 0.001;OR2020 = 1.071, p &lt; 0.05) were associated with internet addiction. Additionally, anxiety also played a role in the association with internet addiction during the pandemic (OR2020= 1.156, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Students represent a highly vulnerable group for internet addiction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the symptomatology occurred significantly more often than in the year before. It is highly needed to implement appropriate prevention and intervention services for students that address both internet addiction as well as associated problems such as depression and loneliness.","Werner, A.

"Understanding Gun Violence: Factors Associated With Beliefs Regarding Guns, Gun Policies, and Gun Violence INTRODUCTION","Objective: Gun violence is a pressing public health concern, particularly in the United States. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a record-breaking year with 43,551 deaths attributed to gun violence in the U.S., with almost 20,000 classified as murder/unintentional death and more than 24,000 classified as suicide (Gun Violence Archive, 2021). Black men are 10 times more likely to die from gun violence than are white men (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020c). Yet, in proportion to these sobering statistics, researchers' knowledge of the range of causes and possible remedies remains negligible. The purpose of this Special Issue of the Psychology of Violence devoted to Gun Violence was to highlight and spur additional, psychologically oriented research regarding firearm violence. Method: This Special Issue consists of seven original U.S.-based studies that address various aspects of gun violence, including individual, geographical, psychological, and sociological factors associated with attitudes toward guns, gun policies, and gun violence. Results: Individually and collectively, these studies provide novel insights regarding different types of gun perceptions and beliefs. These works consider a wide range of factors including media exposure, beliefs about the link between mental illness and gun violence, cumulative trauma, masculinity norms, regional norms, and trust in law enforcement. Discussion: This Special Issue is intended to spark greater interest in working to mitigate firearm violence and encourage researchers across scientific disciplines to collaboratively apply their theoretical perspectives and methodologies to reduce the devastating, but understudied, U.S. gun violence epidemic.","Wamser-Nanney, R.","https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000392","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Psychology of Violence; 11(4):349-353, 2021.; Publication details: Psychology of Violence; 11(4):349-353, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22612,""
"A large-scale study of changes to the quantity, quality, and distribution of video game play during a global health pandemic","Video game play has been framed as both protective factor and risk to mental health during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted a statistical analysis of changes to video game play during the pandemic to better understand gaming behavior and in doing so provide an empirical foundation to the fractured discourse surrounding play and mental health. Analyses of millions of players' engagement with the 500 globally most popular games on the Steam platform indicated that the quantity of play had dramatically increased during key points of the pandemic;that those increases were more prominent for multiplayer games, suggesting that gamers were seeking out the social affordances of video game play;and that play had become more equally distributed across days of the week, suggesting increased merging of leisure activities with work and school activities. These results provide a starting point for empirically grounded discussions on video games during the pandemic, their uses, and potential effects.

"Anxiety and Depression among women with COVID 19 infection during childbirth â€“ Experience from a tertiary care academic center","Abstarct Background: Pregnancy and postpartum are vulnerable periods for mental health problems and distress. Studies conducted worldwide have highlighted the role of the Corona Virus Disease-19(COVID-19) pandemic in adding to rates of depression and anxiety in the perinatal period. However, there are very few reports on mothers who were identified as having COVID-19 infection at the time of childbirth. Objective(s): Our study aimed to find the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pregnant women admitted for labor who tested positive for COVID 19 infection. To study the association of various sociodemographic, social support, obstetric factors as well as that of COVID 19 related worries to depression and anxiety. Study Design: The study was conducted at the obstetrics inpatient setting in a public hospital in New Delhi which had a separate designated COVID-19 block. Pregnant and postpartum women &gt;18 years of age, who were admitted to the COVID 19 maternity ward for delivery were included for this study. Women were interviewed within the first week of admission and after 6-8 weeks of childbirth. Sociodemographic and obstetric details as well as COVID-19 related worries and concerns were assessed. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9(PHQ-9)and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire respectively. Statistical analysis:The normally distributed variables are expressed as mean Â± standard deviation and continuous variables with skewed distribution as median (interquartile range). Categorical data presented as proportions categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test/Fischer's exact test. All tests are two-sided with a significance level of 5%. Data were analyzed using SPSS software Version 24. Rates of depression and anxiety were calculated and univariate analysis was done to identify factors associated with moderate and severe anxiety and depression, using various socio-demographic and obstetric variables, the total COVID Anxiety Scale scores, social support score. Results: The mean age of the women was 26.86Â±4.31 years. Of the 243 women assessed using the PHQ 9, 168(69.13%) had mild depressive disorder, and 29(11.3%) had moderate depressive disorder. Of 187 women who were assessed at the 6 weeks follow up, 31(16.57%) had minimal, 131(70.05%) mild depression and 25 (13.36%) had moderate depression. Mild anxiety was seen in 121(49.79%) and 13 (5.34%), had moderate anxiety symptoms. Women reported several worries especially about stigma of COVID 19 infection, support for infant care and access to infant health services. Conclusions: Screening for common mental illnesses with timely identification of associated risk factors should be done with liaison between obstetricians and mental health professionals. Obstetricians can address and reassure pregnant women regarding concerns about contracting the infection, worries about possible effects of COVID-19 on the fetus and newborn and concerns about future consultations. In case the worries are out of proportion and necessitate intervention by mental health professional's referral services should be made available. Hence identifying and addressing the mental health concerns will help to provide the optimum perinatal care during the pandemic.","Bachani, Dr Sumitra, Sahoo, Dr Sushree Monika, Nagendrappa, Dr Sachin, Dabral, Dr Anjali, Chandra, Dr Prabha, Dabral, Dr Anjali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xagr.2021.100033","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: AJOG Global Reports;: 100033, 2021.; Publication details: AJOG Global Reports;: 100033, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22614,""
"Public interest and awareness regarding general health, sleep quality and mental wellbeing during the early COVID-19 pandemic period: An exploration using Google Trends","The internet network continues to be a major source of health-related information. Our research provides insights into the online health-seeking behaviors of the general population, and evaluates the potential relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and public interest and awareness of general sleep health, mental health and wellbeing. Google Trendsâ€™ weekly relative search volumes (RSVs) were examined during 2020 for searches specifically related to COVID-19 symptoms, and for searches related to general health, sleep and wellbeing, in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, Italy and Japan. To obtain insight into the association between the initiation of public restrictions and online search trends, we assessed a six-week period;the â€˜early pandemic periodâ€™ (EPP) (01 March 2020 â€“ 11Â AprilÂ 2020). To provide a meaningful pre-pandemic comparison, a similar period during 2019 (03 March â€“ 13 April 2019) was compared for RSV and median difference analysis. The EPP was associated with increased online searches related to COVID-19 symptoms, as compared with those related to more general sleep health, mental health and wellbeing. The latter search terms frequently showed a decrease or minimal change in RSV during the EPP compared with the equivalent period inÂ 2019. This finding illustrates the potential link between the COVID-19 pandemic and online search behavior and corroborates existing findings regarding internet searches during this period. Proactive communication by healthcare professionals during future pandemics and as an ongoing measure could help prevent public neglect of general health and wellbeing symptoms, and encourage reporting and early intervention.","Lemoine, Patrick, Ebert, David, Koga, Yoshihiko, Bertin, Claire","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleepe.2021.100017","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sleep Epidemiology;: 100017, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep Epidemiology;: 100017, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22615,""
"Intentos e ideas de suicidio durante la pandemia por COVID-19 en comparaciÃ³n con los aÃ±os previos","Resumen IntroducciÃ³n: Desde el inicio de la pandemia por COVID-19 se ha alertado sobre los efectos que Ã©sta tendrÃ­a en la salud mental de la poblaciÃ³n y se habÃ­a previsto un aumento de las tasas de suicidio como ocurriÃ³ en pandemias previas. Los estudios realizados hasta la fecha difieren respecto a si durante la pandemia por COVID se estÃ¡n viendo afectadas las tasas de suicidio. Material y mÃ©todos: Se han incluido todos los individuos registrados por ideas o intentos de suicidio en el CÃ³digo Riesgo Suicidio (CRS) que pertenecen a la ciudad de Barcelona desde el 01 de Enero de 2018 hasta el 30 de Junio de 2021. Se ha realizado un anÃ¡lisis bivariado entre el periodo 2018-2019 y el periodo de pandemia. Se ha calculado el crecimiento porcentual de la incidencia mensual de los casos de CRS, utilizando como referencia la media de la incidencia mensual del periodo 2018-2019. Resultados: Se registraron un total de 3388 consultas por ideas o intentos de suicidio. Se ha producido un incremento del 43,20% en la incidencia mensual de ideas e intentos de suicidio durante la pandemia en comparaciÃ³n con el periodo 2018-2019, alcanzando un incremento mÃ¡ximo del 573.8% en menores de edad en el mes de mayo de 2021. Conclusiones: Durante el periodo de pandemia por COVID-19 se han incrementado las consultas por ideas e intentos de suicidio respecto a los 2 aÃ±os previos en la ciudad de Barcelona. Cabe destacar este crecimiento especialmente en menores de edad. Introduction: Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, warnings have been made about the impact on the mental health of the population and as occurred in previous pandemics, an increase in suicide rates had been anticipated. To date, studies differ with regard to whether suicide rates are being affected during the COVID pandemic. Material and methods: All individuals registered for suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt in the Suicide Risk Code (CRS) from the city of Barcelona from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021 have been included. A bivariate analysis has been carried out between the 2018-2019 period and the pandemic period. The percentage increase in the monthly incidence of CRS cases has been calculated, using the average monthly incidence for the 2018-2019 period as a reference. Results: A total of 3388 consultations for suicide ideation or suicidal attempt were registered.

"Consequences of pandemic-associated social restrictions: Role of social support and the oxytocin system","During pandemics, governments take drastic actions to prevent the spreading of the disease, as seen during the present COVID-19 crisis. Sanctions of lockdown, social distancing and quarantine urge people to exclusively work and teach at home and to restrict social contacts to a minimum;lonely people get into further isolation, while families` nerves are strained to the extreme. Overall, this results in a dramatic and chronic increase in the level of psychosocial stress over several months mainly caused by i) social isolation and ii) psychosocial stress associated with overcrowding, social tension in families, and domestic violence. Moreover, pandemic-associated social restrictions are accompanied by loss of an essential stress buffer and important parameter for general mental and physical health: social support. Chronic psychosocial stress and, in particular, social isolation and lack of social support affect not only mental health, but also the brain oxytocin system and the immune system. Hence, pandemic-associated social restrictions are expected to increase the risk of developing psychopathologies, such as depression, anxiety-related and posttraumatic stress disorders, on the one hand, but also to induce a general inflammatory state and to impair the course of infectious disorders on the other. Due to its pro-social and stress-buffering effects, resulting in an anti-inflammatory state in case of disease, the role of the neuropeptide oxytocin will be discussed and critically considered as an emerging treatment option in cases of pandemic-induced psychosocial stress, viral infection and during recovery. In this review, we aim to critically focus on possible short- and long-term consequences of social restrictions on mental health and the immune system, while discussion oxytocin as a possible treatment option.","Gryksa, Katharina, Neumann, Inga D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105601","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychoneuroendocrinology;: 105601, 2021.; Publication details: Psychoneuroendocrinology;: 105601, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22617,""
"Mental Health Service Provision at School-Based Health Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Findings from a National Listening Session","Mental health issues are the leading cause of disability among youth, especially among those in underserved communities. School-based health centers (SBHCs) increase equity by providing health services to more than six million youth annually, a majority of whom reside in resource-limited communities. When schools throughout the United States closed in spring 2020, many SBHCs were also forced to close physical operations. This study uses qualitative data collected from SBHC representatives nationwide to examine: 1) supports and challenges that affect the provision of mental health services in SBHCs during the COVID-19 pandemic;2) changes in the provision of mental health services at SBHCs one year into the pandemic compared to before the pandemic;and 3) SBHCsâ€™ priorities for assessing and supporting student mental health needs in the 2021-22 school year. Study findings highlight how SBHCs pivoted, even with limited resources, to meet studentsâ€™ increasing needs for mental health care.","Sullivan, Erin, Geierstanger, Sara, Soleimanpour, Samira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2021.11.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Health Care;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Health Care;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22618,""
"Long Term Predictors of Breathlessness, Exercise Intolerance, Chronic Fatigue and Well-being in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Cohort Study with 4 Months Median Follow-up","Background Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is an emerging healthcare burden. We therefore aimed to determine predictors of different functional outcomes after hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19. Methods An ambidirectional cohort study was conducted between May and July 2020, in which PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients underwent a standardized telephone assessment between 6 weeks and 6 months post discharge. We excluded patients who died, had a mental illness or failed to respond to two follow-up phone calls. The medical research council (MRC) dyspnea scale, metabolic equivalent of task (MET) score for exercise tolerance, chronic fatigability syndrome (CFS) scale and World Health Organization-five well-being index (WHO-5) for mental health were used to evaluate symptoms at follow-up. Results 375 patients were contacted and 153 failed to respond. The median timing for the follow-up assessment was 122 days (IQR, 109â€“158). On multivariate analyses, female gender, pre-existing lung disease, headache at presentation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, critical COVID-19 and post-discharge ER visit were predictors of higher MRC scores at follow-up. Female gender, older age &gt;67 years, arterial hypertension and emergency room (ER) visit were associated with lower MET exercise tolerance scores. Female gender, pre-existing lung disease, and ER visit were associated with higher risk of CFS. Age, dyslipidemia, hypertension, pre-existing lung disease and duration of symptoms were negatively associated with WHO-5 score. Conclusions Several risk factors were associated with an increased risk of PACS. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are at risk for PACS may benefit from a targeted pre-emptive follow-up and rehabilitation programs.","Tleyjeh, Imad M.; Saddik, Basema, Ramakrishnan, Rakhee K.; AlSwaidan, Nourah, AlAnazi, Ahmed, Alhazmi, Deema, Aloufi, Ahmad, AlSumait, Fahad, Berbari, Elie F.; Halwani, Rabih","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.11.016","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Infection and Public Health;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Infection and Public Health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22619,""
"Child Suicide Rates During the COVID-19 pandemic in England","Background There is concern about the impact of COVID-19, and the control measures to prevent the spread, on children's mental health. The aim of this work was to identify if there had been a rise of childhood suicide during the COVID pandemic. Method Using data from England's National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) the characteristics and rates of children dying of suicide between April to December 2020 were compared with those in 2019. In a subset (1st January to 17th May 2020) further characteristics and possible contributing factors were obtained. Results A total of 193 likely childhood deaths by suicide were reported. There was no evidence overall suicide deaths were higher in 2020 than 2019 (RR 1.09 (0.80-1.48), p=0.584) but weak evidence that the rate in the first lockdown period (April to May 2020) was higher than the corresponding period in 2019 (RR 1.56 (0.86-2.81), p=0.144). Characteristics of individuals were similar between periods. Social restrictions (e.g. to education), disruption to care and support services, tensions at home and isolation appeared to be contributing factors. Limitations As child suicides are fortunately rare, the analysis is based on small numbers of deaths with limited statistical power to detect anything but major increases in incidence. Conclusion We found no consistent evidence that child suicide deaths increased during the COVID-19 pandemic although there was a possibility that they may have increased during the first UK lockdown. A similar peak was not seen during the following months, or the second lockdown.","Odd, David, Williams, Tom, Appleby, Louis, Gunnell, David, Luyt, Karen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100273","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100273, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100273, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22620,""
"Suicide-related thoughts and behavior and suicide death trends during the COVID-19 in the general population of Catalonia, Spain: SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND DEATH DURING COVID-19 IN CATALONIA","The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to increase suicidal behavior. However, data available to date are inconsistent. This study examines suicidal behavior and death trends in 2020 relative to 2019 as an approximation to the impact of the pandemic on suicidal behavior and death in the general population of Catalonia, Spain. Data on suicide-related thoughts and behaviors (STBs) and suicidal mortality were obtained from the Catalonia Suicide Risk Code (CSRC) register and the regional police, respectively. We compared the monthly crude incidence of STBs and suicide mortality rates of 2020 with those of 2019. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess changes in trends over time during the studied period. In 2020, 4,263 consultations for STBs and 555 suicide deaths were registered in Catalonia (approx. 7.5 million inhabitants). Compared to 2019, in 2020 STBs rates decreased an average of 6.3% (incidence rate ratio, IRR=0.94, 95% CI 0,90-0,98) and overall suicide death rates increased 1.2% (IRR=1.01, 95% CI 0.90-1.13). Joinpoint regression results showed a substantial decrease in STBs rates with a monthly percent change (MPC) of -22.1 (95% CI: -41.1, 2.9) from January-April 2020, followed by a similar increase from April-July 2020 (MPC=24.7, 95% CI: -5.9, 65.2). The most restrictive measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced consultations for STBs, suggesting that the â€œstay at homeâ€ message may have discouraged people from contacting mental health services. STBs and mortality should continue to be monitored in 2021 and beyond to understand better the mid-to-long term impact of COVID-19 on suicide trends.","PÃ©rez, V.; Elices, M.; Vilagut, G.; Vieta, E.; Blanch, J.; Serrano, E.

"Experiences with Substance Use Disorder Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a Multistate Survey","Background Drug overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for expanded and accessible substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Relatively little is known about the experiences of patients receiving treatment during the pandemic. Methods We worked with 21 harm reduction and drug treatment programs in nine states and the District of Columbia from August 2020 to January 2021. Programs distributed study recruitment cards to clients. Clients responded to the survey by calling a study hotline and providing a unique study identification number. Our survey included detailed questions about use of SUD treatment prior to and since the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified settings where individuals received treatment and, for those treated for opioid use disorder, we examined use of medications for opioid use disorder. Individuals also reported whether they had received telehealth treatment and pandemic related treatment changes (e.g., more take-home methadone). We calculated p-values for differences pre and since COVID-19. Results We interviewed 587 individuals of whom 316 (53.8%) were in drug treatment both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals in treatment reported substantial reductions in in-person service use since the start of the pandemic, including a 27 percentage point reduction (p&lt;.001) in group counseling sessions and 28 percentage point reduction in mutual aid group participation (p&lt;.001). By contrast, individuals reported a 21 percentage point increase in receipt of overdose education (p&lt;.001). Most people receiving medications for opioid use disorder reported taking methadone and had high continuity of treatment (86.1% received methadone pre-COVID and 87.1% since-COVID, p=0.71). Almost all reported taking advantage of new policy changes such as counseling by video/phone, increased take-home medication, or fewer urine drug screens. Overall, respondents reported relatively high satisfaction with their treatment and with telehealth adaptations (e.g., 80.2% reported â€œI'm able to get all the treatment that I needâ€). Conclusions Accommodations to treatment made under the federal public health emergency appear to have sustained access to treatment in the early months of the pandemic. Since these changes are set to expire after the official public health emergency declaration, further action is needed to meet the ongoing need.","Saloner, Brendan, Krawczyk, Noa, Solomon, Keisha, Allen, Sean T.; Morris, Miles, Haney, Katherine, Sherman, Susan G.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103537","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103537, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103537, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22623,""

"Iterative development and pilot testing of an intervention fidelity monitoring plan for the enhanced, electronic health record-facilitated pragmatic clinical trial: Implications for training and protocol integrity","Fidelity monitoring is the degree to which a clinical trial intervention is implemented as intended by a research protocol. Consistent implementation of research protocols supported with extant fidelity monitoring plans contribute rigor and validity of study results. Fidelity monitoring plans should be comprehensive yet practical to accommodate the realities of conducting research, particularly a pragmatic clinical trial, in dynamic settings with heterogeneous patient populations. The purposes of this paper are to describe the (1) iterative development and implementation of protocols for intervention fidelity monitoring, (2) pilot testing of the fidelity monitoring plan, (3) the identification of interventionist training deficiencies, and (4) opportunities to enhance protocol rigor for a cancer symptom management intervention delivered through the electronic health record patient portal and telephone as part of a complex, multi-component pragmatic clinical trial to uncover training deficits and bolster protocol integrity. The intervention focuses on prominent symptoms reported among medical oncology patients including sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, depression, low energy (fatigue) and physical function. In this pragmatic trial, the role of interventionist is a registered nurse symptom care manager (RN SCM). A three-part fidelity monitoring plan with checklists audit: Part-1 RN SCM role training activities in research components, clinical training components, and protocol simulation training;Part-2 RN SCM adherence to the intervention core components delivered over the telephone;and Part-3 maintenance of adherence to core intervention components. The goal isÂ =Â 80% adherence to components of each of the three checklists. An initial pilot test of the fidelity monitoring plan was conducted to evaluate the checklists and the RN SCM adherence to core protocol components. RN SCM skills and training deficits were identified during the pilot phase, as were opportunities to improve protocol integrity. Overall, approximately 50% of the audited RN SCM telephone calls had =80% fidelity to the core components. There remains on-going need for RN SCM training and skill building in action planning. The content presented in this paper is intended to begin to fill the gap of fidelity monitoring plans for complex interventions tested in pragmatic clinical trials and delivered remotely in an effort to strengthen protocol integrity.","Chlan, Linda L.; Ridgeway, Jennifer L.; Tofthagen, Cindy S.; Hamann, Brianne R.; Mele, Kendra E.; Dozois, Donna, Ness, Sheryl M.; Peterson, Laura J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2021.100868","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications;: 100868, 2021.; Publication details: Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications;: 100868, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22625,""
"A study protocol for a randomised controlled trial on the efficacy of yoga as an adjuvant therapy for patients with Ankylosing spondylitis amidst COVID-19 pandemic","Background Amidst the adversities of the COVID 19 pandemic, the health care system has seen a new paradigm shift towards e-health services. In the advent of catering to the geometrically increasing health care needs of the patients suffering from various chronic health conditions when in social isolation, the need for the shift seems to be paramount. Patients with Ankylosing spondylitis under immunosuppressants and variable degrees of disabilities are at higher risk. This study aims to assess the efficacy of e-Yoga as a treatment option for these patients in need. Methods This is a single-center, parallel-group prospective randomized, open-blinded end-point trial. Patients aged between 30 to 50 years will be recruited from the members of Antardhwani: A society of ankylosing spondylitis, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The yoga experts will administer a scientifically developed and validated Yoga module via e-Yoga modalities.

"Scaling up of mental health services in the digital age: The rise of technology and its application to low- and middle-income countries","This chapter describes the rapid spread of digital mental health technologies across the world and further explores specific case studies in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We are increasingly seeing rapid rates of technological innovation and adaptation in low-resource settings including the widespread use of smartphone mobile devices, apps and web-based platforms. Health-care settings have taken advantage of this growth and are maximizing its potential by introducing these technologies in their service delivery. These technologies have been applied to various settings such as training of health workers, screening patients, and care delivery. This chapter explores five major areas benefitting from these emerging technologies: (1) community outreach, challenging stigma, and spreading awareness, (2) youth mental health, (3) mental health in humanitarian settings, (4) clinical care and frontline health workers, and (5) technology for severe mental disorders. We close the chapter with a discussion of broad ethical considerations in LMICs, highlighting risks pertaining to misinformation, victimization, and widening health inequities. Finally, we emphasize the role of digital technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic in addressing the potential rise and exacerbation of mental health problems, and how these technologies can potentially be leveraged to alleviate this burden through the remote provision of essential mental health services.","Siddiqui, Saher, Gonsalves, Pattie P.; Naslund, John A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-822201-0.00004-6","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Mental Health in a Digital World;: 459-479, 2022.; Publication details: Mental Health in a Digital World;: 459-479, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22627,""
"The effects on student pass rates during the pandemic, 2020, and the perceptions of the faculty who taught during the crisis","This mixed methods study at Delaware Technical Community College documented a turbulent time in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Student pass rates in the spring 2019 and spring 2020 semesters were analyzed using a paired t-test. The null hypothesis, P1 = P2, was rejected, at alpha = .05 level of significance. Pass rates were disaggregated by discipline (subject), gender, race, and ethnicity. Statistical significance was found in criminal justice, English, math, physics, social science, and first-year seminar courses. Statistical significance varied by gender, race, and ethnicity. Faculty who taught during the spring 2020 semester were surveyed about their perceived experiences during the rapid shift to emergency remote learning and how they could be better prepared to provide academic continuity and support students in the face of a disaster. All respondents when asked about supports need indicated all resources queried would be ""helpful"" or ""perhaps helpful"" and resoundingly believed support of student success was most needed. Faculty responded about changes made to their courses when transitioned to remote learning. Results indicated 100% of faculty made at least one change in their courses and 100% used at least one new teaching technique. Analysis of the qualitative data about faculty experience of the rapid transition to remote learning found faculty perceived time was the most problematic. Other themes were mental health specific to stress, challenges, and working from home;lack of needed resources;and concerns of student success. Faculty responses to what support they needed to be better prepared to provide academic continuity and meet the needs of students indicated comprehensive support, time reallocation, resources, professional development, disaster/pandemic plan, and support for students. The literature review found few institutions had a comprehensive disaster plan that includes academic continuity in the face of a disaster. The conclusion of this study suggests all institutions write, review, practice, and revise a comprehensive disaster plan as supported by these results and the literature reviewed.

"TEMPORARY REGULATION OF COMPETITION AND CORONAVIRUS","Competition law as one of the foundations of a market economy whose main purpose is to ensure an equal position of entrepreneurs in the market, regardless of the size, market power and other features of the implied system of state aid both at central and local and regional level. The aim and purpose of this research is a clear and tentative way of pointing out the importance of competition in relation to coronavirus. In order to achieve this goal, the paper seeks to provide scientifically based answers to a number of current issues, starting from detention from the definitions of competition and coronavirus. In addition to the above, it is necessary to consider how this disease affected entrepreneurship, which had positive and negative consequences. In addition, it is important to note that it has left a significant impact on our mental health. The main results of the research point to the fact that the coronavirus as a global, economic and health crisis suddenly caught us all overnight and as such changed our lives. In addition to greatly affecting the economy, there is also a blow to the company. In case of suspicion of infection, the obligation to call a doctor, ie a territorially competent epidemiologist, and the obligation to go to an outpatient clinic are determined as a preventive measure. In this paper, qualitative research in correlation with quantitative research was used. Starting from the fact that quantitative research is based on the description of individual conditions, ie the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships, the paper in a representative way seeks to simplify the concept of competition as the drivingforce of a market economy that entails many benefits consumer choice, innovation. In addition, considering the coronavirus from a quantitative point of view, it is manifested in how the coronavirus as a new strain of virus, discovered in humans, 'stirred' the whole world as such forced people to care about their health and the health of our loved ones. Also, an obligation to adhere to epidemiological measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection has been introduced. Qualitative research, as a term used to describe research that focuses on the way individuals and groups view and understand the world, also has a significant impact on this work, primarily because it considers how the pandemic affected the health of people interacting with each other.","Vodanovic, Darija magiur","https://www.google.com/search?q=TEMPORARY+REGULATION+OF+COMPETITION+AND+CORONAVIRUS","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series;: 341-363, 2021.; Publication details: EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series;: 341-363, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22630,""
"Mental health and coping strategies in graduate students in the COVID-19 pandemic Salud mental y estrategias de afrontamiento en estudiantes de postgrado durante la pandemia de COVID-19 SaÃºde mental e estratÃ©gias de coping em pÃ³s-graduandos na pandemia da COVID-19","Objective: to verify the relation of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms with coping strategies in graduate students in the context of the new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Method: an electronic cross-sectional and correlational survey was conducted with 331 Brazilian graduate students, aged 20-64 years old, who answered an online form containing a sociodemographic data questionnaire, a coping strategies scale, and the DASS-21 scale. Descriptive analysis, Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Spearmanâ€™s correlation were performed. Results: the main results indicated that maintaining work and study routines, as well as a religious practice, is correlated with lower scores of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, as well as with coping strategies that can act as protective factors. Conclusion: the new coronavirus pandemic has strained public health and increased the need for studies aimed at understanding the impact of the event on the mental health of the population. It is suggested that employment and religiousness should be considered in interventions with graduate students.","Scorsolini-Comin, Fabio, Patias, Naiana Dapieve, Cozzer, Alisson Junior, Flores, Pedro Augusto Warken, Hohendorff, Jean Von","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+and+coping+strategies+in+graduate+students+in+the+COVID-19+pandemic+Salud+mental+y+estrategias+de+afrontamiento+en+estudiantes+de+postgrado+durante+la+pandemia+de+COVID-19+SaÃºde+mental+e+estratÃ©gias+de+coping+em+pÃ³s-graduandos+na+pandemia+da+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Revista latino-americana de enfermagem; 29, 2021.; Publication details: Revista latino-americana de enfermagem; 29, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22631,""
"Housing: Often overlooked but a critical pillar for older adults","Housing is central to older adults' life outcomes. Housing's affordability, physical quality, and location can impact physical and mental health. Housing policies and practices have systematically limited access to homeownership for persons of color and segregated many into disadvantaged neighborhoods. For many, this has curtailed economic and wealth building opportunities over the life course and exposed them to negative health consequences of segregated neighborhoods. Encouraging and supporting equitable access to safe and quality housing options for older adults should be a role for all aging services stakeholders.

"The Issues and Analysis of Risk Management on an Example of the Azerbaijani Oil of Azeri Light in the Conditions of Uncertainty and COVID-19","[...]one of the most important functions of risk is its activity in conditions of uncertainty. An unexpected decline in oil prices in 2015-2016 and the strong imbalance between supply and demand in the oil market required measures to stabilize discontinuity in the oil market. After the sudden decrease in oil prices in 2015-2016 the minimum price of the Azerbaijani oil of ""Azeri Light"" brand was observed in January 2016 - $28.82 per barrel, even though the highest oil price was recorded in 2008 as $149.66 per barrel. [pic.1] [1][2][4] In general, a rash decline in oil prices negatively affected the economy of Azerbaijan in 2015-2016. In 2015 oil production in Azerbaijan amounted to 41 million 586 thousand tons, whereas in 2016 this figure was set at the level of 41 million 34.5 thousand tons of oil (by 1.3% less);in 2017- 38.688,900 tons (decrease of 5.7% compared to 2016);in 2018 - 38.814 tons (increase of 0.3% compared to 2017) and in 2019 - 37.500 tons (decrease of 3.4% compared to 2018) (due to Agreement between OPEC and Non OPEC oil producing countries from 2017 with cutting the oil production. 35 thousand barrel per day for Azerbaijan), according to the data of SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic).","Nigar, Nur-Mammadova","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Issues+and+Analysis+of+Risk+Management+on+an+Example+of+the+Azerbaijani+Oil+of+Azeri+Light+in+the+Conditions+of+Uncertainty+and+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research; 10:206-213, 2021.; Publication details: Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research; 10:206-213, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22633,""
"The impacts of Covid-19 on foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong","This paper is to inform the recent situations of work by the foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Hong Kong through the lens of Covid-19. Through the interviews with seven informants â€” two employers and five FDWs, stories describing the changes in their working conditions, rights and entitlement, and the contextual environment related to the impacts of Covid-19 were collected. They were analysed through three theoretical tools â€” visibility/invisibility, mobility/immobility, and work boundary. The findings show that under the Covid-19 crisis, the FDWs experienced more hardships and struggles in both the home country and host country. The paradoxes of visibility/invisibility and mobility/immobility together with blurred work boundary were found in their experience of work, rights and entitlement, and the contextual environment. On one hand, the employersâ€™ power of controlling FDWs has increased, but the agency to resist by the FDWs has decreased making them to turn to more passive means of resistance which could harm the FDWsâ€™ physical and mental health and wellbeing.","May, Wong Mei Ling","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impacts+of+Covid-19+on+foreign+domestic+workers+in+Hong+Kong","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Asian Journal of Business Ethics;: 1-14, 2021.; Publication details: Asian Journal of Business Ethics;: 1-14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22634,""

"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS","Objectives: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Malaysian university and pre-university students, especially after the shift to online academic activities, following almost one year of experiencing the pandemic Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Malaysian preuniversity and university students, nationwide, using perceived stress scale-10 questionnaire and another validated 11-construct questionnaire. Key findings: The online questionnaires were filled out by 383 Malaysian pre-university and university students. About 40% of the respondents reported moderate to severe level of loneliness and social isolation. There was a significant correlation between suicidal thoughts and the social isolation. The prevalence of moderate to severe suicidal thoughts (14% of the respondents) was more than the reported prevalence before COVID-19 pandemic. The residential state, gender and ethnicity of the respondents did not show an association with depressive and suicidal thoughts of the respondents. Conclusion: Loneliness and feeling social isolation were the most prevalent problems, as reported by the students. Suicidal Thoughts are more prevalent, compared to pre-COVID-19 reports. The educators and institution managers must seek for appropriate methods to address the critical condition.","Keshavarzi, F.; Megan, C.; Sin, C. K.; Wei, C. C.; Ming, C. C.; Yin, C. W.

"Development of a minority stress preventive intervention for sexual and gender minority youth and young adults","Mental health disparities amongst sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals are spurred by exposure to minority stressors and sustained by mediators of problems with emotion regulation, social support, and cognitive processes. Emerging clinical research suggests empirically supported behavioral health treatments can be culturally adapted to address these mental health disparities, however less work has focused on the prevention of symptoms. The present study developed a brief preventive intervention targeting mediators of the minority stress model for SGM youth and young adults aged 17 to 26. Focus groups with 8 SGM participants informed development to ensure the content and delivery of the intervention was culturally appropriate. Intervention components included psychoeducation on the minority stress model, skills for emotion regulation, compiling lists of local affirming resources, and practice of cognitive restructuring techniques with internalized stigma examples. Twenty-six participants, in 4 cohorts, received the 90 minute intervention in a multiple baseline design trial to establish preliminary feasibility and efficacy. Participants completed measures of internalizing symptoms, emotion regulation, social support, stress appraisal, and internalized stigma every 2 weeks for 5 time-points. Participants rated the intervention as successful, logical, and appropriate for SGM youth and young adults. Limited change was seen in outcome measures at follow-up time-points. Onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes to the intervention delivery mode, and along with factors such as limited dosing, may explain lack of improvement on distal outcome measures. With further refinement, this brief preventive intervention can easily be delivered to SGM youth and young adults to provide skills and resources for coping with minority stress.

"Role of indian herbs in Boosting Immunity","The world today is badly affected with the deadly Corona virus. Boosting the body's immunity has gained a sudden and intense attention globally as people with better immune are reported to be less affected. Apart from the immunity boosting preparations that people consume, a major role has been played by food in building a better immune mechanism of the body. Protection from different viral and bacterial infections is a vital role of strong immunity. Presently many herbs are being used in different ailments and this trend is increasing rapidly. Many herbs that we use in our day-to-day lives are helpful in boosting the immunity thus helpful in fighting infections. The pungent-smelling herb Garlic, has antibiotic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobialproperties and is found to have some compounds that boost the disease-fighting response of some particular white blood cells when they encounter viruses. The extracts or powder of leaves and roots of Ashwagandha can reduce blood sugar and cortisol levels, symptoms of depression and helps in increasing strength and muscle mass. Tulsi is an immunity boosting herb, which helps in relieving many lung-related diseases and is also beneficial in cramping, gastric disorders, reducing sugar, controlling blood pressure and skin-related problems. Amla is full of antioxidants primarily Vitamin C that is helpful in detoxifying the entire organ system for better health and immunity. Neem is another antimicrobial herb whose every part is therapeutic in nature. With detoxification effect on the body it also has the capability to fight fungus, viruses and bacteria. The active compound of turmeric;curcumin found to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Ginger has antibacterial properties. Gingerol is a phenolic anti-inflammatory compound found in ginger that helps in relaxing blood vessels and functions as natural blood thinner. Many other herbs like Cinnamon, Giloy, Black pepper, Cloves have important roles in boosting immunity.

"Effects of escalating schedules of reinforcement, self-monitoring and incremental goal setting on the number of daily steps taken during the COVID-19 pandemic","Behavioral principles, specifically reinforcement systems, utilize contingencies within the environment to help modify behavior. By changing contingencies that are connected to specific behaviors, the behaviors are increased or decreased. These principles can be applied to the behavior of physical activity and in turn have an impact on a person's weight and overall health. One of the world's leading risk factors for death, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2017) is low levels of physical activity. Inactivity can have multiple side effects such as obesity, increased depression, diabetes, greater chance of cardiovascular disease and cancer which all increase the likelihood of death. Obesity in America, within the last decade, has risen to epidemic levels. This study assessed the effects of an intervention package that consisted of an escalating reinforcement schedule, self-monitoring and incremental goal setting on the average number of daily steps taken by females over the age of 40 during the COVID-10 pandemic. A changing criterion design with a reversal phase was arranged to evaluate the effects of the intervention package on the average number of steps taken by each participant as recorded by an Apple Watch. The results indicate that the average number of daily steps taken gradually increased for three of the four participants during each phase of the project. While no significant changes were noted in weight or BMI scores for any of the participants, this research demonstrated the effective use of the treatment package to gradually increase the average number of daily steps taken over a period of 6 weeks. The implications for society as a whole include extending the literature to make advances toward societal change, reducing health risks, and increasing not only physical activity but also the ability to access reinforcement and other socially significant activities that are inaccessible at lower levels of activity.

"COMPARISON OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS OF HOSPITALIZED COVID-19 PATIENTS, INDIVIDUALS UNDER QUARANTINE, AND HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS OF SOCIETY IN THE PANDEMIC","Aim: This study aimed to find out which group is most affected by psychological distress during the pandemic and determination of MHL level. Methods: This is cross sectional study. Research sample consisted of 814 voluntary people. The study used descriptive data form, Kessler psychological distress scale and mental health literacy scale. Before the study was conducted, permission was obtained from necessary institutions and then research ethics committee approval was obtained. Also, individuals who were contacted through online platforms were informed about the study and provided informed consent forms by clicking ""yes"" option which showed their voluntary participation. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, analysis of variance, and Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests. To detect correlations, the correlation and regression analyses were used. Results: The study results showed that 28% of the participants had diagnosable psychological distress (30-50) and individuals who received COVID-19 treatment at hospital had the highest median score (30). The mental health literacy of the participants was low (106) and the lowest scores belonged to individuals under treatment of COVID-19 at hospital. The highest psychological distress was in the Black Sea region and the lowest mental health literacy was in Southeastern Anatolia region. There was a significant very weak positive correlation between psychological distress scale and mental health literacy. Conclusion: Individuals who had COVID-19 disease had high psychological distress and low mental health literacy. After the pandemic, the community should be screened for mental illnesses and mental health literacy training should be organized to improve mental health. Nurses need to use their collaborative and advocacy roles regarding mental evaluation, providing consultancy and treatment during nursing care to patients with COVID-19 importance.","Akgun, S.; Kesgin, M.

"COVID-19 dimensions are related to depression and anxiety among US college students: Findings from the Healthy Minds Survey 2020","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about tremendous social and economic turmoil, which has been associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study (Fall Semester Cohort 2020), a non-probability sample of students across multiple colleges who completed an online survey between September - December 2020. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the associations between COVID-19 dimensions (concern, racial/ethnic discrimination, financial distress, infection, illness of loved one, death of loved one, caregiving) and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety), adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and international student status. RESULTS: Nearly a fifth of the sample reported moderately severe or severe depression, and nearly a third reported moderately severe or severe anxiety over the past two weeks. When accounting for all COVID-19 dimensions in the same model, COVID-19 concern, racial/ethnic discrimination, financial distress, and infection were significantly associated with moderately severe or severe depression; COVID-19 concern, financial distress, and infection were significantly associated with moderately severe or severe anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may have shaped mental health through a range of potential social and environmental dimensions. Interventions are required that consider multiple dimensions of COVID-19 to improve mental health during and after the pandemic.","Oh, Hans; Marinovich, Caitlin; Rajkumar, Ravi; Besecker, Megan; Zhou, Sasha; Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Smith, Lee","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.121","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;292: 270-275, 2021 09 01.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;292: 270-275, 2021 09 01.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Anxiety/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22647,""
"Clinical applications of mesenchymal stromal cell-based therapies for pulmonary diseases: An Update and Concise Review","Lung disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and death worldwide. For many disease conditions, no effective and curative treatment options are available. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapy is one of the cutting-edge topics in medical research today. It offers a novel and promising therapeutic option for various acute and chronic lung diseases due to its potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities, bacterial clearance, tissue regeneration, and proangiogenic and antifibrotic properties, which rely on both cell-to-cell contact and paracrine mechanisms. This review covers the sources and therapeutic potential of MSCs. In particular, a total of 110 MSC-based clinical applications, either completed clinical trials with safety and early efficacy results reported or ongoing worldwide clinical trials of pulmonary diseases, are systematically summarized following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, including acute/viral pulmonary disease, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), interstitial lung diseases (ILD), chronic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and lung cancer. The results of recent clinical studies suggest that MSCs are a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of lung diseases. Nevertheless, large-scale clinical trials and evaluation of long-term effects are necessary in further studies.","Chen, Xiaobo; Wang, Feng; Huang, Zhiwei; Wu, Yan; Geng, Jie; Wang, Yuliang","https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ijms.59218","","Country: AU; AUSTRÃLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Med Sci;18(13): 2849-2870, 2021.; Publication details: Int J Med Sci;18(13): 2849-2870, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22648,""

"Problematic Internet Use Associated with Symptomatic Dry Eye Disease in Medical Students from Peru","Purpose: Dry eye is a multifactorial ocular surface disease (DED) characterized by a loss of tear film homeostasis, which is widely associated with alterations in mental health. Problematic internet use (PIU) is defined as the feeling of concern about using this tool irresistibly, for longer periods than usual, accompanied by anguish that results from not doing so without reaching mania or hypomania behaviors. Both PIU and DED present a theoretical link; however, there are no published studies that report its relationship with problematic internet use. Therefore, this study aims to determine the association between PIU and symptomatic DED in Peruvian medical students. Patients and Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study that included human medical students from Peru. For the measurement of main variables, the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) were used. To study their relationship, the Poisson regression analysis was used, we consider a p-value <0.05 as significant. Results: Data from 844 medical students were analyzed, 35.7% male and 64.3% female, with an average age of 21.8 Â± 3.3 years. Likewise, the prevalence of symptomatic DED was 70.9%, and the internet's controlled use was 85.3%. In the analysis adjusted for symptomatic DED, the men showed significant differences in the controlled use of the internet (p <0.003), of which those who had PIU, 50% had severe symptomatic DED, as well as 80% of those addicted to the internet. The adjusted model showed that the PIU increases the prevalence of symptomatic DED in men (PR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06-1.29); however, in women, no association was found between both variables. Conclusion: PIU and symptomatic DED showed a significant association in male medical students from Peru.","Condori-Meza, I Benjamin; DÃ¡vila-Cabanillas, L Alessandra; Challapa-Mamani, Mabel R; Pinedo-Soria, Antony; Torres, Renato R; Yalle, Joel; Rojas-Humpire, Ricardo; Huancahuire-Vega, SalomÃ³n","https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S334156","","Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÃ‚NDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Clin Ophthalmol;15: 4357-4365, 2021.; Publication details: Clin Ophthalmol;15: 4357-4365, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22650,""

"Myalgia as a symptom at hospital admission by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is associated with persistent musculoskeletal pain as long-term post-COVID sequelae: a case-control study","ABSTRACT: This study investigated the association between COVID-related myalgia experienced by patients at hospital admission and the presence of post-COVID symptoms. A case-control study including patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 between February 20 and May 31, 2020, was conducted. Patients reporting myalgia and patients without myalgia at hospital admission were scheduled for a telephone interview 7 months after hospital discharge. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. A list of post-COVID symptoms with attention to musculoskeletal pain was evaluated. Anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were likewise assessed. From a total of 1200 hospitalised patients with COVID-19, 369 with and 369 without myalgia at hospital admission were assessed 7.2 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. A greater proportion (P = 0.03) of patients with myalgia at hospital admission (20%) showed &#8805;3 post-COVID symptoms when compared with individuals without myalgia (13%). A higher proportion of patients presenting myalgia (odds Rratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.90) exhibited musculoskeletal post-COVID pain when compared to those without myalgia. The prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain in the total sample was 38%. Fifty percent of individuals with preexisting musculoskeletal pain experienced a worsening of their symptoms after COVID-19. No differences in fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety/depressive levels, or sleep quality were observed between myalgia and nonmyalgia groups. The presence of myalgia at hospital admission was associated with preexisting history of musculoskeletal pain (OR 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.10-2.40). In conclusion, myalgia at the acute phase was associated with musculoskeletal pain as long-term post-COVID sequelae. In addition, half of the patients with preexisting pain conditions experienced a persistent exacerbation of their previous syndromes.","FernÃ¡ndez-de-Las-PeÃ±as, CÃ©sar; RodrÃ­guez-JimÃ©nez, Jorge; Fuensalida-Novo, Stella; Palacios-CeÃ±a, MarÃ­a; GÃ³mez-Mayordomo, VÃ­ctor; Florencio, Lidiane L; HernÃ¡ndez-Barrera, ValentÃ­n; Arendt-Nielsen, Lars","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002306","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pain;2021 Apr 08.; Publication details: Pain;2021 Apr 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22653,""

"Factors related to autonomy among Lebanese women: a web-based cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: Autonomy involves making independent decisions and creating lasting and equitable power relationships within families. Many factors, dependent on both the woman and her partner, can influence self-dependence, and subsequent decision-making, exerting a protective or triggering effect on its development. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to assess autonomy in a sample of Lebanese women. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association between socioeconomic status, psychological factors, and autonomy. METHODS: A web based cross-sectional online study was conducted between June 8 and August 1, 2020. The questionnaire developed on Google Forms was distributed through social media and WhatsApp groups, using the snowball technique. The Women's Autonomy Index (WAI) was created using three items adapted from a previous study. In addition, the Composite Abuse Scale Revised-Short Form (CASR-SF) was used to assess three domains of abuse: physical, sexual, and psychological. The Perceived stress scale short version to measure stress perception, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale to measure anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25 was used for data analysis. Linear regressions were performed, taking the Women's Autonomy Index as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 369 Lebanese women. University education level (beta = 1.263), alcohol consumption (beta = 0.586), intermediate income level (beta = 0.702), high income (beta = 0.911), employment (beta = 0.559), and older age (beta = 0.033) were significantly associated with higher WAI. Living in South Lebanon (beta = - 0.668) and being Druze (beta = - 323) were associated with lower WAI. Significantly higher mean scores of anxiety and perceived stress were found among women with low autonomy. CONCLUSION: In Lebanon, the autonomy of women depends on several personal and partner-related characteristics (education, socioeconomic status, age), in addition to the cultural (geographic and religious) environment. Furthermore, low autonomy is associated with higher perceived stress and anxiety and probable depression and domestic abuse.","Bou Malhab, Sandrella; Sacre, Hala; Malaeb, Diana; Lahoud, Nathalie; Khachman, Dalia; Azzi, Joelle; Haddad, Chadia; Salameh, Pascale","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01501-3","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Womens Health;21(1): 369, 2021 Oct 20.; Publication details: BMC Womens Health;21(1): 369, 2021 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22655,""
"Occupational stress among farm and ranch operators in the midwestern United States","BACKGROUND: This study used surveillance data from 2018 and 2020 to test the stability of work-related strain symptoms (high stress, sleep deprivation, exhaustion) with demographic factors, work characteristics, and musculoskeletal symptoms among farm and ranch operators in seven midwestern states of the United States. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted among farm and ranch operators in 2018 (nÂ = 4423) and 2020 (nÂ = 3492). Operators were asked whether, in the past 12 months, they experienced extended work periods that resulted in high stress levels, sleep deprivation, exhaustion/fatigue, or other work-related strain symptoms. Covariates included personal and demographic factors, work characteristics, number of injuries, work-related health conditions, and exposures on the operation. Summary statistics were tabulated for explanatory and outcome variables. The classification (decision) tree approach was used to assess what variables would best separate operators with and without reported strain symptoms, based on a set of explanatory variables. Regularized regression was used to generate effect estimates between the work strain variables and explanatory variables. RESULTS: High stress level, sleep deprivation, and exhaustion were reported more frequently in 2018 than 2020. The classification tree reproduced the 2018 model using 2020 data with approximately 80% accuracy. The mean number of reported MSD symptoms increased slightly from 1.23 in 2018 to 1.41 in 2020. Older age, more time spent in farm work, higher gross farm income (GFI), and MSD symptoms in six body regions (ankles/feet, knees, lower back, neck, shoulders, wrists/hands) were associated with all three work strain symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain and discomfort was a strong predictor for stress, sleep deprivation, and exhaustion among farmers and ranchers. This finding indicates that reducing MSD pain and discomfort is beneficial for both physical and mental health.","Chengane, Sabrine; Beseler, Cheryl L; Duysen, Ellen G; Rautiainen, Risto H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12053-4","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 2076, 2021 Nov 12.; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 2076, 2021 Nov 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22656,""
"Risk factors for the frequent attendance of older patients at community health service centers in China: a cross-sectional study based on stratified sampling","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of frequent attenders (FAs) among older patients in Shanghai, China, and explore the associated factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in six community health service centers in Shanghai, China, from August to December 2018 based on stratified sampling. On the basis of our preliminary study, FAs were defined as those attending at least four consultations in a month. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the clinicodemographic data of the participants. Social support, pain severity, depression, and anxiety were evaluated using the Social Support Revalued Scale, six-point Behavioral Rating Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, respectively. RESULTS: This study included 619 patients aged > 60 years. Among these patients, 155 (25%) were FAs to a community health service center, 366 (59.1%) had 1 or 2 chronic diseases, 179 (28.9%) had &#8805;3 chronic diseases, 313 (50.4%) opted for a family doctor service, and 537 (86.8%) chose a community health service center for the first consultation. The following were identified as independent risk factors for frequent attendance: widowed status, unmarried status, the presence of > 3 chronic diseases, first consultation at a community health service center, high medical expenses, frequent attendance of the spouses, long-term medication, the use of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine services, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: This study summarizes the characteristics of older FAs to community health service centers in China and identifies 10 risk factors significantly associated with frequent attendance.","Li, Nana; Shou, Juan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01575-w","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Fam Pract;22(1): 221, 2021 Nov 12.; Publication details: BMC Fam Pract;22(1): 221, 2021 Nov 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22657,""

"Comprehensive occupational health services for healthcare workers in Zimbabwe during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Healthcare workers are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In low- and middle- income countries, they may be particularly impacted by underfunded health systems, lack of personal protective equipment, challenging working conditions and barriers in accessing personal healthcare. In this cross-sectional study, occupational health screening was implemented at the largest public sector medical centre in Harare, Zimbabwe, during the ""first wave"" of the country's COVID-19 epidemic. Clients were voluntarily screened for symptoms of COVID-19, and if present, offered a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assay. In addition, measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and HbA1c, HIV and TB testing, and mental health screening using the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14) were offered. An interviewer-administered questionnaire ascertained client knowledge and experiences related to COVID-19. Between 27th July and 30th October 2020, 951 healthcare workers accessed the service; 210 (22%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 12 (5.7%) tested positive. Clients reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 which declined with time, and faced barriers including lack of resources for infection prevention and control. There was a high prevalence of largely undiagnosed non-communicable disease: 61% were overweight or obese, 34% had a blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above, 10% had an HbA1c diagnostic of diabetes, and 7% had an SSQ-14 score consistent with a common mental disorder. Overall 8% were HIV-positive, with 97% previously diagnosed and on treatment. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers mirrored the national epidemic curve. Implementation of comprehensive occupational health services during a pandemic was feasible, and uptake was high. Other comorbidities were highly prevalent, which may be risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are also important independent causes of morbidity and mortality. Healthcare workers are critical to combatting COVID-19; it is essential to support their physical and psychological wellbeing during the pandemic and beyond.","Kavenga, Rickman, Chingono, Taruvinga, Marembo, Manasa, Marambire, McHugh, Gregson, Bandason, Redzo, Maunganidze, Magure, Ndhlovu, Mujuru, Rusakaniko, Manangazira, Ferrand, Kranzer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260261","20211123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22659,""
"Prevalence and determinants of healthcare avoidance during the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based cross-sectional study","During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of consultations and diagnoses in primary care and referrals to specialist care declined substantially compared to prepandemic levels. Beyond deferral of elective non-COVID-19 care by healthcare providers, it is unclear to what extent healthcare avoidance by community-dwelling individuals contributed to this decline in routine healthcare utilisation. Moreover, it is uncertain which specific symptoms were left unheeded by patients and which determinants predispose to healthcare avoidance in the general population. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed prevalence of healthcare avoidance during the pandemic from a patient perspective, including symptoms that were left unheeded, as well as determinants of healthcare avoidance. On April 20, 2020, a paper COVID-19 survey addressing healthcare utilisation, socioeconomic factors, mental and physical health, medication use, and COVID-19-specific symptoms was sent out to 8,732 participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study (response rate 73%). All questionnaires were returned before July 10, 2020. By hand, prevalence of healthcare avoidance was subsequently verified through free text analysis of medical records of general practitioners. Odds ratios (ORs) for avoidance were determined using logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and history of chronic diseases. We found that 1,142 of 5,656 included participants (20.2%) reported having avoided healthcare. Of those, 414 participants (36.3%) reported symptoms that potentially warranted urgent evaluation, including limb weakness (13.6%), palpitations (10.8%), and chest pain (10.2%). Determinants related to avoidance were older age (adjusted OR 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.21]), female sex (1.58 [1.38 to 1.82]), low educational level (primary education versus higher vocational/university 1.21 [1.01 to 1.46), poor self-appreciated health (per level decrease 2.00 [1.80 to 2.22]), unemployment (versus employed 2.29 [1.54 to 3.39]), smoking (1.34 [1.08 to 1.65]), concern about contracting COVID-19 (per level increase 1.28 [1.19 to 1.38]) and symptoms of depression (per point increase 1.13 [1.11 to 1.14]) and anxiety (per point increase 1.16 [1.14 to 1.18]). Study limitations included uncertainty about (perceived) severity of the reported symptoms and potentially limited generalisability given the ethnically homogeneous study population. In this population-based cross-sectional study, 1 in 5 individuals avoided healthcare during lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic, often for potentially urgent symptoms. Healthcare avoidance was strongly associated with female sex, fragile self-appreciated health, and high levels of depression and anxiety. These results emphasise the need for targeted public education urging these vulnerable patients to timely seek medical care for their symptoms to mitigate major health consequences.","Splinter, Velek, Ikram, Kieboom, Peeters, Bindels, Ikram, Wolters, Leening, de Schepper, Licher","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003854","20211123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22660,""
"The Road to Value Demands a Smarter Approach to Risk","As healthcare nears year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and health systems should consider accepting significant responsibility for the total cost of care from all sources, per covered life, over time. One place to start: Reduce avoidable spending on chronic conditions, which, combined with mental health conditions, account for most healthcare expenditures. This shift will necessitate investments that strengthen the ability to identify at-risk populations and react in ways that help avoid complications and reduce unnecessary costs.Even before the pandemic, it was clear that there were missed opportunities to reduce costs of care. Failures in care coordination contributed to billions of dollars in waste each year. Now, as payers explore innovative risk-based arrangements for addressing the impacts of social determinants of health and delayed care on health outcomes, healthcare providers should seek opportunities to partner with payers in developing shared-risk approaches to patient engagement and chronic condition management. Steps toward designing a model for risk innovation include rewarding physicians and clinicians for managing the total cost of care, involving physicians in discussions around acceptable levels of risk in value-based contracts, ensuring that the organization's cost accounting approach meets its strategic needs, investing in actuaries to study data that can identify rising-risk patients, and exploring innovative partnerships for funding the infrastructure for value.","Fifer","https://doi.org/10.1097/HAP.0000000000000129","20211123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22661,""
"Current impact and future consequences of the pandemic on children's and adolescents' health","There is plenty bibliography about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental and social health of children, adolescents, and youth. A very high percentage of this population developed emotional symptoms and their levels of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation increased considerably. The adults who were responsible for generating a support network were impacted and suffered emotional symptoms and job and economic uncertainty. In many children, without a supportive context, exposure to adverse experiences increased, so the pandemic may be considered an adverse experience itself. The future effect of such unfavorable experience on childhood and how family and social support may help to reduce stress through the development of resilience were reviewed. As citizens and health care providers, our responsibility is to reflect, discuss, and develop strategies to mitigate such damage that may have severe consequences on the mental and physical health of children and adults.

"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on people with HIV","The COVID-19 pandemic materialized in 2020, the year the international community had expected to meet the interim targets to end AIDS by 2030. Forty years into the HIV pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic challenges the achievements made in HIV and may even reverse some of them. This article provides an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on people with, and at risk of, HIV infection. It addresses where the global response to HIV was expected to be by 2020, analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on HIV-related outcomes and reviews the impact of HIV on COVID-19 related outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the response to HIV infection through disruption of prevention, testing, and access to antiretroviral treatment, as well as on the management of long-term HIV and mental health. This negative impact has been unequal throughout the world and across populations and deepens inequities in health. HIV does not increase Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility once confounders are taken into account and inconsistencies are reported regarding its direct role on clinical severity. In post-COVID-19 scenarios, new models for HIV testing and care are likely to be consolidated.

"School Social Worker Voice during COVID-19 School Disruptions: A National Qualitative Analysis","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented impacts on our schools and society, requiring school social workers (SSWs) to attend to layered and cascading effects for students and their families. This study presents rich qualitative data from a national survey of SSWs about their personal and professional roles supporting students, families, and staff members as schools shifted to remote instruction. Findings indicate that SSWs are highly concerned about a lack of basic needs resources, including food, housing, and mental health support for students and families. SSWs highlighted the unequal effects of school closures for families without technology and Internet access as well as the difficulties providing services during the pandemic. Recovery policies should target resources to schools with the highest needs while prioritizing food, housing, mental health, and access to tools for online learning. SSWs also need additional and refined professional support to overcome their isolated roles in schools and bolster their ability to deliver online services effectively.","Capp, Watson, Astor, Kelly, Benbenishty","https://doi.org/10.1093/cs/cdab007","20211123","COVID-19; basic needs; national policy recommendations; school social worker role","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22664,""
"Pre-pandemic electrodermal activity predicts current COVID-related fears: household size during lockdown as a moderating factor","Despite the immense impact of COVID-19 on mental health, there is a lack of prospective studies examining physiological predictors of current risk factors. Moreover, although physiological processes evidently interact with socio-demographic factors to modulate individuals' response to a crisis, it remains largely unknown how these complex interactions shape people's mental responses to COVID-19. To fill these gaps of knowledge, we chose a potent physiological marker of distress - heightened baseline electrodermal activity (EDA) measured before the pandemic began - and hypothesized it would be related to greater COVID-related fears and worries as a function of individuals' household size. 185 individuals (71% women), who had participated in our lab studies 2-3Ã¢â‚¬â€°years ago, in which we assessed their baseline EDA, completed several questionnaires online, including assessments of their current fears regarding COVID. Participants also reported the number of people in their household, with whom they had been together during a lockdown which was taking place at the time. We used pre-pandemic EDA measures in combination with their household size to predict participants' current fears. Pre-pandemic EDA measures predicted current COVID-related fears and worries. Specifically for the EDA measure ""number of skin conductance responses"", we further found that the number of people in the household during the lockdown, moderated the abovementioned relationship, such that it occurred in individuals with average and larger households and not in those with small households. We provide a highly relevant and unique combination of physiological, socio-demographic, and psychological measures, which augments the potential to optimally target populations vulnerable to COVID-related distress, and subsequently offer them early mental health interventions.","Horesh, Milstein, Tomashin, Mayo, Gordon","https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2021.2006179","20211123","COVID-19 fears; Electrodermal activity; biopsychosocial perspective; household size; physiological arousal; sympathetic nervous system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22665,""
"Posttraumatic Stress Namong Pediatric Critical Care Physicians in the United States in Association with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patient Care Experiences","Posttraumatic stress among pediatric critical care physicians in the United States in association with coronavirus disease 2019 patient care experiences. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress (PTS) and its association with COVID-19 patient care experiences among pediatric critical care physicians. Our study was a cross-sectional study of pediatric critical care physicians in the United States. We measured PTS which included posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (SubPTSD) using validated PTSD Checklist- 5 survey tool. Association of PTS with COVID-19 patient care experiences was analyzed using regression analysis. Prevalence of PTS was noted in 120 among 294 pediatric critical care physicians (41%; 95% CI, 35-47%). The predominant symptoms were that of hyperarousal and feelings of negative cognition and mood. Among our physicians with PTS, 19% had PTSD and 81% had SubPTSD. Demographic and practice characteristics were not significant for increased PTS on regression analysis. Posttraumatic stress was significantly associated with physicians testing positive or taking time off for COVID-19 illness, self-isolation, fear of infecting their loved ones, families scared of being infected, feeling helpless, patients expressing fears of dying, having pre-existing depression, anxiety, or insomnia, working beyond comfort level of training and having thoughts of quitting (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Thoughts of quitting was associated with the highest significant increase in PTS scores (coefficient:11.643; 95% CI:8.551,14.735; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) followed by feeling of helplessness (coefficient:11.055; 95% CI: 8.484,13.624; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and need for additional medications for depression, anxiety and insomnia (coefficient: 10.980; 95% CI: 4.970, 16.990; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Posttraumatic stress is high in pediatric critical care physicians and is associated with various COVID-19 patient care experiences. Thoughts of quitting was associated with highest increase in posttraumatic stress score which could have major implications for the workforce in the future. Subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder should be recognized, and mental health issues of pediatric critical care physicians addressed.","Kalyanaraman, Sankar, Timpo, McQueen, Morparia, Bergel, Rosenblatt","https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211059385","20211123","coronavirus disease 2019; pandemic; pediatric critical care physician; posttraumatic stress; posttraumatic stress disorder; subthreshold","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22666,""
"A year in perspective: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on engagement with Jigsaw youth mental health services","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges for young people and youth mental health services. To address a gap in knowledge about the impact of the pandemic and associated restrictions on youth mental health services, this paper examined the nature of young people's engagement with Jigsaw's brief intervention service during the pandemic. Data gathered from young people engaging with Jigsaw's brief intervention service in the 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the official declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6161), and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months prior (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8665) were examined. There were less referrals to Jigsaw during the pandemic, especially during lockdown periods, but this rebounded when public health restrictions were eased. A higher proportion of females (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and 12-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°year olds (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) were referred during the pandemic period. There was an increase in the proportion of young people who presented with anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and sleep changes (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Although 12-16Ã¢â‚¬â€°year olds reported significantly higher levels of distress during the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), the effect size was small. Young people reported high levels of satisfaction with the new phone/video modes of support offered by Jigsaw, and the overall attendance rate improved during the pandemic period. The impact of COVID-19 on young people's mental health needs to be considered as a priority.

"The impact of lockdown stress and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among university students in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a shutdown of universities in Germany. In a longitudinal design, we compared mental health (depression, anxiety, somatic complaints) of university students in Germany before (June to August 2019) and in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020) and determined the impact of pandemic-related stress and loneliness on students' mental health in self-report online surveys. We investigated 443 participants (mean age 22.8Ã‚Â years), among them 77% female, and 10.4% medical students. A small increase of depression mean scores was observed (F(1,420)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.21; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.023), anxiety and somatic complaints have not significantly changed. There was a medium increase in loneliness from pre-pandemic scores to the pandemic situation (F(1,423)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30.56; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Analyzed with regression analyses, current loneliness and pre-pandemic distress represented the strongest associations with mental health during the pandemic.

"The (a)typical burden of COVID-19 pandemic scenario in Autism Spectrum Disorder","Psychological and mental health consequences of large-scale anti-contagion policies are assuming strong relevance in the COVID-19 pandemic. We proposed a specific focus on a large sample of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), developing an ad hoc instrument to investigate changes occurred in specific (sub-)domains during a period of national lockdown (Italy). Our questionnaire, named AutiStress, is both context-specific (being set in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario) and condition-specific (being structured taking into account the autistic functioning peculiarities in the paediatric age). An age- and gender-matched group of neurotypical (TD) controls was also provided. As expected, the severe lockdown policies had a general negative impact both on ASD and TD children, reflecting the obvious burden of the pandemic situation. However, our findings also indicate that children with ASD experienced more positive changes than TD ones. Noteworthy, we report a thought-provoking double dissociation in the context-specific predictor (i.e., accessibility to private outdoor spaces), indicating that it impacts differently on the two groups. Focusing on the ASD group, results suggest a condition-specific impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on core autistic (sub-)domains. Taken together, our data call for a multi-layered, context- and condition-specific analysis of the pandemic burden beyond any oversimplification.","Fumagalli, Nicoli, Villa, Riva, Vicovaro, Casartelli","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-01907-x","20211123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22670,""
"What gets resident physicians stressed and how would they prefer to be supported? A best-worst scaling study","Physician burnout has severe consequences on clinician well-being. Residents face numerous work-stressors that can contribute to burnout; however, given specialty variation in work-stress, it is difficult to identify systemic stressors and implement effective burnout interventions on an institutional level. Assessing resident preferences by specialty for common wellness interventions could also contribute to improved efficacy. This cross-sectional study used best-worst scaling (BWS), a type of discrete choice modelling, to explore how 267 residents across nine specialties (anaesthesiology, emergency medicine, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynaecology, pathology, psychiatry, radiology and surgery) prioritised 16 work-stressors and 4 wellness interventions at a large academic medical centre during the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2020). Top-ranked stressors were work-life integration and electronic health record documentation. Therapy (63%, selected as 'would realistically consider intervention') and coaching (58%) were the most preferred wellness supports in comparison to group-based peer support (20%) and individual peer support (22%). Pathology, psychiatry and OBGYN specialties were most willing to consider all intervention options, with emergency medicine and internal medicine specialties least willing to consider intervention options. BWS can identify relative differences in surveyed stressors, allowing for the generation of specialty-specific stressor rankings and preferences for specific wellness interventions that can be used to drive institution-wide changes to improve clinician wellness. BWS surveys are a potential methodology for clinician wellness programmes to gather specific information on preferences to determine best practices for resident wellness.","Wu, Parris, Scarella, Tibbles, Torous, Hill","https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-140719","20211123","health economics; human resource management; medical education &amp; training; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22671,""

Knowledge gaps are particularly pronounced for urban refugees who experience poverty, overcrowded living conditions and poor sanitation access that constrain the ability to practise COVID-19 mitigation strategies such as physical distancing and frequent hand washing. With over 1.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°million refugees, Uganda is sub-Saharan Africa's largest refugee hosting nation. More than 90Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 of Uganda's refugees live in Kampala, most in informal settlements, and 27% are aged 15-24 years old.

"Clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study among child and adolescent psychiatrists across the world","The COVID-19 pandemic has directly impacted the field of child and adolescent psychiatry, affecting all aspects of the lives of children and their families and increasing their risk of distress and mental health issues, especially among children with preexisting psychiatric disorders. Child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) across the world have had to adapt their practice, due to lockdown and social distancing measures. This study aimed to explore how CAPs experienced their clinical practice in these singular conditions. This exploratory international qualitative study used the Inductive Process to analyse the Structure of lived Experience (IPSE) approach, which is a five-stage inductive process used to explore the lived experience of participants in depth and to analyze their structure of lived experience. This study took place from March through July 2020 through individual in-depth video interviews. The sample size was determined according to the principles of theoretical sufficiency. 39 CAPs from 26 countries participated (age range 32-70Ã‚Â years; 23 women). Data analysis produced a structure of lived experience comprising three central axes of experience: (1) lost in space, lost in time, describing CAPs' experience of disorganization of their clinical practice in the dimensions of lived time and lived space, (2) the body-of CAPs and patients-underlining their disconcerting experience of both sensory aspects and the non-embodied encounter during clinical practice, and (3) unpleasant emotions, with angst and loneliness the two main feelings coloring their clinical practice experience. This analysis of the structure of lived experience of CAPs went beyond the sole context of the pandemic and revealed key aspects of what usually organizes CAP clinical practice. It identified two blind spots or conceptual voids within the child and adolescent psychiatry field: first, the intrinsic therapeutic function of a CAP clinical practice and, second, the important diagnostic and therapeutic function of the embodied encounter during CAP consultations. Beyond the context of COVID-19, further research should investigate these aspects to better define what a CAP does in practice and to increase both attractiveness and recruitment in this specialty.","Sibeoni, Manolios, Costa-Drolon, Meunier, Verneuil, Revah-Levy","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00417-y","20211123","COVID-19; Child psychiatrists; Clinical practice; Qualitative methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22674,""

We recruited 1827 Chinese adolescents (M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.16Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.23Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 53.3% female) to participate a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, including the scales of cultural tightness, risk perception of COVID-19 pandemic, perceived protection efficacy, anxiety and depression. A latent moderated structural equations model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects of risk perception regarding COVID-19, cultural tightness and perceived protection efficacy on psychological disorders. The results showed that greater risk perception of COVID-19 predicted greater psychological disorders, however cultural tightness moderated this positive relationship. The increase in psychological disorders with risk perception regarding COVID-19 was less pronounced among people who lived in tighter cultural areas. In addition, this moderating effect of cultural tightness was further mediated by perceived protection efficacy; that is, tight culture protects against psychological disorders by enhancing perceived protection efficacy. This study enriched the theoretical framework of cultural tightness and indicated its importance in the field of mental health and health policies. It also emphasized the importance of tight culture as a protective factor against psychological disorders in case of COVID-19 outbreaks, providing valuable practical insight into psychological prevention for COVID-19 outbreaks.","Dong, Chen, Zong, Zhang, Gu, Feng, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12161-1","20211123","COVID-19; Cultural tightness; Perceived protection efficacy; Psychological disorders; Risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22675,""

"The role of anxiety in mediating the relationship between information consumption and COVID-19 protective behaviours","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about an 'infodemic', with information and misinformation being spread across multiple channels and mediums. Information consumption has also been associated with increased anxiety throughout the pandemic. Thus, the present study investigates the mediating role of state anxiety on the relationship between information consumption (defined as mean frequency of information consumption multiplied by number of information sources) and COVID-19 protective behaviours. We compare results across Australian and United States samples and account for personal risk perception and belief in misinformation about COVID-19. Cross-sectional data collected between 28 and 30 April 2020 were analysed using Bayesian structural equation modelling among participants from Australia (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 201), and the United States (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 306). State anxiety scores were above the conventional clinical cut-off. Information consumption was positively associated with state anxiety, personal risk perception, and COVID-19 protective behaviours in the Australian and the United States samples. Additionally, the relationship between information consumption and COVID-19 protective behaviours was positively mediated by state anxiety in both nations, suggesting some functional benefits of anxiety. Differences in risk perception and belief in misinformation existed between the Australian and United States sample. Findings provide support for current guidance from organisations such as the WHO, APA, and APS on limiting information consumption to reduce anxiety. To effectively communicate critical public health messaging while minimising potential burdens on mental health, there is a need to develop and test interventions that assist people in calibrating the extent and nature of their information consumption.","van Antwerpen, Turnbull, Searston","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.2008994","20211123","COVID-19; anxiety; infodemic; misinformation; protective behaviours","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-24","",22677,""
