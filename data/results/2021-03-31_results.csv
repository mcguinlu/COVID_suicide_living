"COVID-19 and Mental Health: Should We Expect an Increase in Disability?","Disability due to mental health disorders has been increasing in many countries over the past years. The COVID-19 pandemic may worsen this trend because of 3 different, and at times overlapping, pathways. This article describes each pathway, and by drawing on the experience of previous coronavirus epidemics and recent recessions, attempts to estimate the likelihood that claims due to mental health disorders will increase.","Meagher","https://doi.org/10.17849/insm-49-1-1-8.1","20210330","COVID-19; coronavirus pandemic; disability insurance.; mental health; neuropsychiatric manifestations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12497,""
"A Wearable Tele-Health System towards Monitoring COVID-19 and Chronic Diseases","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic since early 2020. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already caused more than two million deaths worldwide and affected people's physical and mental health. COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are generally required to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms at least for 14 days in the case the disease turns towards severe complications. Here, we overviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the patients' general health with a focus on their cardiovascular, respiratory and mental health, and investigated several existing patient monitoring systems. We addressed the limitations of these systems and proposed a wearable telehealth solution for monitoring a set of physiological parameters that are critical for COVID-19 patients such as body temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and cough. This physiological information can be further combined to potentially estimate the lung function using artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor fusion techniques. The prototype, which includes the hardware and a smartphone app, showed promising results with performance comparable to or better than similar commercial devices, thus potentially making the proposed system an ideal wearable solution for long-term monitoring of COVID-19 patients and other chronic diseases.","Jiang, Majumder, Subramaniam, Li, Khedri, Monday, Abolghasemian, Satia, Deen","https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2021.3069815","20210330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12498,""
"Job loss and mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown: Evidence from South Africa","Existing literature on how employment loss affects depression has struggled to address potential endogeneity bias caused by reverse causality. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment because the source of unemployment is very likely to be exogenous to the individual. This study assessed the effect of job loss and job furlough on the mental health of individuals in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data for the study came from the first and second waves of the national survey, the National Income Dynamics-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), conducted during May-June and July-August 2020, respectively. The sample for NIDS-CRAM was drawn from an earlier national survey, conducted in 2017, which had collected data on mental health. Questions on depressive symptoms during the lockdown were asked in Wave 2 of NIDS-CRAM, using a 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 responses (0-6 on the discrete scale) were regrouped into four categories making the ordered logit regression model the most suited for assessing the impact of employment status on depressive symptoms. The study revealed that adults who retained paid employment during the COVID-19 lockdown had significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost employment. The benefits of employment also accumulated over time, underscoring the effect of unemployment duration on mental health. The analysis revealed no mental health benefits to being furloughed (on unpaid leave), but paid leave had a strong and significant positive effect on the mental health of adults. The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented job losses, which impaired mental wellbeing significantly. Health policy responses to the crisis therefore need to focus on both physical and mental health interventions.","Posel, Oyenubi, Kollamparambil","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249352","20210330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12499,""
"Disentangling the root causes of COVID-19 related increases in alcohol consumption","Recent studies suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased alcohol sales and alcohol related problems. This may be due to the synergistic effects of unemployment, stress from childcare or additional caregiving responsibilities, reduced social interactions and negative coping strategies. Weerakoon and colleagues set out to identify the most robust risk factors for alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and changes in drinking patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One-third of the sample reported consuming more alcohol after COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. In addition, each additional week spent at home under stay-at-home orders was increased the odds of binge drinking by 19%. Individuals who have been diagnosed with depression and were currently experiencing depressive symptoms were more than three times more likely (OR = 3.37) to have increased their alcohol consumption during COVID-19 compared to those with no history or symptoms of depression. Parents of children was associated with decreased COVID-19 related binge drinking (OR = .74). As many daily life factors have been altered due to the pandemic, a more holistic lifestyle disruption construct may help further investigate the long term effects of social isolation on alcohol use as the pandemic continues. Furthermore, the role of social support in mitigating COVID-19-related stress has yet to be examined and may be a protective factor against alcohol related problems. As stress continues, researchers should continue assessing the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 lockdowns with the goal of early identification for those at the highest risk of problematic alcohol use.","Molsberry, Maskaly, Reingle Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2021.1881532","20210330","Alcohol use; COVID-19; binge drinking; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12500,""
"Right Ventricular Strain Is Common in Intubated COVID-19 Patients and Does Not Reflect Severity of Respiratory Illness","Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is common and associated with worse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, RV dysfunction develops due to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, inflammation, and alveolar overdistension or atelectasis. Although similar pathogenic mechanisms may induce RV dysfunction in COVID-19, other COVID-19-specific pathology, such as pulmonary endothelialitis, thrombosis, or myocarditis, may also affect RV function. We quantified RV dysfunction by echocardiographic strain analysis and investigated its correlation with disease severity, ventilatory parameters, biomarkers, and imaging findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We determined RV free wall longitudinal strain (FWLS) in 32 patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. Demographics, comorbid conditions, ventilatory parameters, medications, and laboratory findings were extracted from the medical record. Chest imaging was assessed to determine the severity of lung disease and the presence of pulmonary embolism. Abnormal FWLS was present in 66% of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and was associated with higher lung compliance (39.6 vs 29.4 mL/cmH<sub>2</sub>O, <i>P</i> = 0.016), lower airway plateau pressures (21 vs 24 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, <i>P</i> = 0.043), lower tidal volume ventilation (5.74 vs 6.17 cc/kg, <i>P</i> = 0.031), and reduced left ventricular function. FWLS correlated negatively with age (r = -0.414, <i>P</i> = 0.018) and with serum troponin (r = 0.402, <i>P</i> = 0.034). Patients with abnormal RV strain did not exhibit decreased oxygenation or increased disease severity based on inflammatory markers, vasopressor requirements, or chest imaging findings. RV dysfunction is common among critically ill COVID-19 patients and is not related to abnormal lung mechanics or ventilatory pressures. Instead, patients with abnormal FWLS had more favorable lung compliance. RV dysfunction may be secondary to diffuse intravascular micro- and macro-thrombosis or direct myocardial damage.

"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Among COVID-19 Survivors at 3-Month Follow-up After Hospital Discharge","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe but treatable mental disorder that develops after a life-threatening traumatic event. Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) hospitalisation is a potentially traumatic experience, especially in severe cases. Furthermore, the unprecedented context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, with daily media bombardment about COVID-19 mortality, may have amplified life-threatening perception also in patients with moderate infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PTSD at 3-month follow-up in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection. In this cohort follow-up study conducted in a large Italian academic COVID-19 hospital, 115 recruited survivors were contacted by telephone 3 months after discharge to home care. The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 was administered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyse risk factors for the development of PTSD. A total of 10.4% of the sample received a PCL-5-based diagnosis of PTSD. Other 8.6% of the sample received a diagnosis of subthreshold PTSD, which leads to significant levels of distress and impairment. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that previous psychiatric diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7-78.6, p &lt; 0.001) and obesity (OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.4-857.9, p = 0.03) were risk factors for developing PTSD. Chronic pulmonary diseases approached significance as a risk factor (OR = 6.03, 95% CI: 1.0-37.1, p = 0.053). Male sex was a protective factor (OR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.0-0.041, p = 0.007). PTSD and subthreshold PTSD rates in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 are worrying. Female sex and pre-existing mental disorders are established risk factors for PTSD, while the prospective association with obesity needs further investigation. Clinicians treating COVID-19 should consider screening for PTSD at follow-up assessments in patients discharged from the hospital.","Tarsitani, Vassalini, Koukopoulos, Borrazzo, Alessi, Di Nicolantonio, Serra, Alessandri, Ceccarelli, Mastroianni, d'Ettorre","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06731-7","20210330","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; hospitalisation; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12502,""
"Coronavirus disease 2019 in the pediatric emergency department: unique considerations in preparation and response","Pediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) have experienced unique considerations throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We review the adaptations and challenges surrounding the preparation and response for pediatric emergency patients, with a specific focus on operational modifications, evolving personal protected equipment (PPE) needs, protected resuscitation responses, clinical characteristics in children, and the unintended effects on children and youth. COVID-19 has thus far proven to have a milder course in children, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic carriage or typical viral symptoms, to novel clinical entities such as 'COVID toes' and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), the latter associated with potentially significant morbidity. It has had an important effect on primary prevention, injury rates, reduced presentations for emergency care, and increased mental health, abuse and neglect rates in children and youth. PEDs have prepared successfully. The most significant adjustments have occurred with screening, testing, and consistent and effective use of PPE, along with protected responses to resuscitation, adaptations to maintain family-centered care, and technological advances in communication and virtual care. Simulation has been key to the successful implementation of many of these strategies. COVID-19 has pushed PEDs to rapidly adapt to evolving clinical and societal needs, with both resultant challenges and positive advances. Further experience and research will guide how in the face of a global pandemic we can further optimize the clinical and operational care of children and youth, ensure robust educational training programs, and maintain provider safety and wellness.","Beno, Ross, Principi","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOP.0000000000001010","20210330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12503,""
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on smoking consumption in a large representative sample of Italian adults","Italy is one of the first countries that imposed a nationwide stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 outbreak, inevitably resulting in changes in lifestyles and addictive behaviours. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of lockdown restrictions on smoking habits using data collected within the Lost in Italy project. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 6003 Italian adults aged 18-74 years. Study subjects were recruited from 27 April to 3 May 2020 and were asked to report changes in smoking habits before the lockdown and at the time of interview. During the lockdown, 5.5% of the overall sample quit or reduced smoking, but 9.0% of the sample started, relapsed smoking or increased their smoking intensity. In total, the lockdown increased cigarette consumption by 9.1%. An improvement in smoking habits was associated with younger age, occasional smoking and unemployment, whereas a worsening was mainly associated with mental distress. In particular, an increase in cigarette consumption during lockdown was more frequently reported among those with worsening quality of life (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.49 to 2.80), reduction in sleep quantity (OR: 2.29; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.71 to 3.07) and increased anxiety (OR: 1.83; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.38 to 2.43) and depressive symptoms (OR: 2.04; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.54 to 2.71). COVID-19 lockdown had a huge impact on smoking consumption of the Italian general population. The main concern is for smokers who increase their cigarette consumption due to an increased mental distress. Providing greater resources for cessation services capable of reducing mental health symptoms in smokers is urgently needed.","Carreras, Lugo, Stival, Amerio, Odone, Pacifici, Gallus, Gorini","https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056440","20210330","COVID-19; prevention; surveillance and monitoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12504,""
"Sexual health (excluding reproductive health, intimate partner violence and gender-based violence) and COVID-19: a scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing socioeconomic and health disparities, including disparities in sexual health and well-being. While there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and population health disparities generally-including some with attention to HIV-none has focused on sexual health (ie, STI care, female sexual health, sexual behaviour). We have conducted a scoping review focused on sexual health (excluding reproductive health (RH), intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender-based violence (GBV)) in the COVID-19 era, examining sexual behaviours and sexual health outcomes. A scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focused on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and COVID-19 was conducted on 15 September 2020. Multiple bibliographical databases were searched. Study selection conformed to Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. We only included English-language original studies. We found that men who have sex with men may be moving back toward pre-pandemic levels of sexual activity, and that STI and HIV testing rates seem to have decreased. There was minimal focus on outcomes such as the economic impact on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and STI care, especially STI care of marginalised populations. In terms of population groups, there was limited focus on sex workers or on women, especially women's sexual behaviour and mental health. We noticed limited use of qualitative techniques. Very few studies were in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). Sexual health research is critical during a global infectious disease pandemic and our review of studies suggested notable research gaps. Researchers can focus efforts on LMICs and under-researched topics within sexual health and explore the use of qualitative techniques and interventions where appropriate.","Kumar, Janmohamed, Nyhan, Forastiere, Zhang, KÃƒÂ¥gesten, Uhlich, Sarpong Frimpong, Van de Velde, Francis, Erausquin, Larrson, Callander, Scott, Minichiello, Tucker","https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2020-054896","20210330","COVID-19; HIV; sex work; sexual and gender minorities; sexual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12505,""
"Cutting Edge: Reduced Adenosine-to-Inosine Editing of Endogenous Alu RNAs in Severe COVID-19 Disease","Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with elevated inflammatory responses. One form of Aicardi-GoutiÃƒÂ¨res syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in <i>ADAR</i> results in reduced adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of endogenous dsRNAs, induction of IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes, other inflammatory mediators, morbidity, and mortality. Alu elements, Ã¢Ë†Â¼10% of the human genome, are the most common A-to-I-editing sites. Using leukocyte whole-genome RNA-sequencing data, we found reduced A-to-I editing of Alu dsRNAs in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Dendritic cells infected with COVID-19 also exhibit reduced A-to-I editing of Alu dsRNAs. Unedited Alu dsRNAs, but not edited Alu dsRNAs, are potent inducers of IRF and NF-ÃŽÂºB transcriptional responses, <i>IL6</i>, <i>IL8</i>, and IFN-stimulated genes. Thus, decreased A-to-I editing that may lead to accumulation of unedited Alu dsRNAs and increased inflammatory responses is associated with severe COVID-19 disease.","Crooke, Tossberg, Porter, Aune","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001428","20210330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12506,""

Fewer individuals sought emergency care for suicide-related behaviour during the earlier phase of the COVID-19 pandemic than expected when compared to prior years.

"[Telemedicine satisfaction of primary care patients during COVID-19 pandemics]","To assess telemedicine satisfaction of patients from a primary health care center during COVID-19 pandemics. This work could bring information on its acceptance. Transversal study with 253 individuals. A questionnaire was performed using Likert scale (1-very unsatisfied, 5-very satisfied) on patients with diabetes, hypertension and in subjects with other pathologies, whose consultations occurred between 01/04/2020 and 01/05/2020. Collected data included sociodemographics, previous telemedicine appointments, satisfaction levels of teleconsultation and doubt clarification, and interest in further telemedicine follow-up. In addition, a comparative analysis was performed between the periods January-February and April-May of 2020 in relation to age, sex, hypertension, diabetes and the type of contact (presential or remote). Statistics were performed using SPSSÃ‚Â® and ExcelÃ‚Â®. Diabetes follow-up appointments accounted for 34.4% of total consultations. Globally there was a high level of satisfaction and interest in future telemedicine follow-up. However, diabetic and older patients were less interested in this type of follow-up. Statistically significant differences about satisfaction were found in age, sex and presence/absence of diabetes. 70.6% of healthy patients preferred contact by e-mail over telephone. A selection bias is present because no randomization was made. The higher prevalence of diabetes consultations and the lack of adjustment for confounding factors can also affect results. Number of consults between January-February and April-May was compared and the main result was the significant reduction in the number of face-to-face consultations for diabetes (-50.1%) and hypertension (-94.1%). Presential consultations decreased by 72.6% and non-presential consultations increased by 61.9%. There was a selection bias because the sample was not random. The higher prevalence of diabetes consults and the lack of adjustment for confounders could affect results.

"Changes in Young Adults' Alcohol and Marijuana Use, Norms, and Motives From Before to During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Alongside the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with several secondary health effects. There is concern for increased substance use motivated by coping with stress, anxiety, depression, and boredom-all of which may be elevated during the pandemic. The current study examined intraindividual changes (from pre-COVID to during COVID) in young adults' alcohol and marijuana use, perceptions of peers' use (i.e., norms), and motives for use. A community sample of young adults (NÃ‚Â = 572; M<sub>age</sub>= 25.14; 60.8% women) was recruited in Washington State. By using a repeated-measures design, data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020) and again during the initial acute phase of the pandemic (April/May of 2020). Young adults, on average, increased alcohol use frequency but decreased the amount consumed per drinking occasion. No changes in marijuana use were identified. Young adults (on average) perceived that peers had increased the frequency and total amount of alcohol use and perceived that peers were engaging in heavier marijuana use than prior to COVID-19. For alcohol use motives, there was a significant increase in depression coping motives and significant decreases in social, enhancement, and conformity motives. Boredom motives for marijuana use significantly increased, while celebration motives decreased. Using a prospective design with a sample initially recruited in Washington State, these data indicate that (a) young adults' patterns of alcohol use may have changed, (b) young adults tend to think that peers are engaging in heavier alcohol/marijuana use than before the pandemic, and (c) motives for using alcohol/marijuana may have changed during the pandemic.","Graupensperger, Fleming, Jaffe, Rhew, Patrick, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.008","20210330","Cannabis; Drinking; SARS-CoV-2; Social distancing; Social norms; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12510,""
"Typhoon eye effect versus ripple effect: the role of family size on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted adversely upon the mental health of millions of people worldwide. Impacts on the mental health conditions and the associated predictors relating to adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remain understudied. Our aim was to investigate distress, anxiety, and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine mental health issues based on the distance from the epicenter, (a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries) based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The sample consisted of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distances from the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi. The results showed that 9.2 and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off criteria for distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance from the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance from the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan. The evidence of the study interestingly finds that the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance from the epicenter depends on family size. The evidence of this study can help to provide initial indicators for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lateef, Chen, Tahir, Lateef, Chen, Li, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00685-5","20210330","COVID-19; Family size; Mental health; Pakistan; Ripple effect; Typhoon eye effect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12511,""
"Mental burden and its risk and protective factors during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: systematic review and meta-analyses","Mental burden due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been widely reported for the general public and specific risk groups like healthcare workers and different patient populations. We aimed to assess its impact on mental health during the early phase by comparing pandemic with prepandemic data and to identify potential risk and protective factors. For this systematic review and meta-analyses, we systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020, and screened reference lists of included studies. In addition, we searched PubMed and PsycINFO for prepandemic comparative data. Survey studies assessing mental burden by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the general population, healthcare workers, or any patients (eg, COVID-19 patients), with a broad range of eligible mental health outcomes, and matching studies evaluating prepandemic comparative data in the same population (if available) were included. We used multilevel meta-analyses for main, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses, focusing on (perceived) stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep-related symptoms as primary outcomes. Of 2429 records retrieved, 104 were included in the review (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°208,261 participants), 43 in the meta-analysis (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°71,613 participants). While symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.40; 95% CI 0.15-0.65) and depression (SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.07-1.27) were increased in the general population during the early phase of the pandemic compared with prepandemic conditions, mental burden was not increased in patients as well as healthcare workers, irrespective of COVID-19 patient contact. Specific outcome measures (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire) and older comparative data (published Ã¢â€°Â¥5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years ago) were associated with increased mental burden. Across the three population groups, existing mental disorders, female sex, and concerns about getting infected were repeatedly reported as risk factors, while older age, a good economic situation, and education were protective. This meta-analysis paints a more differentiated picture of the mental health consequences in pandemic situations than previous reviews. High-quality, representative surveys, high granular longitudinal studies, and more research on protective factors are required to better understand the psychological impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to help design effective preventive measures and interventions that are tailored to the needs of specific population groups.","Kunzler, RÃƒÂ¶thke, GÃƒÂ¼nthner, Stoffers-Winterling, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Coenen, Rehfuess, Schwarzer, Binder, Schmucker, Meerpohl, Lieb","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00670-y","20210330","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Early phase; Health personnel; Meta-analysis; Pandemic; Psychological distress; SARS-CoV-2; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12512,""
"The association between food insecurity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","To explore the association between food insecurity and mental health outcomes among low-income Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a survey of 2714 low-income respondents nationwide from June 29, 2020 to July 21, 2020. A proportional odds logit model was employed to estimate the associations between food insecurity and anxiety and between food insecurity and depression. Food insecurity is associated with a 257% higher risk of anxiety and a 253% higher risk of depression. Losing a job during the pandemic is associated with a 32% increase in risk for anxiety and a 27% increase in risk for depression. Food insecurity caused by the pandemic was associated with increased risk of mental illness. The relative risk of mental illness from being food insecure is almost three-fold that of losing a job during the pandemic. Public health measures should focus on getting direct subsidies of food purchases to poor families, especially families with children. They should also reduce the stigma and shame that is associated with accepting charitable foods.","Fang, Thomsen, Nayga","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10631-0","20210330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12513,""

"Psychosocial health of school-aged children during the initial COVID-19 safer-at-home school mandates in Florida: a cross-sectional study","Given the emerging literature regarding the impacts of lockdown measures on mental health, this study aims to describe the psychosocial health of school-aged children and adolescents during the COVID-19 Safer-at-Home School mandates. A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°280) among K-12 students at a research school in North Central Florida. Bivariate analysis and logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine socio-demographic and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) predictors of indicators of anxiety-related, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD)-related symptoms. Outcomes (anxiety, OCD, and depressive related symptoms) were measured by indices generated based on reported symptoms associated with each psychosocial outcome. Loss of household income was associated with increased risk for all three index-based outcomes: depressive symptoms [aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.130, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(1.41-6.97)], anxiety-related symptoms [aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.531, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(1.154-5.551)], and OCD-related symptoms [aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.90, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(1.32-6.36)]. Being female was associated with being at higher risk for depressive symptoms [aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.72, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(1.02-2.93)], anxiety-related symptoms [aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.75, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(1.04-2.97)], and OCD-related symptoms [aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.764, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(1.027-3.028)]. Parental practices protective against COVID-19 were associated with children being at higher risk of depressive symptoms [aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.55, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(1.04-2.31)]. Lower school level was associated with children being at higher risk of anxiety-related and OCD-related symptoms. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, schools should prioritize mental health interventions that target younger, female students, and children of families with income loss. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 through school closure may exacerbate negative psychosocial health outcomes in children, thus school administrators should move quickly to target those at greatest risk.","McKune, Acosta, Diaz, Brittain, Beaulieu, Maurelli, Nelson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10540-2","20210330","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychosocial impacts; Vulnerable population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12515,""
"Exploring the public's perception of gambling addiction on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic: Topic modelling and sentiment analysis","The present study explored the topics and sentiment associated with gambling addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic, using topic modeling and sentiment analysis on tweets in English posted between 17-24<sup>th</sup> April 2020. The study was exploratory in nature, with its main objective consisting of inductively identifying topics embedded in user-generated content. We found that a five-topic model was the best in representing the data corpus, including: (i) the public's perception of gambling addiction amid the COVID-19 outbreak, (ii) risks and support available for those who stay at home, (iii) the users' interpretation of gambling addiction, (iv) forms of gambling during the pandemic, and (v) gambling advertising and impact on families. Sentiment analysis showed a prevalence of underlying fear, trust, sadness, and anger, across the corpus. Users viewed the pandemic as a driver of problematic gambling behaviors, possibly exposing unprepared individuals and communities to forms of online gambling, with potential long-term consequences and a significant impact on health systems. Despite the limitations of the study, we hypothesize that enhancing the presence of mental health operators and practitioners treating problem gambling on social media might positively impact public mental health and help prevent health services from being overwhelmed, in times when healthcare resources are limited.","Fino, Hanna-Khalil, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2021.1897064","20210330","Gambling; Twitter; addiction; sentiment analysis; topic modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12516,""
"Large gatherings? No, thank you Devaluation of crowded social scenes during the COVID-19 pandemic","In most European countries, the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (spring 2020) led to the imposition of physical distancing rules, resulting in a drastic and sudden reduction of real-life social interactions. Even people not directly affected by the virus itself were impacted in their physical and/or mental health, as well as in their financial security, by governmental lockdown measures. We investigated if the combination of these events had changed peopleâ€™s appraisal of social scenes by testing 241 participants recruited mainly in Italy, Austria, and Germany in an online, pre-registered study conducted about 50 days after the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. Images depicting individuals alone, in small groups (up to four people) and in large groups (more than seven people) were rated in terms of valence, arousal, and perceived physical distance. Pre-pandemic normative ratings were obtained from a validated database (Kurdi et al., 2017). Several self-report measures were also taken, and condensed into four factors through factor analysis. All images were rated as more arousing compared to the pre-pandemic period, and the greater the decrease in real-life physical interactions reported by participants, the higher the ratings of arousal. As expected, only images depicting large gatherings of people were rated less positively during, compared to before, the pandemic. These ratings of valence were however moderated by a factor that included participantsâ€™ number of days in isolation, relationship closeness, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Higher scores on this factor were associated with more positive ratings of images of individuals alone and in small groups, suggesting an increased appreciation of safer social situations, such as intimate and small-group contacts. The same factor was inversely related to the perceived physical distance between individuals in images of small and large groups, suggesting an impact of lockdown measures and contagion-related worries on the representation of interpersonal space. These findings point to rapid and compelling psychological and social consequences of the lockdown measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of social groups. Further studies should assess the long-term impact of such events as typical everyday life is restored.","Claudia Massaccesi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A6-BAF-8C3","20210331","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social gatherings; covid-19; valence; social distancing; perceived physical distance; arousal","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","",12517,""
