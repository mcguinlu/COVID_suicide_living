"Development and implementation of virtual clinical skills experiences for psychiatric nurse practitioner students","The educational preparation of nurse practitioner (NP) students includes didactic content and clinical experiences. These clinical experiences can be via clinical rotations or simulation. Although there is no specific list of clinical skills to prepare NP students for professional practice, the National Organization for Nurse Practitioner Faculties identifies core competencies for the basic education of NP students. These core competencies can be fulfilled through simulated clinical experiences. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions had to develop alternate methods of facilitating simulated clinical experiences for their NP students. Because of national, state, and university guidelines to transition all face-to-face educational activities to a virtual format, a Southeastern university simulation program developed and implemented virtual clinical skills experiences for psychiatric mental health NP students. Based on student survey results, the utilization of standardized patients in this virtual clinical skills experience proved beneficial and improved NP students' interviewing and communication skills via a telehealth format.","Davis, Moore, Farmer, Lewis","https://doi.org/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000669","20211022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19118,""
"Pandemic information dissemination and associations to symptoms of mental distress during COVID-19: A cross-sectional study","The 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic has added to the mental health strain on individuals and groups across the world in a variety of ways. Viral mitigation protocols and viral spread affect people on all continents every day, but to widely different degrees. To understand more about the mental health consequences of the pandemic it is important to investigate whether or how people gather pandemic-related information and how obtaining this information differentially affects individuals. This study seeks to investigate whether and to what extent higher levels of COVID-19-related media consumption across information sources are associated with symptoms of anxiety, health anxiety and depression, and whether and to what extent using social media and online interactive platforms versus traditional media platforms are associated with symptoms of anxiety, health anxiety and depression. Additionally, we seek to investigate whether and to what extent avoidance of COVID-19-related information are associated with aforementioned symptoms. In a cross-sectional, pre-registered survey, 4936 participants responded between June 22nd and July 13th, 2020. The eligible participants were adults currently residing in Norway and were thus subjected to identical viral mitigation protocols. This sample is a representative of the Norwegian population after utilizing an iterative raking algorithm to conduct post-stratification. As two subgroups (transgendered and intersex individuals) were too small to be analyzed, the final sample for descriptive statistics and regressions was 4921 participants. Multiple regressions were used to investigate associations between symptoms of psychopathology and COVID-19-related information dissemination. Part correlations were calculated as a measure of effect size for each predictor variable. Due to the large, anticipated sample size the pre-registered criteria for significance were set at P &lt; .01. Symptoms of anxiety and health anxiety was significantly associated with information obtainment using newspapers (P &lt; .001), social media (P &lt; .001) and the broader categories of online interactive (P &lt; .001) and traditional media (P &lt; .001). Symptoms of depression was significantly associated with information obtainment using newspapers (P &lt; .01), social media (P &lt; .01) and the broader category of online interactive media (P &lt; .001). Additionally, avoidance of COVID-19-related information emerged as a significant association in all three domains of psychopathological symptoms (anxiety and depression P &lt; .001, health anxiety P &lt; .01). The present study found significant associations between symptoms of psychopathology and media for informational attainment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant findings for informational attainment through newspapers, social media and online interactive media was seen across all three measures of psychopathology. Avoidance of COVID-19-related information and associations with symptoms of psychopathology emerged as a core finding, with generally higher effect sizes compared to informational attainment.

"Involvement, worries and loneliness of family caregivers of people with dementia during the COVID-19 visitor ban in long-term care facilities","To prevent COVID-19 from spreading in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), the Dutch government took restrictive measures, including a visitor-ban in LTCFs. This study examined the relationship between involvement of family caregivers (FCs) of people with dementia (PwD) living in LTCFs and FCs mental health during the visitor-ban, and whether this relationship was moderated by the frequency of alternative contact with PwD during the visitor-ban and FC resilience. This cross-sectional study collected data from 958 FCs. FCs who visited PwD more frequently before, were more worried during the visitor-ban than those with lower visiting frequency. FCs who visited the PwD daily before, but had minimal weekly contact during the visitor-ban, worried less. Resilient FCs who did social and task-related activities before, experienced less loneliness during the visitor-ban. It is advisable for healthcare professionals to reach out to these groups, to facilitate ongoing contact and help them overcome their loneliness.","Prins, Willemse, van der Velden, Pot, van der Roest","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2021.10.002","20211022","COVID-19; Caregiving; Dementia; Involvement; Loneliness; Nursing homes; The Netherlands; Worrying","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19120,""
"Mental health assessment of Spanish healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic A cross-sectional study","The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is posing unprecedented care scenarios, increasing the psychological distress among healthcare workers while reducing the efficiency of health systems. This work evaluated the psychological impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Spanish frontline healthcare workers of two tertiary hospitals. Healthcare workers were recruited from the medical units designated for the care of Covid-19 patients. The psychological assessment consisted of an individual, face-to-face session where gold-standard psychometric tests were administered to assess stress (VASS &amp; PSS-10), anxiety (STAI), depression (PHQ-2) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PCL-5). Regression models were also fitted to identify predictors of psychological distress. Overall, almost 13% of healthcare workers showed severe anxiety, while more than 26% had high levels of perceived stress. More than 23% presented severe posttraumatic stress symptoms, and another 13% had PHQ-2 scores equal to or above 3, compatible with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosis, respectively. Women, stress-related medication, overworking, performing in Covid-19 wards, and substance abuse were risk factors for increased psychological distress. Instead, practising exercise reduced the burden. This study outlines the severe psychological impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Spanish frontline healthcare workers. The stress, depression and anxiety levels found were similar to those reported in similar works but much higher than in Wuhan healthcare workers. Knowledge of risk factors for increased psychological distress may help to develop comprehensive intervention strategies to prevent, control and reduce the mental health exacerbation of healthcare workers, thereby maintaining the effectiveness of health systems in critical scenarios.","Sobregrau SangrÃƒÂ , AguilÃƒÂ³ Mir, Castro Ribeiro, Esteban-SepÃƒÂºlveda, GarcÃƒÂ­a PagÃƒÂ¨s, LÃƒÂ³pez Barbeito, Pomar Moya-Prats, Pintor PÃƒÂ©rez, AguilÃƒÂ³ Llobet","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152278","20211022","Acute stress symptoms; Anxiety symptoms; Depression symptoms; Healthcare workers; Posttraumatic stress disorder; SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19121,""
"Longitudinal effects of COVID-19-related loneliness on symptoms of mental distress among older adults in Austria","COVID-19-related social restrictions resulted in more loneliness, but whether this had further effects on mental health remains unclear. This study aimed at examining the longitudinal effects of COVID-19-related loneliness on mental health among older adults (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years) in Austria. Survey data were gathered from a longitudinal observational study among a random sample of older Austrian adults. The first survey wave was conducted in May 2020 (N<sub>1</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 557), and the second wave was conducted in March 2021 (N<sub>2</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 463). Data collection was based on either computer-assisted web or telephone interviewing. For statistical analysis, we used a cross-lagged panel analysis. The results showed the perceived COVID-19-related social restrictions to predict loneliness, which in turn predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms 10 months later. COVID-19-related loneliness emerged as a risk factor for subsequent mental distress among older adults in Austria.","Mayerl, Stolz, Freidl","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.09.009","20211022","Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19122,""
"Addressing the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multidisciplinary model of care","As of July 31, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had infected almost 200 million people worldwide. The growing burden of survivorship is substantial in terms of the complexity of long-term health effects and the number of people affected. Persistent symptoms have been reported in patients with both mild and severe acute COVID-19, including those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Early reports on the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) indicate that fatigue, dyspnoea, cough, headache, loss of taste or smell, and cognitive or mental health impairments are among the most common symptoms. These complex, multifactorial impairments across the domains of physical, cognitive, and mental health require a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to management. Decades of research on the multifaceted needs of and models of care for patients with post-intensive care syndrome provide a framework for the development of PASC clinics to address the immediate needs of both hospitalised and non-hospitalised survivors of COVID-19. Such clinics could also provide a platform for rigorous research into the natural history of PASC and the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions.","Parker, Brigham, Connolly, McPeake, Agranovich, Kenes, Casey, Reynolds, Schmidt, Kim, Kaplin, Sevin, Brodsky, Turnbull","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(21)00385-4","20211022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19123,""
"Development and Psychometric Properties of a Spiritual Needs Assessment Scale for Patients With COVID-19","The current mixed methods, exploratory study aimed to develop and determine the psychometrics of a scale to assess the spiritual needs of patients with corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study was performed in two stages: qualitative and quantitative. Through 14 interviews with patients with COVID-19, three themes, including <i>Composure</i>, <i>Meaning in Life</i>, and <i>Global Responsibility</i>, were formed. In the quantitative stage, content validity was achieved through the comments of 10 experts and patients. A total of 330 participants completed the instrument to assess construct validity. Exploratory factor analysis with 29 items and four subscales was performed, indicating a 6-point Likert scale. Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.82 for the whole scale and 0.85, 0.81, 0.79, and 0.72 for the Composure, Communication, Meaning in Life, and Global Responsibility subscales, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient (test-retest analysis) was 0.79 and showed acceptable stability for the scale. The ""Spiritual Needs Assessment Scale for COVID-19 Patients"" is a 29-item multi-dimensional scale with robust psychometric properties, which can measure various aspects regarding the spiritual needs of patients with COVID-19.

"Disrupted daily routines mediate the socioeconomic gradient of depression amid public health crises: A repeated cross-sectional study","There is a socioeconomic gradient to depression risks, with more pronounced inequality amid macroenvironmental potential traumatic events. Between mid-2019 and mid-2020, the Hong Kong population experienced drastic societal changes, including the escalating civil unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the change of the socioeconomic gradient in depression and the potential intermediary role of daily routine disruptions. We conducted repeated territory-wide telephone surveys in July 2019 and July 2020 with 1112 and 2034 population-representative Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong citizens above 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, respectively. Stratified by year, we examined the association between socioeconomic indicators (education attainment, household income, employment status and marital status) and probable depression (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Â©Â¾Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) using logistic regression. Differences in the socioeconomic gradient between 2019 and 2020 were tested. Finally, we performed a path analysis to test for the mediating role of daily routine disruptions. Logistic regression showed that higher education attainment in 2019 and being married in 2020 were protective against probable depression. Interaction analysis showed that the inverse association of higher education attainment with probable depression attenuated in 2020 but that of being married increased. Path analysis showed that the mediated effects through daily routine disruptions accounted for 95.9% of the socioeconomic gradient of probable depression in 2020, compared with 13.1% in 2019. From July 2019 to July 2020, the mediating role of daily routine disruptions in the socioeconomic gradient of depression in Hong Kong increased. It is thus implied that infection control measures should consider the relevant potential mental health impacts accordingly.","Lai, Chan, Li, Li, Hobfoll, Lee, Hou","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211051271","20211022","Health equity; major depressive disorder; public mental health; social epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19125,""

"Mental health among UK university staff and postgraduate students in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","To characterise the baseline King's College London Coronavirus Health and Experiences of Colleagues at King's cohort and describe patterns of probable depression and anxiety among staff and postgraduate research students at a large UK university in April/May 2020. An online survey was sent to current staff and postgraduate research students via email in April 2020 (n=2590). Primary outcomes were probable depression and anxiety, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. Secondary outcomes were alcohol use and perceived change in mental health. Outcomes were described using summary statistics and multivariable Poisson regression was used to explore associations with six groups of predictors: demographics and prior mental health, living arrangements, caring roles, healthcare, occupational factors and COVID-19 infection. All analyses were weighted to account for differences between the sample and target population in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity. Around 20% of staff members and 30% of postgraduate research students met thresholds for probable depression or anxiety on the questionnaires. This doubled to around 40% among younger respondents aged &lt;25. Other factors associated with probable depression and anxiety included female gender, belonging to an ethnic minority group, caregiving responsibilities and shielding or isolating. Around 20% of participants were found to reach cut-off for hazardous drinking on Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, while 30% were drinking more than before the pandemic.

We found a slight decrease in overall suicide rates after the outbreak (annual average rates were 16.4 and 15.5 per 100,000 population, respectively, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05). Age-stratified analysis indicated that suicide rates increased in younger (&lt;25) and decreased in the middle age group (25-64 years). In older age groups (Ã¢â€°Â¥65), an immediate rate decrease was observed followed by a sustained upward trend during the onset of the pandemic. Although an overall decrease in annual suicide rates was found after the outbreak, the age-specific subgroup analysis reveals a more nuanced picture.

During 2020, CLP referral patients more often had metabolic/endocrine disorders, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular diseases and less often had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma and autoimmune disorders compared to 2019. Also, the number of referrals made to CLP services in 2020 for treatment of new disorders declined significantly (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), whereas referrals for abnormal behavior/uncooperativeness (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), self-harm attempts (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007), and other reasons (evaluation for organ transplant, sleep disturbances; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.029) increased significantly. Further, significantly higher percentages of patients were diagnosed with delirium (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03) and depressive disorders (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04) in 2020 compared to 2019. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> There was a significant increase in the number of psychiatric referrals for depressive disorders and self-harm attempts among admitted patients from medical-surgical units during the COVID period. These findings suggest that there is a need to modify CLP services to address the needs of patients referred to CLP services, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Grover, Sahoo, Chakrabarti","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.21m02973","20211021","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19133,""

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Eating Disorders: What Can We Learn About Psychopathology and Treatment? A Systematic Review","This systematic review aims to collect evidence regarding the impact of the SarsCov-2 pandemic on people affected by eating disorders (EDs) targeting the following variables: psychopathology changes, mechanisms of vulnerability or resilience, and perception of treatment modifications during the pandemic. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a mental health deterioration has been detected in the general population and especially in people affected by pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, mental healthcare has moved toward online treatment. ED people showed a trend toward worsening of ED-specific psychopathology and impairment in general psychopathology. The most common vulnerability mechanisms were social isolation and feelings of uncertainty, while heightened self-care and reduced social pressure were resilience factors. The online treatment, although raising many concerns related to its quality, was considered the best alternative to the face-to-face approach. These findings may support the idea that stressful events contribute to the exacerbation of ED psychopathology and highlight the relevance of internalizing symptoms in EDs. The identification of putative risk and resilience variables as well as of subjective factors affecting online treatment perception may inform healthcare professionals and may promote more personalized approaches.","Monteleone, Cascino, Barone, Carfagno, Monteleone","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01294-0","20211021","COVID-19; Eating disorders; Psychopathology; Risk; Systematic review; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19135,""
"Loneliness, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese adults during COVID-19: A cross-sectional online survey","This study aims to investigate the potential factors associated with mental health outcomes among Chinese adults during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. This is an online cross-sectional survey conducted among Chinese adults in February 2020. Outcome measurements included the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3), two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-2), and two items from the Clinician-Administered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale. COVID-19 related factors, physical health, lifestyle, and self-efficacy were also measured. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed. This study included 1456 participants (age: 33.8Ã‚Â±10.5 years; female: 59.1%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness, and PTSD symptoms were 11.3%, 7.6%, 38.7%, and 33.9%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, loneliness was associated with being single, separated/divorced/widowed, low level of education, current location, medication, more somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, and going out frequently. Depression was associated with fear of infection, binge drinking, more somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, and longer screen time. Anxiety was associated with more somatic symptoms and lower self-efficacy. PTSD symptoms were associated with more somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, higher perceived risk of infection, fear of infection, and self-rated more negative influence due to the epidemic (p&lt;0.05). Mental health problems during the COVID-19 epidemic were associated with various biopsychosocial and COVID-19 related factors. Psychological interventions should be aware of these influencing factors and prioritize support for those people at higher risk.","Xu, Zhang, Xu, Li, Xie, Sun, Lee, Yip, Xiao, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259012","20211021","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19136,""
"[Epidemiological factors associated with safety incidents due to patient behavior reported in the hospital setting]","Incident reporting systems are an essential element in hospital safety programs. Our objective was to describe the magnitude, evolution and characteristics of adverse events due to patient behavior reported in a high complexity reference university hospital. Cross-sectional study. Period 2016-2019. From the hospital registry of adverse events, the notifications of the taxonomy ""Patient behavior"" were obtained. They were classified according to: type of behavior, category of the reporting professional, care area, sex of the patient/companion, risk and year. The Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â² test for the comparison of qualitative variables was used, and using a generalized linear model with Poisson distribution, prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated. Patient behavior reported incidents represented the 8.2%. There was an increasing trend with a slight decrease in the last year (2016 12.4%; 2017 29.5%; 2018 32.5% and 2019 25.6%). The areas of neurological and psychiatric diseases, and emergencies reported 36.9% and 19.7% of the cases, respectively. Nursing was the most reporting group (73.2%). More than 60% of notifications involved male patients. The PR doubled in escapes or attempts (2.2;95%CI=1.4-3.5), tripling in non-compliance with hospital rules (3.0;95%CI=1.9-4.7) and aggressive or intimidating behaviors (3.4:95% CI=2.2-5.3).

"HIV Infection and HIV-Associated Behaviors Among Persons Who Inject Drugs - 23 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, United States, 2018","In the United States, 10% of HIV infections diagnosed in 2018 were attributed to unsafe injection drug use or male-to-male sexual contact among persons who inject drugs (PWID) (1). In 2017, among PWID or men who have sex with men and who inject drugs (MSM-ID), 76% of those who received a diagnosis of HIV infection lived in urban areas* (2). To monitor the prevalence of HIV infection and associated behaviors among persons who reported injecting drugs in the past 12 months, including MSM-ID, CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) conducts interviews and HIV testing among populations of persons at high risk for HIV infection (MSM, PWID, and heterosexually active adults at increased risk for HIV infection) in selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) (3). The estimated HIV infection prevalence among PWID in 23 MSAs surveyed in 2018 was 7%. Among HIV-negative PWID, an estimated 26% receptively shared syringes and 68% had condomless vaginal sex during the preceding 12 months. During the same period, 57% had been tested for HIV infection, and 55% received syringes from a syringe services program (SSP). While overall SSP use did not significantly change since 2015, a substantial decrease in SSP use occurred among Black PWID, and HIV prevalence among Black PWID was higher than that among Hispanic and White PWID. These findings underscore the importance of continuing and expanding HIV prevention programs and community-based strategies for PWID, such as those provided by SSPs, especially following service disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic (4). Efforts are needed to ensure that PWID have low-barrier access to comprehensive and integrated needs-based SSPs (where legally permissible) that include provision of sterile syringes and safe syringe disposal, HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and referrals to HIV and HCV treatment, HIV preexposure prophylaxis, and treatment for substance use and mental health disorders.","Handanagic, Finlayson, Burnett, Broz, Wejnert, Abrego, Al-Tayyib, Anderson, Barak, Beckford, Bhattari, Brady, Brantley, Braunstein, Carrillo, Chambers, Clyde, De LeÃƒÂ³n, Deng, Doherty, Flynn, Flynn, Forrest, German, Glick, Griffin, Higgins, Ibrahim, Jaenicke, Jimenez, Khuwaja, Kienzle, Klevens, Lin, Lopez, Ma, Mathews, Marr, MartÃƒÂ­nez, McFarland, Melton, Menza, Miller, Moraga, Nixon, Nnumolu, O'Cleirigh, Opoku, Orellana, Padgett, Poe, Ramos, Reid, Rivera, Robinson, RolÃƒÂ³n-ColÃƒÂ³n, Sanger, Santacruz, Sey, Shinefeld, Shodell, Smith, Spencer, Tate, York, Todd, Wogayehu, Wortley, Vaaler","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7042a1","20211022","Adolescent; Adult; Drug Users; Female; HIV Infections; Health Risk Behaviors; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; United States; Urban Population; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19138,""
"Long term impact of Covid-19 infection on sleep and mental health: A cross-sectional study","The long-term impact of the COVID-19 infection on mental health in people and its relation to the severity is unclear.

"Crisis response among essential workers and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic","Limited research has been conducted on the mental health concerns of frontline and essential workers and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (U.S.). This study examined the association between working on the frontlines in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to July 2020) and personal crisis text concerns (e.g., self-harm, suicidal thoughts, anxiety/stress, and substance abuse) for frontline essential workers and the children of frontline workers. We used a novel data set from a crisis texting service, Crisis Text Line (CTL), that is widely used throughout the U.S.. Generalized Estimating Equations examined the individual association between eight specific crisis types (Depression, Stress/Anxiety, Self-Harm, Suicidal Thoughts, Substance Abuse, Isolation, Relationship Issues, and Abuse) and workers and their children during the early phase of the pandemic. Using CTL concerns as a proxy for the prevalence of mental health issues, we found that children of workers, specifically the youngest demographic (13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old and under), females, and non-conforming youth had a higher risk of crisis events during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Hispanic children of workers reported higher rates of stress/anxiety, whereas African American children of workers had higher rates of abuse and depression. Frontline workers had a higher risk of suicidal thoughts, and the risk of crisis events was generally highest for the 25 to 44 age group and males. Increases in CTL usage among frontline workers were noted 14-28Ã¢â‚¬Â¯days after spikes in local COVID-19 cases. The research to date has focused on the mental health of frontline essential workers, but our study highlights troubling trends in psychological stress among children of these workers.

"The importance of employment to workers with preexisting behavioral health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic","Little is known about the employment experiences of people with preexisting behavioral health conditions during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, despite the recognized importance of work for this group. Two hundred and seventy two adults with behavioral health conditions, recruited through statewide mental health networks in NJ and NY, completed an online survey in April-May 2020. Multivariable analysis examined the effects of sleep and dietary changes, COVID-19 exposure, anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) on employment status and job changes. Respondents' open-ended descriptions of pandemic-related changes in employment were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Two-thirds (65%) were employed, only 4% became unemployed, and 29% reported changes in their jobs as a result of the pandemic. In logistic regression analysis controlling for age, race, education and gender, workers were more likely than nonworkers to report altered eating and sleeping habits, but not greater anxiety or depression. However, those whose jobs changed were more likely to report COVID-19 exposure, altered sleep patterns, clinically significant anxiety symptoms, and both anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to those whose jobs had not changed. Qualitative analysis revealed work's positive impact (pride in job performance, using new skills, feeling safer working from home) and its negative effects (lifestyle disruption, worry about job security, isolation from coworkers). This is the first study to suggest the important role that work played for people with preexisting behavioral health disorders during the pandemic, with both positive and negative influences, and important implications for services and supports.

"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on dermatology residents: A nationwide French study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the practice of all health-care professionals. Determining the impact could prevent repercussions in future crisis. The objectives of the study were to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dermatology residents' professional practice, working conditions, academic training and mental health. An online questionnaire was sent to all French dermatology residents. We compared the activity of residents working in areas heavily impacted by COVID-19 to others. Logistic multivariate regressions were done, using as outcome variables the negative impact of the COVID crisis on residents' possibility to practice dermatology during the crisis, supervision, academic training and working more than 50 h/week. The last part of the questionnaire was the burnout questionnaire of Maslach. A total of 246 residents filled the questionnaire. Residents working in highly impacted COVID areas (odds ratio, OR 0.34 confidence interval, CI [0.18, 0.61], P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001), first-year postgraduate (PGY-1) residents (OR 0.46 CI [0.23, 0.91], P = 0.023) and those in private practice (OR 0.10 CI [0.01, 0.57], P = 0.032) were significantly less able to maintain dermatology activities. Worse supervision was significantly more frequent with non-PGY-1 residents (OR 3.24 CI [1.65, 6.65], P &lt; 0.001). One hundred and eighty one residents claimed the pandemic to have a negative effect on their dermatology curriculum with no difference according to their regions' affection by COVID-19. This was mostly attributed to the cancelation of courses and congresses. PGY-1 residents (OR 2.09 CI [1.09, 4.04], P = 0.029) and residents in highly affected areas (OR 1.79 CI [1.01, 3.18], P = 0.049) were more at risk of working above the maximal legal working time.

"Prevalence of Anxiety and Relationship of Anxiety with Coping Styles and Related Factors in Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim is to investigate anxiety prevalence among the healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic and the also relationship of ""significant clinical anxiety"" with coping styles and the related factors. An online questionnaire was performed to evaluate the anxiety responses of 544 healthcare workers, the adopted coping styles and the related factors during COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included the subsections of sociodemographic data, other clinical data and the items on exposure to social media, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) Scale and Coping Styles Scale Brief Form. Minimal, mild, moderate and severe anxiety were present in 214 (39.3%), 191 (35.1%), 95 (17.5%) and 44 (8.1%) participants, respectively. GAD-7 score was Ã¢â€°Â¥10 in 139 (25.6%) of the participants indicating ""significant clinical anxiety"". Being female and a nurse were associated with significant clinical anxiety. In addition, the parameters such as ""concern about COVID-19, concern about infect COVID-19 to relatives, unwillingness to work, frequency of social media use about COVID-19, sleep disturbances and experiencing somatic symptoms"" were observed to be extremely significantly more common in the healthcare workers with ""significant clinical anxiety"" than those without that mental condition. The regression analysis revealed that higher adoption of using emotional social support, one of the emotional focused coping styles and behavioral disengagement, one of the ineffektive focused coping styles are considered to be predictor of significant clinical anxiety. Whereas, positive reinterpretation, one of the emotional focused coping styles was a predictor in reduction of significant clinical anxiety. Also more frequent exposure to social media and sleep disturbances were the predictors of significant clinical anxiety in the healthcare staff.

In this emergency situation, variables such as depression, anxiety and external locus of control could be related to a Problematic Internet Use; on the other hand, self-esteem, internal locus of control, self-efficacy, and social support can play the role of protective factors for Problematic Internet Use. The present survey aims to verify the impact of these intrapersonal and social factors on Problematic Internet Use in college and High School students during the COVID-19 pandemic through a web-based cross-sectional study. 191 students from Lombardy, one of the Italian Regions among the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, were included in the study. An online questionnaire has been administered during the first Italian period of forced lockdown. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess intrapersonal and social factors as predictors of Problematic Internet Use. Analysis highlighted a higher risk of Problematic Internet Use (5.77 times more) in males compared to females. Individuals with high external locus of control and severe depression have respectively 6.56 and 2.84 times more the risk of presenting Problematic Internet Use. In contrast, social support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem were negatively related to Problematic Internet Use. In total sample, the percentage of Problematic Internet Use was high (55.5%). An increasing use of the Internet has been observed during lockdown, leading to a progressive increase in the diffusion of Problematic Internet Use. Gender, depression and external locus of control emerge as risk factors for Problematic Internet Use, while social support, self-efficacy and self-esteem represent protective factors. The current research identifies some intrapersonal and social factors in an epidemic context for which the development of effective behavioural, supportive and/or educational interventions would be appropriate.","Truzoli, Pirola, Celebre, Piccoli, Vanzetto, Conti, Fasciana, Casazza","https://www.google.com/search?q=Intrapersonal+and+Social+Factors+for+Problematic+Internet+Use+among+Students+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20211022","Behavior, Addictive; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internet Use; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Social Factors; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19146,""
"Proximity to COVID-19 on Mental Health Symptoms among Hospital Medical Staff","Exposure to patients with COVID-19 can have a significant impact on mental health of hospital medical staff. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of proximity to patients with COVID-19 considering occupational position and gender on the mental health of hospital staff. N=78 participants were included in the study, with n=40 of them with direct contact to patients with COVID-19 (51%); eight had contact with patients suspected of having COVID-19 (10%), and n=30 with no direct contact to people with COVID-19 (39%). Multinomial regression analyses showed that proximity had a negative (inverse) influence on avoidance behaviour as part of PTSD, physical symptoms, somatization, compulsiveness and anger expression-in as tendency to suppress anger. In addition, there was a significant impact of the female gender on increased physical symptoms, while age, work experience and occupation had no further influence. These results that hospital medical staff is less psychologically stressed when closer to COVID-19 patients are inconsistent with previous studies. Self-efficacy and locus of control in these situations are relevant for processing the trauma. In summary, perception of personal risk is essential. Proximity is believed to be a proxy variable for personal risk perception. As a synopsis of these results, regular briefings of the hospital staff are recommended to prevent psychological impairment. They should contain specific information about conditions in the affected wards and the risk of infection, which could help reduce risk perception of medical personnel.","Wesemann, Vogel, Willmund, Kupusovic, Pesch, Hadjamu, Holzner, Wakili, Rassaf, Siebermair","https://www.google.com/search?q=Proximity+to+COVID-19+on+Mental+Health+Symptoms+among+Hospital+Medical+Staff.","20211022","COVID-19; Female; Humans; Medical Staff, Hospital; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19147,""
"The Psychological Effects of COVID 19 on Medical and Non-medical University Students","The COVID 19 pandemic has had significant psychological effects on university students as well as in all segments of society. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between education fields (medical-non medical), education styles (online-face to face), sociodemographic characteristics of university students and their levels of depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID-19. In the cross-sectional designed research, 1213 university students studying in Turkey was reached online. A sociodemographic form, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was applied to the participants. Of all participants 887 (73%) were women. 647 (53%) students were studying in the medical field. The scores of FCV-19S and all subscales of DASS 21 were significantly higher in women. In the comparison between the field and style of education, no difference was found. DASS 21 scores were higher in the participants whose relatives had COVID-19 or who had a mental disorder in the past or medical disease. In this study, it was observed that while there was no significant difference in the scores of DASS 21 among university students in terms of the field and style of education, variables such as gender, not having COVID-19 so far, having lost a relative due to COVID-19 could cause significant differences.

"Psychological Effects of ""Double Crisis"" (COVID-19 Pandemic and Earthquakes) on Croatian Medical Students","In 2020. the COVID-19 pandemic presented an additional source of stress and anxiety not just to the general population but also to medical students who are, even under normal circumstances, constantly under pressure due to demanding student duties. In addition, they experienced a series of devastating earthquakes in and around the Zagreb region which altogether could have had compromised their psychological well-being. The aim of this review was to evaluate the psychological effects of these two natural disasters on the mental health of Croatian medical students. According to standardized questionnaires for depression and anxiety evaluation, 75.3% of students were anxious and 65.2% were depressive during the ""double crisis"". No significant difference of these two outcomes was observed regarding genders, but it was found that first year students had a significantly higher anxiety score than older ones. In such stressful situations, we should emphasize the importance of mental health not just of healthcare workers, but also of medical students in order to prevent serious psychological consequences and to alleviate the negative effects on students' motivation and their educational process.","Romic, Silovski, Mance, Pavlek, Petrovic, Figl, Grbavac, Moric, Romic, Bakula, Vulic","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Effects+of+Double+Crisis+(COVID-19+Pandemic+and+Earthquakes)+on+Croatian+Medical+Students.","20211022","COVID-19; Depression; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19149,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Medical Students at the University of Mostar","Previous studies have shown that medical students are more prone to depression, more tired, and more prone to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and burnout syndrome than other students. In terms of mental health, they are a ""more vulnerable"" than individuals of the same age in the general population. In December 2019 in Wuhan (China) the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus captured worldwide attention. The implementation of strict quarantine measures kept a large number of people in self-isolation which affected all aspects of life. Objective of the study is to determine the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life of medical students and the differences in the impact between genders and years of study. This is a cross-sectional study conducted from May 25 to June 5 2020. It includes medical students who resided in the country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed a modified anonymous online questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale, indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and lifestyle changes due to a pandemic. The mean IES score in the participants showed a moderate stressful impact, with the mean IES score of females being significantly higher than that of males (29 vs. 19) with p&lt;0.001. More than half of the participants had an IES score Ã¢â€°Â¥26. With the onset of the pandemic, 71.5% of all medical students reported feeling increased stress from commitments. the pandemic had stressful impact on the mental health of medical students and it was significantly more stressful for women and students in the preclinical years of study.

"Psychological health status among thyroid cancer patients during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","To investigate the psychological health status and explore the impact of different factors among thyroid cancer patients during the peak period of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. With thyroid cancer patients who had attended Peking Union Medical College Hospital included, we collected their demographic and clinical characteristics, COVID-19-related factors, and outcomes of 4 psychological scales (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]) through an online questionnaire and used multiple linear regression to find independent risk factors for each psychological symptom. A total of 219 patients were included. Insomnia, anxiety, depression, and clinically relevant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were reported by 69 (31.5%), 87 (39.7%), 74 (33.8%), and 44 (20.1%) patients, respectively. Based on multiple linear regression, being single/divorced/widowed, having a lower level of education, receiving resources of science lectures during the epidemic, and experiencing disruption of routine treatment or follow-up were associated with poorer psychological health among patients with thyroid cancer. High rates of psychological symptoms and potential risk factors were found in thyroid cancer patients during the peak period of COVID-19 in China.

"Family Function, Loneliness, Emotion Regulation, and Hope in Secondary Vocational School Students: A Moderated Mediation Model","This study explored family function as a key factor of loneliness, hope, and emotion related to secondary vocational school students during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Chinese versions of the Olson Family Function Scale, Russell Loneliness Scale, Snyder Hope Scale, and Gross Emotion Regulation Scale were completed by 5,138 participants. Guardian type significantly predicted family function and loneliness. Family function significantly and positively correlated with loneliness. The relationship between family function and loneliness was mediated by hope, and expressive suppression concurrently moderated the relationship between hope and loneliness. Our study offers meaningful insights into the family function of Chinese secondary vocational school students. The findings supported a moderated mediation model that exemplifies the relationship between family function, loneliness, expressive suppression, and hope. Although the results showed that high hope mediated lower family functioning and loneliness, low expressive suppression led to intense loneliness immediately. This study confirms that emotional strategy is important and associated with mental health. It also suggests that schools should pay more attention to students' emotion regulation and help them rebuild hope or appropriate cognition to relieve loneliness during crisis events.","Yun, Xiaohong, Zhongping, Zhujun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.722276","20211022","emotion regulation; expressive suppression; family function; hope; loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19155,""
"The Association Between Depressive Symptomology, Psychological Burden Related to COVID-19, and Engagement in Physical Exercise Among College Students","<b>Introduction:</b> The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in substantial changes to the normalcy of daily life. Research conducted in Western Europe point to elevated levels of depression, rumination and worry as well psychological burden. These in turn impact the capacity of individuals to adhere to lockdown measures and health-protective behaviours. Investigations of these pandemic-related mental health constructs in the Middle East appears sparse. Moreover, there is an immense need to investigate the potential for simple strategies that might be used by individuals whilst in lockdown to combat the onset of mental health difficulties. Regular physical exercise may prove valuable in this regard. <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the potential mediational role of engagement in physical exercise on the association between depression and psychological burden related to COVID-19. <b>Method:</b> A sample of 1,322 participants (m<sub>age</sub> = 19.50 years, SD = 1.54) completed measures of depression and psychological burden related to COVID-19 and self-reported their frequency of physical exercise. Data were collected between February and May 2021 in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. <b>Results:</b> Analyses revealed statistically significant associations between depression and psychological burden as well as between elevated depression and reduced physical exercise. Mediation analyses in which the potential mediational role of physical exercise was examined were not significant. <b>Conclusions:</b> Depression and psychological burden related to the pandemic appear to be prevalent in these Middle Eastern locations. Whilst physical exercise appears to be beneficial in combating depression, it does not appear to be a sufficient strategy for impeding the experience of psychological burden. Investigation of the contribution of additional strategies is required.","Vally, Helmy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.741964","20211022","COVID-19; burden; coronavirus; depression; exercise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19156,""
"COVID-19 pneumonia: pathophysiology and management","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is an evolving disease. We will focus on the development of its pathophysiologic characteristics over time, and how these time-related changes determine modifications in treatment. In the emergency department: the peculiar characteristic is the coexistence, in a significant fraction of patients, of severe hypoxaemia, near-normal lung computed tomography imaging, lung gas volume and respiratory mechanics. Despite high respiratory drive, dyspnoea and respiratory rate are often normal. The underlying mechanism is primarily altered lung perfusion. The anatomical prerequisites for PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to work (lung oedema, atelectasis, and therefore recruitability) are lacking. In the high-dependency unit: the disease starts to worsen either because of its natural evolution or additional patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). Oedema and atelectasis may develop, increasing recruitability. Noninvasive supports are indicated if they result in a reversal of hypoxaemia and a decreased inspiratory effort. Otherwise, mechanical ventilation should be considered to avert P-SILI. In the intensive care unit: the primary characteristic of the advance of unresolved COVID-19 disease is a progressive shift from oedema or atelectasis to less reversible structural lung alterations to lung fibrosis. These later characteristics are associated with notable impairment of respiratory mechanics, increased arterial carbon dioxide tension (<i>P</i> <sub>aCO<sub>2</sub></sub> ), decreased recruitability and lack of response to PEEP and prone positioning.","Gattinoni, Gattarello, Steinberg, Busana, Palermo, Lazzari, Romitti, Quintel, Meissner, Marini, Chiumello, Camporota","https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0138-2021","20211021","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19157,""
"Psychological burden of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder traits on medical workers under the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey","There are numerous reports on the psychological burden of medical workers after the COVID-19 outbreak; however, no study has examined the influence of developmental characteristics on the mental health of medical workers. The objective of this study was to examine whether the developmental characteristics of medical workers are associated with anxiety and depression after the COVID-19 outbreak. We conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey in October 2020. The data of 640 medical workers were analysed. The questionnaire included items on sociodemographic data, changes in their life after the COVID-19 outbreak and symptoms of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits and autism spectrum disorder traits. Depression symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and anxiety symptoms were assessed by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to test the effects of developmental characteristics on depression and anxiety symptoms after controlling for sociodemographic factors and changes in participants' lives after the COVID-19 outbreak. Increases in physical and psychological burden were observed in 49.1% and 78.3% of the subjects, respectively. The results of a multiple regression analysis showed that ADHD traits were significantly associated with both depression (ÃŽÂ²=0.390, p&lt;0.001) and anxiety (ÃŽÂ²=0.426, p&lt;0.001). Autistic traits were significantly associated with depression (ÃŽÂ²=0.069, p&lt;0.05) but not anxiety. Increased physical and psychological burden, being female, medical workers other than physicians and nurses, fear of COVID-19 and experience of discrimination were also significantly associated with both depression and anxiety. Globally, the burden on medical workers increased. This study suggested that medical workers with higher ADHD traits may need special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Matsui, Yoshiike, Tsuru, Otsuki, Nagao, Ayabe, Hazumi, Utsumi, Yamamoto, Fukumizu, Kuriyama","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053737","20211021","COVID-19; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19158,""

"Double jeopardy from the COVID-19 pandemic: risk of exposure and income loss in Portugal","Increasing evidence indicates that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had immediate health and social impact, disproportionately affecting certain socioeconomic groups. Assessing inequalities in risk of exposure and in adversities faced during the pandemic is critical to inform targeted actions that effectively prevent disproportionate spread and reduce social and health inequities. This study examines i) the socioeconomic and mental health characteristics of individuals working in the workplace, thus at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, and ii) individual income losses resulting from the pandemic across socioeconomic subgroups of a working population, during the first confinement in Portugal. This study uses data from 'COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion', a community-based online survey in Portugal. The sample for analysis comprised nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°129,078 workers. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of factors associated with working in the workplace during the confinement period and with having lost income due to the pandemic. Over a third of the participants reported working in the workplace during the first confinement. This was more likely among those with lower income [AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.93 (2.64-3.25)], lower education [AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.17 (3.04-3.30)] and working as employee [AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.09 (1.04-1.15)]. Working in the workplace was positively associated with frequent feelings of agitation, anxiety or sadness [AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.14 (1.09-1.20)] and perception of high risk of infection [AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.06 (10.53-11.61)]. About 43% of the respondents reported having lost income due to the pandemic. The economic consequences affected greatly the groups at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, namely those with lower education [AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.36 (1.19-1.56)] and lower income [AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.13 (2.47-3.96)]. The social gradient in risk of exposure and in economic impact of the pandemic can result in an accumulated vulnerability for socioeconomic deprived populations. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a double effect in these groups, contributing to heightened disparities and poor health outcomes, including in mental health. Protecting the most vulnerable populations is key to prevent the spread of the disease and mitigate the deepening of social and health disparities. Action is needed to develop policies and more extensive measures for reducing disproportionate experiences of adversity from the COVID-19 pandemic among most vulnerable populations.","Gama, Alves, Costa, Laires, Soares, Pedro, Moniz, Solinho, Nunes, Dias","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01569-1","20211021","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health; Socioeconomic disparities; Vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19161,""
"""Surviving to thriving"": a meta-ethnography of the experiences of healthcare staff caring for persons with COVID-19","The emergence of the Coronavirus disease has heightened the experience of emotional burden among healthcare staff. To guide the development of support programmes, this review sought to aggregate and synthesise qualitative studies to establish a comparative understanding of the experiences of healthcare staff caring for persons with the disease. A meta-ethnography approach was used to aggregate and synthesise primary qualitative studies. Database search was undertaken from January to November 2020. A standardised tool was used to extract data from the identified primary studies. The studies were translated into each other to formulate overarching concepts/ metaphors which formed the basis of undertaking a narrative synthesis. Eight qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Two overarching metaphors/ concepts were formulated from the primary studies: 1) surviving to thriving in an evolving space and 2) support amid the new normal. The initial phase of entering the space of caring during the outbreak was filled with psychological chaos as healthcare staff struggled to survive within the context of an illness which was not fully understood. Gradually, healthcare staff may transition to a thriving phase characterised by resilience but still experienced heavy workload and physical/ emotional exhaustion predisposing them to burnout and compassion fatigue. Fear persisted throughout their experiences: fear of contracting the disease or infecting one's family members/ loved ones remained a key concern among healthcare staff despite infection precaution measures. Healthcare staff who contracted the disease felt isolated with additional fears of dying alone. The sources of support were varied with a strong emphasis on peer support. Healthcare staff caring for persons infected with the Coronavirus disease are at risk of burnout and compassion fatigue and require ongoing mental health support commensurate to their needs. Staff who contract the disease may require additional support to navigate through the illness and recovery. Policies and concerted efforts are needed to strengthen support systems and build resilience among healthcare staff.","Agyei, Bayuo, Baffour, Laari","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07112-w","20211022","Experiences; Healthcare professionals; Meta-ethnography; Anthropology, Cultural; COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Health Facilities; Humans; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19162,""
"When in doubt, Google it: distress-related information seeking in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychological health has been one of the aspects affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to evaluate the patterns of Google search for mental distress symptoms of Italian citizens during the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed Google searches for psychological-health related words. We gathered and analyzed data on daily search queries on depression, anxiety, and insomnia from Google Trends, in a time ranging from the Pre-COVID phase (beginning 25th January 2020) up to the second wave phase (ending 17th October 2020). We performed three general linear models on search trends of the three words and tested whether and to what extent official data about new cases of COVID-19, information searching on new cases, and the government health measures impacted on these trends. Average daily search queries were higher for anxiety, followed by depression and insomnia. General linear models performed to assess differences in daily search queries for anxiety, depression and insomnia were significant, respectively [F(13, 253)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.80, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001]; [F(13, 253)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.25, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001]; [F(13, 253)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.61, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001]. Specifically, daily search queries differed among different phases of managing the COVID-19 outbreak: anxiety [F(5, 253)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.35, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, [Formula: see text] = .17]; depression [F(5, 253)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.59, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, [Formula: see text] = .21]; insomnia [F(5, 253)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.52, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004, [Formula: see text] = .07]. Our study contributed to the investigation of online information-seeking behaviors of Italians regarding mental health throughout the entire phase of the pandemic and provides insights on the possible future trends of mental distress during upcoming pandemic phases.","Monzani, Vergani, Marton, Pizzoli, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11887-2","20211021","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Google; Infodemiology; Insomnia; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19163,""
"The impact of relaxation of methadone take-home protocols on treatment outcomes in the COVID-19 era","Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) allowed for an increase in methadone take-home doses for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in March 2020. To evaluate the effects of the SAMSHA exemption on methadone adherence and OUD-related outcomes. A convenience sample of 183 clients (58% female) were recruited from a methadone clinic in the fall of 2019 for a cross-sectional survey. Survey data was linked to clinical records, including urine drug testing (UDT) results for methadone and emergency department (ED) visits at the local hospital. Participants were on stable methadone dosing for 9Ã‚Â months prior to and following March 2020. Methadone adherence was assessed by UDTs; OUD-related outcomes were assessed by overdose events and ED visits. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between change in take-home methadone doses and outcomes. Mean take-home doses increased nearly 200% (11.4 doses/30Ã‚Â days pre-COVID-19 vs. 22.3 post-SAMHSA exemption). ED visits dropped from 74 (40.4%) pre-COVID-19 to 56 (30.6%) post-SAMHSA exemption (<i>p</i> =Ã‚Â &lt;0.001). No significant changes were observed in either the number of clients experiencing overdose or those who experienced one or more methadone negative UDTs in the post-SAMHSA exemption period. Adjusted models did not show a significant association between changes in take-home doses and associated outcomes. Despite a near-doubling of take-home methadone doses during the COVID-19 exemption period, the increase in take-home doses was not associated with negative treatment outcomes in methadone-adherent clients.","Amram, Amiri, Panwala, Lutz, Joudrey, Socias","https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2021.1979991","20211021","COVID-19; addiction; methadone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19164,""
"Intolerance of uncertainty and distress in women with delayed IVF treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of situation appraisal and coping strategies","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays of numerous medical procedures, including IVF. This study investigates the relationship between Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), situation appraisal-the perceived threat that COVID-19 poses for infertility treatment, coping strategies, and general distress among women with a delayed IVF procedure. SEM showed that situation appraisal is a partial mediator of the relationship between IU and avoidance, as well as the relationship between IU and general distress. The connection between situation appraisal and general distress is partially mediated by avoidance. In this challenging context for mental health, situation appraisal and coping strategies determine the level of distress, where IU, as a dispositional variable, represents the main determinant of the entire reaction.","MitroviÃ„â€¡, KostiÃ„â€¡, RistiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591053211049950","20211021","COVID-19; coping strategies; infertility; intolerance of uncertainty; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19165,""

"Emotional eating behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Background & aims The study aimed to evaluate emotional eating tendency of Turkish individuals during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study comprised an online questionnaire and it was conducted from August to September 2020. The survey was distributed through social networks. Results A total of 1626 adults have been included in the study, aged between 18 and 65 years (69.6% females and 30.4% males). The average BMI of all participants was 24.4Â Â±Â 4.7Â kg/m2, 6% were underweight, and 11.6% were obese. A total of 32.7% of the participants had an increase in appetite and 34.4% had a weight gain. It was found that most of the participants (75.7%) were emotional eaters at different levels. Emotional eating was more common in obese people (43.5%) than normal weight (33.5%) and underweight (18.4%) people. It was examined the increasing food intake according to the BMI, the obese increased the consumption of fresh vegetables, fruits, pastries, and, eggs; underweight increased the consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits, milk and, eggs. As in other countries, a weight gain was observed in the individuals. However, the participants resorted to emotional eating to cope with negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress caused by the pandemic. Conclusions In this study, it has been provided preliminary data that can be used in future studies to determine the emotional eating behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.09.745","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","",19172,""
