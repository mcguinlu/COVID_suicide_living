"A novel poly (4-methyl-1-pentene)/polypropylene (PMP/PP) thin film composite (TFC) artificial lung membrane for enhanced gas transport and excellent hemo-compatibility","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a technique that provides short-term supports to the heart and lungs. It removes CO2 from the blood and provides enough oxygen, which is a huge help in the fight against COVID-19. As the key component, the artificial lung membranes have evolved in three generations including silicon, polypropylene and poly (4-methyl-1-pentene). Herein, we for the first time design and fabricate a novel poly (4-methyl-1-pentene)/polypropylene (PMP/PP) thin film composite (TFC) membrane with the anticoagulant coating composed of poly (sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) and cross-linked poly (vinyl alcohol). Poly (sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) provides sulfonic acid groups to inhibit the coagulant factors (FVIII and FXII), and cross-linked poly (vinyl alcohol) increase the stability of the anticoagulant coating and further improve the hydrophilicity via abundant hydroxyl groups to depress the protein adsorption. Long-term anticoagulant property was demonstrated by whole human blood for 28 days. Blood compatibility was evaluated by hemolysis rate, anticoagulation activity (APTT, TT and PT), complement activation, platelet activation and contact activation. Pure CO2, O2 and N2 permeation rates were determined to evaluate the mass transfer properties of PMP/PP TFC membranes. Gas permeation results revealed that gas permeation flux increased in the TFC membranes because of the decrease of crystallinity. Overall, the so prepared PMP/PP membrane shows good CO2/O2 selectivity and blood compatibility as novel TFC artificial lung membrane.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.120359","20220505","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-02","",27692,""
