"Long-term mental health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection: prospective cohort study","Background Despite previous evidence from retrospective cohorts suggest that survivors of COVID-19 may be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, questions remain on the incidence and absolute risk of psychiatric outcomes, and on the potential protective effect of vaccination. Addressing these knowledge gaps will help public health and clinical service planning during the ongoing pandemic. Methods Based on UK Biobank prospective data, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 infection cohort including participants with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021; a contemporary control cohort with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2, and a historical control cohort predating the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional control cohorts were constructed for benchmarking, including participants diagnosed with other respiratory tract infection, or with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. We used propensity score weighting using predefined (clinically informed) and data-driven covariates to minimize confounding. We then estimated incidence rates and risk of first psychiatric disorders diagnosed by ICD-10 codes and psychotropic prescriptions after SARS-CoV-2 infection using cause-specific Cox models. Results In this prospective cohort including 406,579 adults (224,681 women, 181,898 men; mean [SD] age 66.1 [8.4] years), 26,181 had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with contemporary controls (n=380,398), COVID-19 survivors had increased risks of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses (HR: 2.02, 95% CI 1.85-2.21; difference in incidence rate: 24.85, 95 CI 20.69-29.39 per 1000 person-years) and psychotropic prescriptions (HR: 1.61, 95% CI 1.48-1.75; difference in incidence rate: 21.77, 95% CI 16.59-27.54 per 1000 person-years). Regarding individual mental health related outcomes, the SARS-CoV-2 infection cohort showed an increased risk of psychotic disorders (2.26, 1.28-3.98), mood disorders (2.19, 1.92-2.50), anxiety disorders (2.08, 1.82-2.38), substance use disorders (1.59, 1.34-1.90), sleep disorders (1.95, 1.60-2.39); and prescriptions for antipsychotics (3.78, 2.74-5.21), antidepressants (1.55, 1.29-1.87), benzodiazepines (1.82, 1.58-2.11), and opioids (1.40, 1.26-1.55). Overall, the risk of any mental health outcome was increased with a HR of 1.58, 95% CI 1.47-1.70; and difference in incidence rate of 32.04, 25.76-38.81 per 1000 person-years. These results were consistent when comparing to a historical control cohort. Additionally, mental health risks were increased even further in participants who tested positive in hospital settings. Finally, participants who were fully vaccinated had a lower risk of mental health outcomes compared to those infected when unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. All observed risks of mental health outcomes were attenuated or even lower after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those with other respiratory infections, or with participants in the test-negative control cohort. Conclusions In this prospective cohort study, people who survived COVID-19 were at increased risk of psychiatric outcomes and related psychotropic medications. These risks were higher in those with more severe disease, treated in hospital settings, and were significantly reduced in fully vaccinated people. Of note, compared to participants with other respiratory infections or with only negative testing results, those infected with SARS-CoV-2 had an even lower risk of mental health outcomes, warranting further research into causation. The early identification and treatment of psychiatric disorders among survivors of COVID-19 should be a priority in the long-term management of COVID-19. Particular attention might be needed for those with severe (hospitalized) disease and those who were not fully vaccinated at the time of infection.","Yunhe Wang; Junqing Xie; GARCIA CLEMENTE; DANIEL PRIETO-ALHAMBRA","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.26.22280293","20220927","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-28","",38319,""
"Presentation of long COVID and associated risk factors in a mobile health study","Background The Covid Collab study was a citizen science mobile health research project set up in June 2020 to monitor COVID-19 symptoms and mental health through questionnaire self-reports and passive wearable device data. Methods Using mobile health data, we consider whether a participant is suffering from long COVID in two ways. Firstly, by whether the participant has a persistent change in a physiological signal commencing at a diagnosis of COVID-19 that last for at least twelve weeks. Secondly, by whether a participant has self-reported persistent symptoms for at least twelve weeks. We assess sociodemographic and wearable-based risk factors for the development of long COVID according to the above two categorisations. Findings Persistent changes to physiological signals measured by com- mercial fitness wearables, including heart rate, sleep, and activity, are visible following a COVID-19 infection and may help differentiate people who develop long COVID. Anxiety and depression are significantly and persistently affected at a group level following a COVID-19 infection. We found the level of activity undertaken in the year prior to illness was protective against long COVID and that symptoms of depression before and during the acute illness may be a risk factor. Interpretation Mobile health and wearable devices may prove to be a useful resource for tracking recovery and presence of long-term sequelae to COVID-19. Mental wellbeing is significantly negatively effected on average for an extended period of time following a COVID-19 infection.","Callum Stewart; Yatharth Ranjan; Pauline Conde; Shaoxiong Sun; Zulqarnain Rashid; Heet Sankesara; Nicholas Cummins; Petroula Laiou; Xi Bai; Richard Dobson; Amos Folarin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.27.22280404","20220927","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-28","",38320,""
"The relationship between loneliness and consumer shopping channel choice: Evidence from China","Loneliness has spread globally and the COVID-19 outbreak has boosted the number of lonely consumers. The retail industry and its consumptions channels have changed dramatically since the pandemic and helped consumers resist loneliness. Faced by multiple channel choices, how consumers' loneliness affects their channel preferences is a contemporary issue that needs to be addressed. By introducing protection motivation theory, logit model, and maximum likelihood estimation, we find that consumers' perceived vulnerability to loneliness and their self-efficacy towards online shopping are the main factors influencing channel preference. Additionally, their negative attitude towards online shopping mediates the effect of perceived vulnerability on channel preference. Simultaneously, the perceived vulnerability and severity caused by loneliness improve consumers' negative attitudes towards online shopping. The results show that retailers need to pay attention to the differentiated layouts of diverse shopping channels, improve the communication skills of retail service personnel, strengthen the integration of online and offline channels, and pay more attention to the treatment and compensation of bad online shopping experience.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103125","20230101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-28","",38321,""
"Structural analysis of cotton stalk Puller and Shredder Machine","World scenario after pandemic COVID-19 has been drastically changing and researchers more focusing on, to minimize the post-pandemic effects on economy, energy sustainability and food security. Agriculture sector is playing pivotal role in world food security and energy sustainability. There is high need to optimize the mechanization technologies to increase the yield in limited energy inputs and operation time to fulfill the world growing food demand. This research is mainly focused on the design development and structural analysis aiding with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) approach for Cotton Stalk Puller and Shredder machine (CSPS) to cut the crop leftovers, soil conditioning (shredding the plant waste into soil) and sowing of next crop in single run by conserving input resources. The experimental trials revealed that there is high pressure on cutting blades, chocking of shredder section and excessive pulling load on tractor hitches, which affected the machineâ€™s performance. To mitigate deficiencies and design optimization to improve the machine safety/reliability, the structure analysis carried out. Six core components of machine including baseplate, blade, gear system, root digger, pulley and shaft has investigated as per field conditions. The results revealed that the material of blade, root digger and teeth of gear system receiving the high stress under the operational conditions which results the edge wear and damage. The carbonization up to one-millimeter thickness can provide the extra strength to bear the excessive load on edge layers.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2022.09.002","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-28","",38322,""
