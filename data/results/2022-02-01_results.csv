"Effects of the Early Phase of COVID-19 on the Autistic Community in Sweden: A Qualitative Multi-Informant Study Linking to ICF","While the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, early outcome studies indicate severe and pervasive global effects of the pandemic and associated measures to prevent the spread of the virus. General population studies, as well as insight into the outcomes for particular groups, will be necessary in order to mitigate potentially long-term effects as well as to prepare for future epidemics or pandemics. The pandemic conditions have been marked by rapid and abrupt changes and unpredictability which are circumstances that leave the autistic population particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes following the distinctive features of the diagnosis. Studies are only beginning to delineate the outcomes of the global autism community and the present study adds to these findings by providing a local, multi-perspective, qualitative analysis of the lived experiences of the Swedish autism community. In this study, autistic youth and adults, caregivers of autistic individuals, as well as representatives of Swedish interest organizations were interviewed. Thematic analysis was performed on the population as a whole and patterns of results were formalized according to the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF-CY). Participants report wide-ranging adverse outcomes of the pandemic relating to mental health and access to support, participation in daily activities and socialization, education, and work as well as parental resources. However, participants also report positive outcomes relating to a reduction in specific social and everyday demands, and normalization of lived experiences. Additionally, interviews outlined some strategies used to cope during pandemic conditions. Implications of these findings are discussed.","Fridell, Anna, Norrman, Hjalmar Nobel, Girke, Linda, BÃ¶lte, Sven","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031268","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1268, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26262,""

"Comparison of The Anxiety and Depression Levels of Pregnant Women With COVID-19 and Healthy Pregnant Women","In our study, it was planned to compare the anxiety and depression levels of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, the sociodemographic characteristics that may be associated, and the change in anxiety and depression levels after the disease regressed. There were a total of 158 participants, including 63 patients and 95 controls participating in the study. The mean age was 28.61+/- 6.47 years. Pregnant women with COVID-19 and recommended follow-up and treatment between May 2020 and August 2020 were included in the study. Sociodemographic data form, Beck Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Scale, State and Trait Anxiety Scale prepared by researchers were filled with patients who volunteered to participate in the study. The scales indicated were repeated when the patients came to their first check-up after fifteen days from discharge. There is a statistically significant difference between the COVID-19 diagnostic groups in terms of Anxiety score (p &lt;0.05). While the anxiety level was the highest in the COVID-19 positive diagnosis group (10.38), it was lower in the COVID-19 positive control group (5.7). According to multiple comparison results;There is a difference between the COVID-19 positive diagnosis group and the control and negative groups (p &lt;0.05). There is a statistically significant difference between the COVID-19 diagnostic groups in terms of Depression score (p &lt;0.05). While the Depression level was highest in the COVID-19 positive diagnosis group (9.51), it was lower in the COVID-19 positive control group (5.8). There is a difference between the COVID-19 positive diagnosis group and the control and negative groups (p &lt;0.05). There is a difference between the COVID-19 positive diagnosis group and the control group (p &lt;0.05). This study showed us that COVID-19 infection increases anxiety and depression in pregnant women, and anxiety and depression are highest at the first diagnosis of the disease, especially in pregnant women with COVID-19.

"Changes in Suicide Rate and Characteristics According to Age of Suicide Attempters before and after COVID-19","This study aims to identify age-related suicide-related factors and changes in suicide rate before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From 2018 to 2020, the patients who presented to the ED of a university hospital with a suicide attempt were classified into adolescents (&le;18 years), adults (19&ndash;65 years), and elderly (&gt;65 years), and the visits were grouped into before and after COVID-19. Results: There were 853 visits before and 388 visits after COVID-19, and the results showed that the number of adolescent and adult suicide patients increased immediately after the pandemic, but the overall trend did not show a significant difference from before the pandemic. In the adolescents, the ratio of male patients increased, interpersonal and school-related motivations decreased, the poisoning and cutting methods of suicide were more common, and hospitalization admissions increased. Among the elderly, the ratio of female patients increased, the number of single patients and patients without previous psychiatric problems increased, the motives for physical illness and death of people around increased, the falling and hanging methods of suicide were more common, and hospitalization admissions and deaths increased. Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 on suicide rates and suicide-related factors varies by age group. This finding requires different approaches and methods to suicide prevention based on age.","Kim, Min-Jung, Paek, So-Hyun, Kwon, Jae-Hyun, Park, Soo-Hyun, Chung, Hyun-Jung, Byun, Young-Hoon","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9020151","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Children; 9(2):151, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26265,""
"Change in Depression and Its Determinants during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Examination among Racially/Ethnically Diverse US Adults","This study examined longitudinal data to identify changes in the occurrence of depressive symptoms, and to explore if such changes were associated with socio-demographic, movement behaviors, and health variables during the COVID-19 pandemic, among a diverse sample of central Texas residents. Participants who completed two online surveys in 2020 (in June and November) from an on-going longitudinal study were included. Depressive symptoms were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Change in depressive symptoms&rsquo;occurrence status between the two time points was categorized into (1) stable/improved, and (2) consistent depressive symptoms/declined. Sociodemographic factors, movement behaviors and health data were self-reported. Statistical analyses utilized descriptive statistics and logistical regression. Among a total of 290 individuals (84.1% female;71.0% racial/ethnic minorities), 13.5% were categorized as consistent depressive symptoms/declined. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that racial/ethnic minorities, older age, and increased physical activity were associated with a lower likelihood, while greater sedentary time was associated with higher likelihood of consistent depressive symptoms/declined status. Between 3 months and 8 months into the pandemic, various socio-demographic and behavioral variables were associated with changes in depressive symptoms&rsquo;occurrence status. Future research should explore the longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on depression among a diverse population and identify risk factors for depression.","Zhang, Yuzi, Janda, Kathryn M.; Ranjit, Nalini, Salvo, Deborah, Nielsen, Aida, van den Berg, Alexandra","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031194","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1194, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26266,""
"Clinical and demographic differences in the willingness to use self-administered at-home COVID-19 testing measures among persons with opioid use disorder","<i>Background:</i> COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting disadvantaged populations, including persons with opioid use disorder (OUD). Persons with OUD are at greater risk for direct (e.g., COVID-19 diagnosis, severe symptoms) and indirect consequences (relapse, overdose) of COVID-19. Given stay at home orders, at-home testing options may serve as a viable tool to curb the increase in COVID-19 transmission and adverse effects of COVID-19. <i>Methods:</i> From May to September 2020, we surveyed 110 persons in treatment for OUD about their willingness to use various self-administered at-home COVID-19 testing measures. Participants were stratified by age, gender, and racial-ethnic identity to observe differences in willingness to use COVID-19 tests. The three COVID-19 tests included a throat swab sample, a saliva-based sample, and a blood prick test. <i>Results:</i> A high willingness to use at-home COVID-19 tests was observed in patients in treatment for OUD. A greater proportion of females were willing to use a saliva-based test; greater proportions of White participants were willing to use a saliva based COVID-19 test compared to racial-ethnic minorities. Older aged participants (Ã¢â€°Â¥45Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) reported greater rates of willingness to use a self-administered at home blood prick test for COVID-19. <i>Conclusions:</i> At-home testing measures for COVID-19 appear highly acceptable among people with OUD.","Mistler, Sullivan, Wickersham, Copenhaver, Shrestha","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2021.2007511","20220131","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; health disparities; opioid use disorder; specimen collection; test","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26267,""
"Balancing the Freedom-Security Trade-Off During Crises and Disasters","During crises and disasters, such as hurricanes, terrorist threats, or pandemics, policymakers must often increase security at the cost of freedom. Psychological science, however, has shown that the restriction of freedom may have strong negative consequences for behavior and health. We suggest that psychology can inform policy both by elucidating some negative consequences of lost freedom (e.g., depression or behavioral reactance) and by revealing strategies to address them. We propose four interlocking principles that can help policymakers restore the freedom-security balance. Careful consideration of the psychology of freedom can help policymakers develop policies that most effectively promote public health, safety, and well-being when crises and disasters strike.","Cheek, Reutskaja, Schwartz","https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916211034499","20220131","COVID-19; framing; freedom; public health; security","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26268,""
"People's lived experience with an eating disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: A joint virtual issue of research published in leading eating disorder journals","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted people's daily life and contributed to adverse health and mental health outcomes. People with pre-existing mental health conditions are particularly likely to experience symptom exacerbation. Complementing the adverse impacts of the pandemic are eating disorder specific risk factors for worsening of eating disorder symptoms and/or impeding treatment progress and recovery. For this joint Virtual Issue, we selected 15 articles that have been published in two leading journals in the field of eating disorders (International Journal of Eating Disorders and Journal of Eating Disorders) to highlight studies that offer information about individuals' lived experience with an eating disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. In these studies, most participants reported worsening of eating disorder symptoms which they attributed to challenges arising from changes in daily routines including eating and exercise related habits, increased stress, and diminished social contacts. These research findings reported a mixed picture about patients' perceptions of the ease of the transition to virtual delivery of treatment and the quality of care they received during the pandemic. Qualitative studies suggested strategies for supporting people with eating disorders during pandemic conditions, with some of these holding promise for improving care for individuals who experience an eating disorder.","Weissman, Hay","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23653","20220131","COVID-19; eating disorder; health; lived experience; mental health treatment; treatment outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26269,""
"Reasons for Suicide During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","Although the suicide rate in Japan increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reasons for suicide have yet to be comprehensively investigated. To assess which reasons for suicide had rates that exceeded the expected number of suicide deaths for that reason during the COVID-19 pandemic. This national, population-based cross-sectional study of data on suicides gathered by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare from January 2020 to May 2021 used a times-series analysis on the numbers of reason-identified suicides. Data of decedents were recorded by the National Police Agency and compiled by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. For category analysis, we compared data from January 2020 to May 2021 with data from December 2014 to June 2020. For subcategory analysis, data from January 2020 to May 2021 were compared with data from January 2019 to June 2020. The main outcome was the monthly excess suicide rate, ie, the difference between the observed number of monthly suicide deaths and the upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI for the expected number of suicide deaths in that month. Reasons for suicide were categorized into family, health, economy, work, relationships, school, and others, which were further divided into 52 subcategories. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate the expected number of monthly suicides. Individual regression models were used for each of the 7 categories, 52 subcategories, men, women, and both genders. From the 29Ã¢â‚¬Â¯938 suicides (9984 [33.3%] women; 1093 [3.7%] aged &lt;20 years; 3147 [10.5%] aged &gt;80 years), there were 21Ã¢â‚¬Â¯027 reason-identified suicides (7415 [35.3%] women). For both genders, all categories indicated monthly excess suicide rates, except for school in men. October 2020 had the highest excess suicide rates for all cases (observed, 1577; upper bound of 95% CI for expected number of suicides, 1254; 25.8% greater). In men, the highest monthly excess suicide rate was 24.3% for the other category in August 2020 (observed, 87; upper bound of 95% CI for expected number, 70); in women, it was 85.7% for school in August 2020 (observed, 26; upper bound of 95% CI for expected number, 14). In this study, observed suicides corresponding to all 7 categories of reasons exceeded the monthly estimates (based on data from before or during the COVID-19 pandemic), except for school-related reasons in men. This study can be used as a basis for developing intervention programs for suicide prevention.","Koda, Harada, Eguchi, Nomura, Ishida","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.45870","20220131","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26270,""
"Parent work-life conflict and adolescent adjustment during COVID-19: Mental health and parenting as mediators","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented challenging time for parents and adolescents. The present study examines the role of parent work-life conflict on adolescent adjustment (i.e., academic engagement and mental health) and family processes (i.e., parental mental health and parenting) as potential mediators for this association. A total of 692 middle school students (53.2% boys; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 13.54 years, <i>SD</i><sub>age</sub> = 0.58) and their parents (29.6% fathers and 70.4% mothers; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 44.75 years, <i>SD</i><sub>age</sub> = 4.14 years) completed an online survey in May 2020 in Beijing, China. Results indicated that many parents (24.6%) experienced work-life conflicts amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings also showed that parent work-life conflict was negatively associated with youth academic engagement and mental health indirectly through parental mental health difficulties and parenting behavior (parental control, autonomy granting, and parental involvement). In addition, parental mental health difficulties had direct and indirect effects on youth adjustment via parenting behaviors, such that parental involvement and autonomy granting predicted greater academic engagement and covitality (co-occurrence of positive traits and positive mental health), whereas the parental control predicted youth mental health difficulties. Our findings extend prior research by examining the pathways linking parental work-life conflict to youth adjustment during COVID-19. Findings are discussed in terms of how to better support families and promote better youth academic engagement and well-being during COVID-19.

"Health visiting in England: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","This focused review of evidence considers the impact of the pandemic in 2020 on families with children under 5 years in England, and the health visiting (HV) service that supports them. . Data were drawn from national surveys of health visitors (HVs) and parents, a freedom of information request of employers, published research, and national data. Framework analysis and triangulation, using the Key Elements of an effective HV service, were used to categorize the key findings. The findings from the review indicate that the impacts of the pandemic were wide-ranging and disproportionately affected the most disadvantaged families, increasing demand for HV support. HVs' ability to respond was compromised due to national policy decisions to partially stop the service and variations in local implementation including the redeployment of HVs, pre-existing workforce capacity issues, and the effectiveness of innovations to identify and support vulnerable families. The pandemic exacerbated factors that can lead to poorer outcomes for families. Key learning from the pandemic response, including the need to prioritize the HV service, must be acted upon to reduce ongoing impacts now and ensure that the service is equipped for future emergencies.","Morton, Adams","https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.13053","20220131","COVID-19; Child abuse prevention and control; child welfare; early childhood; health visitor; maternal mental health; pediatric care; public health nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26272,""
"Outcomes in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) at 6 months post-infection part 2: Psychological functioning","Limited research investigating the long-term psychological and emotional correlates of COVID-19 infection has been completed. The current study begins to address this limitation in patients experiencing Post-Acute Sequelae SARS-CoV-2 (PASC; e.g. ""Long COVID""). Participants were 43 consecutive neuropsychological outpatients diagnosed with PASC and who completed the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). The sample was predominantly female (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36) and white (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32). Effect sizes compared to the normative mean T scores and base rates of elevated (TÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°69) scores were calculated. PAI scales measuring somatic preoccupation and depression had large effect sizes and the highest base rates of scale elevations, with the mean T score at approximately the normative cutoff for clinical significance (TÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°70). The Schizophrenia Thought Disorder subscale (SCZ-T) also had a large effect size and high base rate of elevation, likely reflecting cognitive concerns. Scales measuring anxiety had medium effect sizes. The other PAI scales generally had small to negligible effect sizes. There were no significant differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants on the PAI. Overall, PAI scales measuring psychological distress, particularly somatic preoccupation and depression, were the most frequently elevated in the participants. The specific reasons for somatic preoccupation could not be determined in this study. Potential explanations include a vulnerability to distress in Long COVID patients, premorbid somatic preoccupation perhaps motivating these patients to seek clinical attention, or socioenvironmental factors leading some COVID patients to be somatically preoccupied with minor physiological changes and attribute those changes to COVID-19.","Whiteside, Naini, Basso, Waldron, Holker, Porter, Niskanen, Melnik, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2022.2030411","20220131","COVID-19; Personality Assessment Inventory; psychological functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26273,""
"Understanding and managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on patients with epilepsy","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represented a relevant issue for people with epilepsy (PwE). Medical care and social restrictions exposed PwE to a high risk of seizure worsening. Medical institutions answered to the pandemic assuring only emergency care and implementing a remote assistance that highlighted the technological obsolescence of the medical care paradigms for PwE. We reviewed the literature on the COVID-19-related factors influencing the epilepsy course, from the evidence of seizure risk in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected PwE to anti-Sars-Cov-2 drugs interactions with antiseizure medications and the perceived changes of seizures in PwE. COVID-19 pandemic was a problematic experience for PwE.

"Intimate partner violence and COVID-19 among reproductive age women: A community-based cross-sectional survey, Ethiopia","Intimate partner violence is one of the most common psychological, physical, and sexual assaults toward women which suit the entire life of women, and nowadays, the magnitude accelerates due to coronavirus pandemic. Hence, this study was aimed to examine the prevalence of intimate partner violence and predictors during coronavirus among childbearing-age residents in Debre Berhan. A community-based cross-sectional survey was employed from 1 May to 1 July 2020. Eight items of women abuse screening tool were used to estimate intimate partner violence. Trained data collectors directly interview randomly selected participants. The data were entered using Epi-info V. 7 and analyzed using SPSS V. 23. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of intimate partner violence and the frequency distribution of other variables. During bivariate analysis, predictor variables with a <i>p</i>-value less than 0.25 were nominated to further analysis. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used and a <i>p</i>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 700 participants were included with a response rate of 95.1%. The prevalence of intimate partner violence in the past single year was 19% with 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.1-21.9. Besides, the prevalence of emotional (19.9%, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.9-22.8), sexual (10.9%, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.6-13.2) and physical (9.4%, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.3-11.6) violence was reported. Women with depressive symptoms, overweight, suicidal ideation, and body image disturbance were significantly associated with intimate partner violence, but not educational status, employment, income, stressful life events, lifetime alcohol use, suicidal attempt, and abortion. Nearly one out of five interviewed participants had intimate partner violence. Being overweight, having poor body image, and having depression increase intimate partner violence. Special preventive measures and treatment, and other legal services should be taken to alleviate the predictor variables and intimate partner violence.","Shewangzaw Engda, Dargie Wubetu, Kasahun Amogne, Moltot Kitaw","https://doi.org/10.1177/17455065211068980","20220131","COVID-19; Ethiopia; intimate partner violence; reproductive age; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26275,""

Moderate-to-severe psychological distress was reported by 257 (68.9%) survivors and was associated with an incomeÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°$60,000 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.15, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.11-4.17) and the presence of a pre-existing chronic physical health condition (AOR 2.05, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.18-3.56). Loneliness was reported by 204 (54.0%) survivors and was associated with being unemployed (AOR 2.26 95%CI 1.18-4.31), pandemic causing finances to be worse (AOR 1.82, 95%CI 1.08-3.06) and the presence of a pre-pandemic mental health condition (AOR 1.88, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.03-3.42). Clinical insomnia was reported by 74 (19.5%) survivors and was associated with employment status as a student (AOR 3.00, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.08-8.29) or unemployed (AOR 3.97, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.46-10.83), earning $60,000 or more in the year 2020 (AOR 4.36, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.43-13.32), having haematologic cancer (AOR 2.21, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.05-4.70) and being single (AOR 2.52, 95%Ã‚Â CI 1.08-5.91). Pandemic negatively affected employment, finances, physical activity, cancer care and substance use for 73.9%, 66.5%, 32.5%, 21.8% and 19.2% of survivors, respectively. Worries about finances, contracting COVID-19, cancer treatment increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection, and having poor health outcomes from contracting COVID-19 were reported by 46.0%, 45.6%, 55.0% and 47.3% of survivors, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on AYA cancer survivors, and these individuals report high levels of psychological distress, insomnia and loneliness. Cancer survivors are at risk for worsening mental and physical health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted interventions and support programs are urgently needed to support the mental health of AYA cancer survivors and optimize their health outcomes.","Yan, Howden, Mahar, Scott, Glidden, Deleemans, Chalifour, Eaton, Gupta, Bolton, Garland, Oberoi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-021-01158-9","20220131","Adolescents and young adults; COVID-19; Cancer; Oncology; Pandemic; Survivorship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26277,""
"Online Learning Satisfaction and Internet Addiction During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Two-Wave Longitudinal Study","Stay-at-home orders and quarantines have not only shifted traditional face-to-face learning to online learning, but have also led to greatly increased consumption of digital devices during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Thus, many students who were new to online learning were forced into a new environment. The purpose of this two-wave longitudinal study is to investigate the effects of internet addiction on online students' learning satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of two hundred and forty-nine undergraduate-level students from 51 of the 81 cities in Turkey completed an online questionnaire. The data used cross-lagged structural equation modeling. The results indicated that internet addiction at Time 1 decreased online students' learning satisfaction at Time 2. The results also revealed that online students' learning satisfaction (Time 1) did not affect internet addiction (Time 2). It is concluded that internet-addicted students had lower learning satisfaction in online learning environments. Thus, it is essential for institutions to provide effective online instruction, psychological coping tools, and social and behavioral support, which may help reduce internet addiction and minimize its negative impacts on online learning environments during the pandemic.","Besalti, Satici","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-022-00697-x","20220131","COVID-19; Internet addiction; Longitudinal; Online learning satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26278,""

"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women Pregnant Following Infertility Treatment: A Longitudinal Study","To compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological health of infertility patients who have become pregnant to women who have not. Prospective cohort study from April to June 2020. Participants completed three questionnaires over this period. A single large, university-affiliated infertility practice. 443 pregnant women and 1476 women still experiencing infertility who completed all three questionnaires. None. Patient-reported primary stressor over three months of the first major COVID-19 surge. Further data on self-reported sadness, anxiety, loneliness and the use of personal use of coping strategies. Pregnant participants were significantly less likely to report taking an antidepressant(p&lt;0.01) or anxiolytic medication (p&lt;0.001), to have a prior diagnosis of depression (p&lt;0.01), were more likely to cite COVID-19 as a top stressor (p&lt;0.001) and overall were less likely to practice stress-relieving activities during the first surge. Women pregnant following infertility treatment cited the pandemic as their top stressor and were more distressed about the pandemic than their non-pregnant counterparts but were less likely to be engaging in stress-relieving activities. Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic, infertility patients pregnant after treatment should be counseled and encouraged to practice specific stress-reduction strategies.","Domar, Shah, Gompers, Meyers, Khodakhah, Hacker, Penzias, Sakkas, Toth, Vaughan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xfre.2022.01.004","20220131","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; distress; infertility; pregnancy; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26280,""
"Educational Anomaly Analytics: Features, Methods, and Challenges","Anomalies in education affect the personal careers of students and universities' retention rates. Understanding the laws behind educational anomalies promotes the development of individual students and improves the overall quality of education. However, the inaccessibility of educational data hinders the development of the field. Previous research in this field used questionnaires, which are time- and cost-consuming and hardly applicable to large-scale student cohorts. With the popularity of educational management systems and the rise of online education during the prevalence of COVID-19, a large amount of educational data is available online and offline, providing an unprecedented opportunity to explore educational anomalies from a data-driven perspective. As an emerging field, educational anomaly analytics rapidly attracts scholars from a variety of fields, including education, psychology, sociology, and computer science. This paper intends to provide a comprehensive review of data-driven analytics of educational anomalies from a methodological standpoint. We focus on the following five types of research that received the most attention: course failure prediction, dropout prediction, mental health problems detection, prediction of difficulty in graduation, and prediction of difficulty in employment. Then, we discuss the challenges of current related research. This study aims to provide references for educational policymaking while promoting the development of educational anomaly analytics as a growing field.","Guo, Bai, Tian, Firmin, Xia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2021.811840","20220131","anomaly analytics; anomaly detection; data science; educational big data; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26281,""
"5-min mindfulness audio induction alleviates psychological distress and sleep disorders in patients with COVID-19","Mindfulness meditation is beneficial to mitigate the negative effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the general population, but no study examined such meditation in the COVID-19 patients themselves. To explore the short-term efficacy of mindfulness meditation in alleviating psychological distress and sleep disorders in patients with COVID-19. This prospective study enrolled patients with mild COVID-19 treated at Wuhan Fangcang Hospital in February 2020. The patients were voluntarily divided into either a mindfulness or a conventional intervention group. The patients were evaluated before/after the intervention using the Short Inventory of Mindfulness Capability (SMI-C), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Seventy-five participants were enrolled in this study, with 43 and 32 in the mindfulness and conventional groups, respectively. Before the intervention, there were no differences in SMI-C, HADS, or PSQI scores between the two groups. After the 2-wk intervention, the mindfulness level (from 30.16 Ã‚Â± 5.58 to 35.23 Ã‚Â± 5.95, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and sleep quality (from 12.85 Ã‚Â± 3.06 to 9.44 Ã‚Â± 3.86, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly increased in the mindfulness group. There were no differences in the conventional group. After the intervention, the mindfulness level (35.23 Ã‚Â± 5.95 <i>vs</i> 31.17 Ã‚Â± 6.50, <i>P</i> = 0.006) and sleep quality (9.44 Ã‚Â± 3.86 <i>vs</i> 11.87 Ã‚Â± 4.06, <i>P</i> = 0.011) were significantly higher in the mindfulness group than in the conventional group. Depression decreased in the mindfulness group (from 14.15 Ã‚Â± 3.21 to 12.50 Ã‚Â± 4.01, <i>P</i> = 0.038), but there was no difference between the two groups.

"Serial-Multiple Mediation of Job Burnout and Fatigue in the Relationship Between Sickness Presenteeism and Productivity Loss in Nurses: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study","In China, sickness presenteeism, job burnout, and fatigue are common among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose the prevalence of sickness presenteeism can adversely affect nurses' physical and mental health, negatively impact their work productivity and quality, and pose a threat to patients' safety. Therefore, this study examines the mechanism of productivity loss caused by sickness presenteeism, fatigue, and job burnout. To investigate the serial-multiple mediating effect of job burnout and fatigue in the relationship between sickness presenteeism and productivity loss among nurses. A multicenter cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering an online questionnaire from December 2020 to May 2021. Stratified cluster sampling was used to include 3,491 nurses from 14 hospitals in Shandong Province, China. Variables were measured using the Sickness Presenteeism Questionnaire, Stanford Presenteeism Scale, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, independent-samples <i>t</i>-test, Pearson correlation analysis, hierarchical regression, and bootstrapping method. From the 3,491 nurses who volunteered in this online survey, only 2,968 valid questionnaires were returned. Sickness presenteeism exhibited a prevalence of 70.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic. The average score of health-related productivity loss was 15.05 Ã‚Â± 4.52, fatigue was 8.48 Ã‚Â± 3.40, and job burnout was 39.14 Ã‚Â± 19.64. Sickness presenteeism was positively associated with fatigue and job burnout while job burnout was positively associated with nurse fatigue. Sickness presenteeism, fatigue, and job burnout were also positively correlated with health-related productivity loss. Statistically significant paths via the single mediation of fatigue and job burnout were established. A statistically significant serial-multiple mediating effect of fatigue and job burnout on the association between sickness presenteeism and productivity loss accounted for 35.12% of the total effect size. There was a high incidence of sickness presenteeism and job burnout among Chinese nurses. High-frequency sickness presenteeism may result in increased productivity loss through the two mediating effects of fatigue and job burnout. Sickness presenteeism may increase fatigue, promote job burnout, and result in increased productivity loss among Chinese nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Guo, Wang, Lv, Li, Guan, Li, Li, Cao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.812737","20220131","China; burnout; cross-sectional studies; fatigue; mediation analysis; nurses; presenteeism; productivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26283,""
"Student Burnout and PTSD Symptoms: The Role of Existential Anxiety and Academic Fears on Students during the COVID 19 Pandemic","It is well known that student burnout is a serious mental health problem, caused by chronic stress related to the educational area. However, in the COVID 19 pandemic, young people have to struggle with additional threats that affect their overall functioning and perception of the world. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating effects of existential anxiety and academic fears on the relationship between academic burnout and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The findings confirmed that academic burnout, existential anxiety, and academic fear were significantly associated with higher posttraumatic symptoms. Existential anxiety and academic fear played a mediating role in the association between academic burnout and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. In conclusion, it is considered that student burnout and anxiety indicators are important risk factors for the trauma experienced by students and may increase its symptoms.","Tomaszek, Muchacka-Cymerman","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6979310","20220131","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26284,""
"The early impact of the global lockdown on post-secondary students and staff: A global, descriptive study","The aim of this study was to gain a preliminary, broad-level understanding of how the first lockdown impacted post-secondary students, faculty, and staff worldwide. The data were obtained via a global online cross-sectional questionnaire survey using a mixed-method design and disseminated to university students, faculty, and staff from April to November 2020. The data were categorized in four themes/categories: (1) social life and relationships, (2) access to services, (3) health experiences, and (4) impact on mental health well-being. The survey included 27,804 participants from 121 countries and 6 continents. The majority of participants were from Europe (73.6%), female (59.2%), under 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age (64.0%), living in large urban areas (61.3%), %), and from middle-income families (66.7%). Approximately 28.4% of respondents reported that the lockdown negatively impacted their social life, while 21.2% reported the lockdown had a positive impact. A total of 39.2% reported having issues accessing products or services, including essentials, such as groceries, or medical services. In addition, respondents reported an increase in stress and anxiety levels and a decrease in quality of life during the first 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of the lockdown.

"Risk and protective factors for the possible development of post-traumatic stress disorder among intensive care professionals in France during the first peak of the COVID-19 epidemic","Intensive care units (ICU) are among the healthcare services most affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Stressors related to insecurity, unpredictability, patient death and family distress are significant, and put healthcare workers (HCWs) at high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aims of this study were to measure the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in HCWs and to identify risk factors and protective factors during the epidemic in France. During the first peak of the epidemic (from 22 April to 13 May 2020), we assessed sources of stress (PS-ICU scale), mental health (GHQ-12) and coping strategies (Brief-COPE). Three months later (03 June to 6 July 2020), PTSD was assessed using the IES-R scale, with additional questions about sources of support. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires administered online. Among 2153 professionals who participated in the study, 20.6% suffered from potential PTSD, mostly intrusion symptoms. Risk factors for the development of PTSD were having experienced additional difficult events during the crisis, having a high level of psychological distress, a high level of perceived stress related to the workload and human resources issues, the emotional burden related to the patient and family, and stressors specific to COVID-19 during the first peak of the crisis. The use of positive thinking coping strategies decreased the relationship between perceived stress and the presence of PTSD, while social support seeking strategies increased the relationship. Finally, the HCWs preferred to use support from colleagues, relatives and/or a psychologist, and very few used the telephone hotlines. The epidemic has had a strong traumatic impact on intensive care HCWs. Given the risk of PTSD, we need to consider implementing easily-accessible support services that focus on positive thinking coping strategies, during and after the crisis. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Las unidades de cuidados intensivos (UCIs) se encuentran dentro de los servicios de salud mÃƒÂ¡s comprometidos por la crisis de la COVID-19. Los factores estresantes asociados a la inseguridad, la impredecibilidad, el fallecimiento de pacientes y la angustia familiar son considerables y colocan a los trabajadores de salud (TS) en un alto riesgo de trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (TEPT). Los objetivos de este estudio fueron el determinar la prevalencia del trastorno por estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico en TS e identificar los factores de riesgo y los factores protectores durante la epidemia en Francia.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos:</b> Durante la primera ola de la epidemia (del 22 de abril al 13 de mayo del 2020) evaluamos fuentes de estrÃƒÂ©s (mediante la escala de percepciÃƒÂ³n de factores estresantes en la UCI; PS-ICU en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s), salud mental (mediante el cuestionario de salud general de 12 ÃƒÂ­tems; GHQ-12 en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) y estrategias de afrontamiento (mediante el inventario de la orientaciÃƒÂ³n del afrontamiento ante los problemas experimentados; Brief-COPE en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s). Tres meses despuÃƒÂ©s (del 3 de junio al 6 de julio del 2020) se evaluÃƒÂ³ el TEPT mediante la escala de impacto del evento (IES-R en sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) y con preguntas adicionales respecto a las fuentes de soporte. Se recolectÃƒÂ³ la informaciÃƒÂ³n mediante cuestionarios de autoreporte realizados en lÃƒÂ­nea.<b>Resultados:</b> De los 2.153 profesionales que participaron en el estudio, 20,6% padecÃƒÂ­an un potencial TEPT, predominando los sÃƒÂ­ntomas intrusivos. Los factores de riesgo para el desarrollo del TEPT fueron el haber experimentado eventos difÃƒÂ­ciles adicionales durante la crisis, el tener un nivel elevado de angustia psicolÃƒÂ³gica, un nivel alto de estrÃƒÂ©s percibido asociado a la carga laboral y a situaciones asociadas a los recursos humanos, la carga emocional relacionada al paciente y su familia, y los factores estresantes especÃƒÂ­ficos de la COVID-19 durante la primera ola de la crisis. El uso del pensamiento positivo como estrategia de afrontamiento disminuÃƒÂ­a la relaciÃƒÂ³n entre el estrÃƒÂ©s percibido y la presencia del TEPT, mientras que las estrategias relacionadas con la bÃƒÂºsqueda de soporte social incrementaban esta relaciÃƒÂ³n. Finalmente, los TS preferÃƒÂ­an emplear el soporte brindado por sus colegas, familiares y/o un psicÃƒÂ³logo, mientras que muy pocos preferÃƒÂ­an el uso de lÃƒÂ­neas telefÃƒÂ³nicas de crisis.<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n:</b> La epidemia ha tenido un fuerte impacto traumÃƒÂ¡tico sobre los TS de las UCIs. Dado el riesgo de TEPT, se necesita considerar la implementaciÃƒÂ³n de servicios de apoyo de fÃƒÂ¡cil acceso que se enfoquen en el empleo del pensamiento positivo como estrategia de afrontamiento, tanto durante como despuÃƒÂ©s de la crisis. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯:</b> Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§â€ºâ€˜Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Ë†Â¿ (ICU) Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Ââ€” COVID-19 Ã¥ÂÂ±Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¥ÂÂ¥Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Â®â€°Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¦â€žÅ¸, Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Â­Â»Ã¤ÂºÂ¡Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§â€”â€ºÃ¨â€¹Â¦Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦Â, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜Ëœ (HCW) Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢Â (PTSD) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â«ËœÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢:</b> Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ©Â«ËœÃ¥Â³Â°Ã¦Å“Å¸ (2020 Ã¥Â¹Â´ 4 Ã¦Å“Ë† 22 Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¨â€¡Â³ 5 Ã¦Å“Ë† 13 Ã¦â€”Â¥), Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂ (PS-ICU Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨), Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ· (GHQ-12) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Â­â€“Ã§â€¢Â¥ (Brief-COPE) Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸â€°Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Å“Ë†Ã¥ÂÅ½ (2020 Ã¥Â¹Â´ 6 Ã¦Å“Ë† 3 Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¨â€¡Â³ 7 Ã¦Å“Ë† 6 Ã¦â€”Â¥), Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨ IES-R Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¤Âºâ€  PTSD, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã©â„¢â€žÃ¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã§Â®Â¡Ã§Ââ€ Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¦â€Â¶Ã©â€ºâ€ Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“:</b> Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Å¡â€ž 2153 Ã¥ÂÂÃ¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â¸Â­, 20.6%Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨ PTSD, Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã©â€”Â¯Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥ÂÂ±Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã©Â¢ÂÃ¥Â¤â€“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€ºÂ°Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶, Ã¦Å“â€°Ã©Â«ËœÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°, Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Å â€ºÃ¨Âµâ€žÃ¦ÂºÂÃ©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â«ËœÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬, Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¨Â´Å¸Ã¦â€¹â€¦, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥ÂÂ±Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ©Â«ËœÃ¥Â³Â°Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¤ÂºÅ½ COVID-19 Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¦ÂºÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦â‚¬ÂÃ¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Â­â€“Ã§â€¢Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¤Â¸Å½ PTSD Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â», Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Â¯Â»Ã¦Â±â€šÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â­â€“Ã§â€¢Â¥Ã¥Ë†â„¢Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã§Â§ÂÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥ÂÅ½, HCW Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦â€žÂ¿Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥ÂÅ’Ã¤Âºâ€¹, Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€™Å’/Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’Â, Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥Â°â€˜Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã§â€ÂµÃ¨Â¯ÂÃ§Æ’Â­Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº:</b> Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§â€ºâ€˜Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ©â€°Â´Ã¤ÂºÅ½ PTSD Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©, Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥ÂÂ±Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã¦â€“Â½Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦â‚¬ÂÃ¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Â­â€“Ã§â€¢Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Ëœâ€œÃ¨Å½Â·Ã¥Â¾â€”Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Laurent, Fournier, Lheureux, Poujol, Deltour, Ecarnot, Meunier-Beillard, Loiseau, Binquet, Quenot","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.2011603","20220131","Covid-19; ICU; PTSD; Stress; healthcare professional","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26286,""
"Anticipating PTSD in severe COVID survivors: the case for screen-and-treat","Based on research from previous pandemics, studies of critical care survivors, and emerging COVID-19 data, we estimate that up to 30% of survivors of severe COVID will develop PTSD. PTSD is frequently undetected across primary and secondary care settings and the psychological needs of survivors may be overshadowed by a focus on physical recovery. Delayed PTSD diagnosis is associated with poor outcomes. There is a clear case for survivors of severe COVID to be systematically screened for PTSD, and those that develop PTSD should receive timely access to evidence-based treatment for PTSD and other mental health problems by multidisciplinary teams. Basados en la investigaciÃƒÂ³n de pandemias previas, los estudios de los sobrevivientes a cuidados crÃƒÂ­ticos, y los datos emergentes de COVID-19, estimamos que hasta un 30% de los sobrevivientes del COVID grave desarrollarÃƒÂ¡n TEPT. El TEPT es frecuentemente subdetectado en los servicios de salud primarios y secundarios y las necesidades psicolÃƒÂ³gicas de los sobrevivientes puede verse eclipsadas por un enfoque en la recuperaciÃƒÂ³n fÃƒÂ­sica. El diagnÃƒÂ³stico tardÃƒÂ­o de TEPT se asocia con pobres resultados. Existe un caso claro para que los sobrevivientes del COVID grave sean evaluados sistemÃƒÂ¡ticamente para detectar el TEPT, y aquellos que desarrollan un TEPT deben tener acceso oportuno a tratamientos basados en la evidencia para el TEPT y para otros problemas de salud mental por equipos multidisciplinarios.

"Characterization of Wellbeing and its Relationship with Exposure to Violence in Mexican and Chilean Early and Late Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has generated negative psychological effects on the global population. In this context, one of the most vulnerable groups is adolescents, who have faced a range of challenging scenarios. The consequences of this pandemic for the wellbeing of adolescents need to be researched across countries. From this perspective, this study aims to characterize the wellbeing of adolescents from Mexico and Chile during the pandemic and delve into the relationship between victimization and the hedonic and eudaimonic types of wellbeing. Data from adolescent students (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3,275) were used, with the support of the Global Research Alliance. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted and their results indicated that: 1) Late adolescents scored lower on flourishing, and males scored higher than females. There was also a higher prevalence of languishing in late adolescents from both countries, as well as high levels of languishing in non-binary adolescents, especially in Chile; 2) There was a high prevalence of poly-victimization, with the highest percentage reported by females and the late adolescent group in both countries; 3) Non-victims had a higher probability of being in the flourishing group than victims in both countries; 4) Poly-victimization especially had an effect on the eudaimonic wellbeing of early adolescents and on the hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing of late adolescents in both countries. Implications related to the mental health policies for adolescence are discussed in terms of how to increase adolescent wellbeing.","Bravo-Sanzana, Oriol, Miranda","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12187-021-09905-1","20220131","Adolescents; Eudaimonic; Hedonic; Victimization; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26288,""
"The Relationship Among Spirituality, Fear, and Mental Health on COVID-19 Among Adults: An Exploratory Research","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impactful on all aspects of individuals' lives, particularly mental health due to the fear and spirituality associated with the pandemic. Thus, purpose of this study was to identify the relationship among fear, spirituality, and mental health on COVID-19 among adults in Malaysia. This study also examines spirituality as a mediator in relationship between fear and mental health. The study involved around 280 adults in Malaysia. This research is a quantitative study. Data analysis method (SEM-PLS) has been used for data analysis. Based on descriptive analysis, mental health questionnaire indicated that 60.0% of them are at a poor level of mental health whereas 57.5% of respondents showed a moderate level of COVID-19 fear, and 60.4% of respondents owned moderate level of spiritual well-being. The results also demonstrated that respondents that have a high level of fear would have a high level of mental health; interestingly, those with a high level of spirituality will have a lower level of mental health. Findings indicated that spirituality significantly mediated the relationship between fear and mental health. This research will help to demonstrate how important spirituality values to control mental health to be more positive among adults in Malaysia. The main contributions of this study are to help come out with new intervention method for those who are mentally ill and need help.","Rathakrishnan, Singh, Yahaya, Kamaluddin, Aziz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.815332","20220131","COVID-19; adults; fear; mental health; spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26289,""
"Does It Pay to Treat Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019? Social Perception of Physicians Treating Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the public has often expressed great appreciation toward medical personnel who were often shown in the media expressing strong emotions about the situation. To examine whether the perception of people on a physician is in fact influenced by whether the physician treats patients with COVID-19 and the emotions they expressed in response to the situation, 454 participants were recruited in May 2020. Participants saw facial expressions of anger, sadness, happiness, and neutrality which supposedly were shown by physicians who were presented as working either in COVID-19 wards or in an internal medicine ward. Participants rated how competent, empathetic, caring, and likable each physician was, to what degree they would wish to be treated by each physician, and what salary each physician deserved. Physicians treating patients with COVID-19 were seen more positively and as deserving higher pay; they appeared more competent, caring, likable, and were more likely to be chosen as a caregiver compared to physicians not treating patients with COVID-19. The expressed emotions of physicians had a strong impact on how they were perceived, yet this effect was largely unrelated to whether they treated patients with COVID-19 or not such that happy physicians seemed more empathetic, caring, and likable than the physicians who showed negative emotions. Positive regard toward physicians treating patients with COVID-19 was associated with the fact that they were seen as saving lives and not due to the risk imposed by their work.","Hareli, David, Basis, Hess","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.781220","20220131","COVID-19; attitudes; emotions; person perception; social perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26290,""
"Socioeconomic and Environmental Factors Associated With Increased Alcohol Purchase and Consumption in 38 Countries During the Covid-19 Pandemic","To explore changes in alcohol purchase and consumption during the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic, and assess associations between increased alcohol purchase/use and socioeconomic and environmental factors. Secondary data from a cross-sectional online survey conducted from 17 April to 25 June 2020. Thirty-eight countries from all continents of the world. A total of 37,206 adults (mean age:36.7, SD:14.8, 77% female) reporting alcohol purchasing and drinking habit before and during the pandemic. Changes in alcohol stock-up and frequency of alcohol use during the pandemic and increased alcohol stock-up and use were stratified by gender, age, education, household structure, working status, income loss, psychological distress, and country based on alcohol consumption per capita. The associations between increased alcohol stock-up/use and living with children, working from home, income loss and distress were examined using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for demographic factors. The majority of respondents reported no change in their alcohol purchasing and drinking habits during the early pandemic period. Increased drinking was reported by 20.2% of respondents, while 17.6% reported decreased alcohol use. More than half (53.3%) of respondents experienced psychological distress, with one in five (20.7%) having severe distress. Female gender, being aged under 50, higher educational attainment, living with children, working from home, and psychological distress were all independently associated with increased alcohol drinking during lockdown. Limitations of the study were the non-representative sample, the data collection early in the pandemic, and the non-standard measurement of alcohol consumption. Increased psychological distress among people during the early pandemic period, resulted in increased alcohol consumption, especially among women with children working from home during lockdown.","Kyaw Hla, Ramalho, Teunissen, Cuykx, Decorte, Pabian, Van Royen, De Backer, Gerritsen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.802037","20220131","Covid-19 pandemic; alcohol consumption/use; alcohol purchase; crisis; drinking; mental health; public health; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26291,""
"COVID-19-Related Mortality Risk in People With Severe Mental Illness: A Systematic and Critical Review","<b>Background:</b> Increasing clinical evidence suggests that people with severe mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Several systematic reviews examining the association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19-related mortality have recently been published. Although these reviews have been conducted thoroughly, certain methodological limitations may hinder the accuracy of their research findings. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic literature search, using the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (from inception to July 23, 2021), was conducted for observational studies assessing the risk of death associated with COVID-19 infection in adult patients with pre-existing schizophrenia spectrum disorders, BD, or MDD. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). <b>Results:</b> Of 1,446 records screened, 13 articles investigating the rates of death in patients with pre-existing SMI were included in this systematic review. Quality assessment scores of the included studies ranged from moderate to high. Most results seem to indicate that patients with SMI, particularly patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, are at significantly higher risk of COVID-19-related mortality, as compared to patients without SMI. However, the extent of the variation in COVID-19-related mortality rates between studies including people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was large because of a low level of precision of the estimated mortality outcome(s) in certain studies. Most studies on MDD and BD did not include specific information on the mood state or disease severity of patients. Due to a lack of data, it remains unknown to what extent patients with BD are at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. A variety of factors are likely to contribute to the increased mortality risk of COVID-19 in these patients. These include male sex, older age, somatic comorbidities (particularly cardiovascular diseases), as well as disease-specific characteristics. <b>Conclusion:</b> Methodological limitations hamper the accuracy of COVID-19-related mortality estimates for the main categories of SMIs. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that SMI is associated with excess COVID-19 mortality. Policy makers therefore must consider these vulnerable individuals as a high-risk group that should be given particular attention. This means that targeted interventions to maximize vaccination uptake among these patients are required to address the higher burden of COVID-19 infection in this already disadvantaged group.","De Hert, Mazereel, Stroobants, De Picker, Van Assche, Detraux","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.798554","20220131","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; major depressive disorder; mortality; schizophrenia; severe mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26292,""
"Risk of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress During the Second Wave of COVID-19 in Slovenia","The spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to numerous negative consequences on the mental health of the population throughout the world. The main aim of our study was to compare the risk for depression, anxiety, and stress during the second wave of the pandemic in Slovenia. An additional goal was to analyze the association of depression, anxiety, and stress, with the most relevant subjective factors that define the quality of life. Furthermore, we aimed at determining whether health workers have a higher risk for depression following the course of the pandemic. The study was conducted on the general population, between July 2020 and January 2021 through an online survey. The data of 1,728 respondents in two samples of respondents (782 at baseline - first measurement point and 946 during the second measurement point) of the second wave were analyzed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-test. The findings of this study show that the rise the second wave was associated with a higher risk for depression, anxiety and stress. The risk for all three was higher for younger participants.

"Associations Between Poor Sleep Quality, Anxiety Symptoms, and Depressive Symptoms Among Chinese Adolescents Before and During COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study","Since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, adolescents' emerging mental health and behavior issues have been an international public health concern. This longitudinal study aimed to examine the situation of poor sleep quality, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents and to explore the associations between them before and during COVID-19. A total of 1,952 middle and high school students as eligible participants at baseline (pre-COVID-19, Wave 1; response rate: 98.79%), 1,831 eligible students were followed up at Wave 2 (October 2019 to December 2019, pre-COVID-19; retention rate: 93.80%), and 1,790 completed the follow-up at Wave 3 (during the COVID-19; retention rate: 97.80%). The mean age of the baseline students was 13.56 (SD: 1.46) years. The differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms between Wave 1, Wave 2, and Wave 3 were not statistically significant. The proportion of students with poor sleep quality increased over time, from Wave 1 (21.0%) to Wave 3 (26.0%, OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.17-1.60, <i>P</i> = 0.001) and from Wave 2 (21.9%) to Wave 3 (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.11-1.51, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The cross-lagged generalized linear mixed models revealed that the concurrent and cross-lagged associations of poor sleep quality with anxiety symptoms across the three waves were significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and vice versa. Only a marginally significant positive cross-lagged association between poor sleep quality at Wave 2 and depressive symptoms at Wave 3 was found (standardized ÃŽÂ² estimate = 0.044, SE = 0.022, <i>P</i> = 0.045). Sleep quality was adversely affected during COVID-19, and the bidirectional associations of poor sleep quality with anxiety symptoms could not be neglected.","Wang, Guo, Du, Li, Wu, Guo, Lu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.786640","20220131","COVID-19; adolescent; longitudinal study; mental health; sleep problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26294,""
"Psychological Burden and Associated Factors of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People in Quarantine and Isolation Centers in Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> Globally, a lot of countries put into practice early quarantine measures as an essential COVID-19 prevention mechanism. Other than physical effects, quarantine has a major result on mental health and well-being at both the individual as well as the community level at large. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the psychological burden of COVID-19 on the people in quarantine and isolation centers and to identify associated factors for early and effective psychosocial intervention during the pandemic and beyond. <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional study was done among 392 suspected cases of COVID-19 that were in quarantine and isolation centers found in Eastern Ethiopia in 2020. Participants were selected by the convenience sampling method. The common mental disorder was measured by the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20). Logistic regression was done to identify predictive factors, and a <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <b>Results:</b> The common mental disorder among suspected cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia was found to be 13.5% (95% CI: 10.2, 17.1%). Female (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.92), known chronic medical illness (AOR = 7.0, 95% CI: 2.2, 21.8), inadequate accessibility of personal protective equipment (AOR = 6.1, 95% CI: 2.8, 13.3), poor awareness about the pandemic (AOR = 2.90, 95% CI: 2.71, 7.54), presence of symptoms of the disease (AOR = 5.3, 95% CI: 2.57, 11.1), and substance use (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 6.1) were found to be associated with a common mental disorder. <b>Conclusion:</b> The current study revealed that the common mental disorder was relatively high among suspected cases of COVID-19 in quarantine and isolation centers as compared with the general population. The results of the present study demonstrate that some subpopulations are more vulnerable to the pandemic's deleterious effects on mental health. Therefore, providing appropriate psychosocial intervention for the populations at risk is important to decrease the effect of common mental disorders among suspected cases of COVID-19.","Misgana, Tesfaye, Tariku, Ali, Alemu, Dessie","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.753383","20220131","COVID-19; Ethiopia; common mental disorder; isolation; quarantine; suspected cases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26295,""
"Vulnerability and Protective Factors for PTSD and Depression Symptoms Among Healthcare Workers During COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach","<b>Background:</b> Healthcare workers are at high risk for developing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to identify vulnerability and protective factors related to the severity of psychiatric symptoms among healthcare workers to implement targeted prevention and intervention programs to reduce the mental health burden worldwide during COVID-19. <b>Objective:</b> The present study aimed to apply a machine learning approach to predict depression and PTSD symptoms based on psychometric questions that assessed: (1) the level of stress due to being isolated from one's family; (2) professional recognition before and during the pandemic; and (3) altruistic acceptance of risk during the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 437 healthcare workers who experienced some level of isolation at the time of the pandemic participated in the study. Data were collected using a web survey conducted between June 12, 2020, and September 19, 2020. We trained two regression models to predict PTSD and depression symptoms. Pattern regression analyses consisted of a linear epsilon-insensitive support vector machine (ÃŽÂµ-SVM). Predicted and actual clinical scores were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), the coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>), and the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) to evaluate the model performance. A permutation test was applied to estimate significance levels. <b>Results:</b> Results were significant using two different cross-validation strategies to significantly decode both PTSD and depression symptoms. For all of the models, the stress due to social isolation and professional recognition were the variables with the greatest contributions to the predictive function. Interestingly, professional recognition had a negative predictive value, indicating an inverse relationship with PTSD and depression symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings emphasize the protective role of professional recognition and the vulnerability role of the level of stress due to social isolation in the severity of posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms. The insights gleaned from the current study will advance efforts in terms of intervention programs and public health messaging.","Portugal, Gama, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Mendlowicz, Erthal, Mocaiber, Tsirlis, Volchan, David, Pereira, de Oliveira","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.752870","20220131","COVID-19; PTSD; depression; healthcare worker (HCW); machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26296,""
"Non-Suicidal Self-Injury: A School-Based Peer Education Program for Adolescents During COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) constitutes a major health concern among youth. However, less is known about the useful ways to prevent NSSI. As such, the NSSI- Peer Education Program (NSSI-PEP) aims to intervene on the vulnerability factors that predispose to NSSI by applying a peer education approach. The NSSI-PEP is grounded on the psychoanalytic tradition's tenets, implementing modules targeting four crucial risk factors for NSSI: pubertal transformation, body image, self-esteem, and emotion regulation. <b>Methods:</b> Selected 8<sup>th</sup> grade students were trained to serve as peer educators and held a peer-education intervention for 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> grade students. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted in order to evaluate the program's effectiveness. <b>Results:</b> Results revealed preliminary support for the program's feasibility, as students reported greater emotion regulation abilities (<i>p</i> = 0.038) and significant changes in self-esteem (<i>p</i>&lt;<i>0.0</i>01), personal alienation (<i>p</i> = 0.005), body image (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and maturity fear (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Also, NSSI-PEP was positively evaluated by participants. <b>Discussion:</b> Our pilot study provides preliminary empirical support for the NSSI-PEP, representing a promising way to address areas of vulnerability for NSSI onset. Findings may also help current policies to promote targeted preventive activities and produce sizable benefits to society.","Cipriano, Aprea, Bellone, Cotrufo, Cella","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.737544","20220131","adolescence; non-suicidal self-injury; peer-education; prevention; puberty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26297,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Healthcare Providers: A Comparison of a Psychiatric Hospital and a General Hospital","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers (HCPs) were already experiencing a higher prevalence of mental health disorders compared with non-healthcare professionals. Here, we report on the psychosocial functioning and stress resilience of HCPs who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large-sized psychiatric facility and a large acute care hospital, both located in central Ontario, Canada. Participants completed five validated psychometric instruments assessing depression, anxiety, and stress (The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21, DASS-21); work-related quality of life (Work-Related Quality of Life Scale, WRQoL); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC); anxiety about the novel coronavirus (Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, CAS); and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale, ULS). Participants from the psychiatric hospital (<i>n</i> = 94) were sampled during the easing of restrictions after the first wave in Ontario, and participants from the acute care hospital (<i>n</i> = 146) were sampled during the height of the second wave in Ontario. Data showed that HCPs from the acute care hospital and psychiatric hospital reported similar scores on the psychometric scales. There were also no significant differences in psychometric scale scores between medical disciplines at the acute care hospital. Among all HCPs, being a nurse predicted better quality of life (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and greater stress resilience (<i>p</i> = 0.031). These results suggest that HCPs' psychological symptoms are similar across the hospital settings sampled. Compared to other HCPs, nurses may show a unique resiliency to the pandemic. We suggest that emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic have a pervasive effect on HCPs. It is important to address HCPs' mental health needs in terms of crisis management and improve resilience among all HCPs during the inter-crisis period before a new challenge arrives.","Anzola, Limoges, McLean, Kolla","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.720693","20220131","COVID-19; anxiety; healthcare provider; pandemic; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26298,""
"COVID-19 and Poverty in South America: the Mental Health Implications","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus made governments across the world announce country-wide lockdowns suspending all activities and banning travels. This affected the lives of millions of people across all the continents in the world, including South America. The low-income classes were most affected by the lockdowns as many lost their only source of income. In addition, the uncertainty of the disease and its deadly nature along with lack of access to correct information led to a deterioration of the mental health of the low-income and indigenous groups in South America. The low-income population has little chance of gaining access to proper mental healthcare as many healthcare systems collapsed due to the nature of the pandemic. A good number of them faced short-term mental effects such as anxiety and panic attacks as well as long-term effects of depression. Proper steps must be taken to maintain and help the most vulnerable sections of the population. The pandemic along with the widespread poverty-stricken regions in the country have affected the population of the country. This article assesses the impact of COVID-19 on the poor and low-income population of the South American continent and the impact it has had on their mental health.

"Network Analysis of Media Exposure and Psychological Outcomes During the Initial Outbreak of COVID-19 in China","During the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in China, people spent a lot of time viewing or listening to COVID-19-related media content. And according to the conservation of resources theory, COVID-19-related media exposure would be related to multiple psychological outcomes, and different contents would have different associations with different psychological outcomes. Therefore, the present study aimed to clarify these relationships and find out the most important psychological outcome correlated with COVID-19-related media exposure. An online survey was conducted to collect information about individuals' media use behaviors and mental health status. A total of 917 participants were included in further analyses. The results proved that different kinds of content had different relationships with different psychological outcomes. To be more specific, the content about people being heroic and speeches from experts and the authorities were related to increases of positive affect, while reports from hospitals were correlated with increases of death anxiety. Moreover, positive affect was central nodes of the network. The current findings indicated viewing objective and positive content was associated with positive psychological outcomes while viewing negative one was correlated with negative psychological outcomes. Furthermore, positive affect was the most important psychological outcome related to COVID-19-related media exposure.","Zhang, Liu, Liu, Chao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00738-1","20220131","COVID-19; Media content; Mental health; Network analysis; Positive affect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26300,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on US adolescents: loss of basic needs and engagement in health risk behaviors","Across the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic created myriad challenges for youth and families, including losses of basic needs which may be associated with increased use of maladaptive coping behaviors. In a sample of 2491Ã‚Â U.S. youth (ages 13-16), demographic differences in loss of basic needs and maladaptive coping were assessed using regression models. More than 21% of adolescents endorsed losing one or more basic needs (e.g., loss of access to food or shelter) and 83% endorsed use of maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., using drugs or alcohol; self-harming behaviors) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although adolescents with both majority and minority identities reported losing basic needs and engaging in maladaptive coping behaviors, minoritized youth reported more basic needs losses (<i>p</i>sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and greater reliance on maladaptive coping strategies (<i>p</i>sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) than their non-minoritized peers. Furthermore, adolescents who endorsed losing basic needs were more likely to also endorse engaging in maladaptive coping behaviors (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05).

"Economic hardships and self-reported deterioration of physical and mental health under the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study, 2020, Japan","COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the most vulnerable populations. We assessed the prevalence and disparities of economic hardships and their impact on health deterioration in Japan. Data were obtained from a nation-wide, cross-sectional, internet-based, self-reported survey conducted during Aug-Sep 2020 with individuals aged 15-79 years in Japan (n=25,482). Economic hardships and changes in various physical and mental health status were measured using sample-weighted data. Adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) were estimated to investigate the associations between economic hardships and health outcomes. During Apr-Sep 2020 in Japan, 25.0%, 9.6%, 7.9% and 3.1% of the respondents experienced income loss, money shortage, financial anxiety and financial exploitation, respectively, with higher prevalence among workers (vs. non-workers). Stratifying on sex and working status, income loss was associated with physical health deterioration (APRs ranged 1.45-1.95), mental health deterioration (APRs ranged 1.47-1.68), and having SPD (APRs ranged 1.41-2.01) across all strata. Shortage of money and financial anxiety were also associated with increased likelihood of all adverse health outcomes assessed, regardless of whether the hardships were pre-existing or experienced first time. Among non-working individuals, financial exploitation was associated with physical health deterioration among males (APR=1.88) and mental health deterioration among both males (APR=1.80) and females (APR=2.23), while such associations were not observed among working individuals. During the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, COVID-19-related economic hardships were associated with physical and mental health deterioration in Japan, particularly among the vulnerable populations.

"Prevalence of burnout syndrome among Work-From-Home IT professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Many countries adopted a complete or partial lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and various professions started to work-from-home. People who work-from-home experience constant stress which leads to burnout syndrome. Burnout can be defined as a chronic stress-induced occupational syndrome resulting in fatigue, decreased job productivity, and poor motivation towards the job. This research work primarily focuses on exploring the prevalence of burnout syndrome among IT professionals who work-from-home and to determine the impact of burnout in different gender and age-groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using snowball sampling method 934 IT professionals were selected based on selection criteria, explained about the study processes, and instructed to submit an online survey consist of Maslach Burnout Inventory scale (MBI) through mail, social media, or through a researcher by direct interview. Descriptive statistics were used to interpret the data. In 25-30 years age-group, men were affected (93%) less than women (94%) and also in 31-35 years age-group, men were affected (96%) less than women (98%). Overall burnout scores of men were 94% and women were 96%. Results indicate female IT professionals were more prone experience burnout syndrome than Male population. From the results, it is concluded that 95% of the IT professionals are suffering from burnout, where women are more prevalent to burnout when compared to male. It is also suggested that an early, routine and frequent assessment of physical status, mental status and burnout syndrome is essential to maintain mental health.","Kumaresan, Suganthirababu, Srinivasan, Chandhini, Divyalaxmi, Alagesan, Vishnuram, Ramana, Prathap","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-211040","20220131","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26303,""
"How does the working environment transition impact perceived work-related quality of life for postsecondary teachers within the United States?","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected societal norms and shifted much of the workforce in the United States to a virtual landscape. Working and learning from home (or ""remotely"") has become common in nearly every field, including higher level education. Each institution has implemented policies regarding remote work, and with the different policies educators are confronted with different conditions which affect their perceived level of stress and quality of working life. The objective of this study is to examine how the transition to working from home contributes to work-related stress and perceived quality of life among postsecondary educators during the first year of COVID-19 related institutional working policies. The study used a cross-sectional survey design. The survey was distributed online using email and social media to 1,575 postsecondary teachers in all four regions of the United States between February and March 2021. The survey collected demographic and institutional policy information related to remote work, in addition to the Work-Related Quality of Life Survey which gathers data on indicators of general well-being, job satisfaction, perceived control at work, perceived stress at work, working conditions, and work-life balance. Data was analyzed from 222 (14% response rate) respondents; 49% worked remotely full-time, 47% worked on a hybrid schedule (part-time remote, part-time on campus), and 4% were on campus full-time. The findings suggest that postsecondary teachers who worked in a hybrid program throughout 2020 felt they had more control at work and a higher overall quality of working life, while those who worked remote only or on-campus only felt more stress at work. The results also suggest that less time spent working from home contributes to higher stress and the perception of decreased control at work. Based on the survey results, remote working policies in higher education institutions have an impact on work-related quality of life and stress felt by their faculty. These findings can be used to guide the implementation of work-from-home or return-to-campus policies.","Horton, Jacobs","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210819","20220131","COVID-19; job satisfaction; occupational stress; post-secondary teachers; working environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26304,""

To investigate the opinions, emotions, skills, resources, critical issues and ethical aspects of palliative care encountered by hospice palliative care professionals in Italy. Content analysis was performed on the answers to a survey distributed by e-mail. A sample of 42 professionals completed the survey. They commonly experienced the pandemic as a challenging situation that highlighted the need for an upgrade to the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN). Conflicting emotions emerged, namely fear, frustration and sadness, but also hope and solidarity. The lack of adequate personal protective equipment and the fact that caregivers were unable to access their patients due to concerns of infection were the most critical problems. The need for greater training on communication skills and training on end-of-life issues were emphasised by the participants of the survey. Regarding ethical aspects of providing palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of guaranteeing humane care and patients' dignity was mentioned.

The logistic regression model was performed to assess factors correlated with couples' relationship quality during the lockdown. Furthermore, we performed pathway analyses to assess whether the changes in sexual behaviour, stress level, or psychological anxiety during the lockdown could predict the quality of couple relationship. A total of 940 patients with infertility were included in this study. When we conducted a stratified analysis of the participants, significant differences were found between the changes in their sexual behaviour, stress levels, and couple relationship quality. The logistic regression model showed that sex, anxiety symptoms, decreased sexual satisfaction, sexual activity frequency, and income levels were closely related to couple relationship quality. Pathway analyses indicated that changes in their sexual behaviour, anxiety symptoms, and stress levels could all predict the quality of couple relationship. The perceived changes in sexual behaviour with different stress levels and couple relationship quality showed significant differences. Analysing the related factors that affect the quality of couple relationship, especially in times of crisis, is of great significance as this information can contribute to the improvement of treatment for patients with infertility.","Dong, Tao, Wu, Kong, Zhou, Tan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-021-02361-4","20220130","Anxiety; COVID-19; Couple relationship; Infertility; Sexual behaviour; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26308,""
"No party, no drugs? Use of stimulants, dissociative drugs, and GHB/GBL during the early COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is presumably having an impact on the consumption of psychoactive substances. Social distancing and lockdown measures may particularly affect the use of ""party drugs"" (e.g., stimulants, dissociatives, and GHB/GBL) through the absence of typical use settings. We aimed to analyse the use patterns of those substances and underlying motivations before and during the pandemic. A subsample of 1,231 users of stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA/ecstasy, cocaine), dissociative drugs (ketamine, dextromethorphan, PCP), and GHB/GBL was assessed from 30th April to 4th August 2020 as part of the Corona Drug Survey, a cross-sectional international online survey in five languages that included a total of 5,049 participants. The reported use of distinct substances and the underlying motivations were ascertained before (retrospectively) and during the pandemic. Furthermore, associations between drug use as a coping mechanism, pandemic-related stressors, and substance use were examined. Regarding the reported frequency of use during the pandemic, 48.0-64.8% of the sample ceased or decreased, 11.9-25.5% maintained, and 23.6-29.1% increased their consumption. MDMA/ecstasy showed the strongest decrease and GHB/GBL and dissociatives the highest increase. Participants reported that price, quality, and supply were mostly unaffected by the pandemic. The most common motivations before and during the pandemic were mood-related factors, such as a desire to feel exhilarated, euphoric, high, or buzzed. The relevance of social purposes and mood-related motivators declined during the pandemic, whereas dealing with boredom increased. Overall, 16.4-35.6% perceived drug use as helpful for dealing with pandemic-related stressors, which were associated with an increased consumption frequency. The early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with major changes in the use of ""party drugs"". Those who increased their level of drug use and perceived it as a coping strategy in particular might be targeted with adaptive preventive and therapeutic measures.","Bendau, Viohl, Petzold, Helbig, Reiche, Marek, Romanello, Moon, Gross, Masah, Gutwinski, Mick, Montag, Evens, MajiÃ„â€¡, Betzler","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103582","20220130","Amphetamine; Cocaine; Corona; Ketamine; MDMA; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26309,""
"The Effects of Add-on Therapy of Phyllanthus Emblica (Amla) on Laboratory Confirmed COVID-19 Cases: A Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Trial","This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the effect of Phyllanthus Emblica (Amla) as an add-on therapy on COVID-19_ related biomarkers and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In this RCT, sixty-one patients were randomly assigned into two arms [the intervention (n=31) and control arms (n=30)]. The effect of Amla on diagnostic Reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test results between the first and the last days of the study, the length of stay (LOS) in hospital, the percentage of lung involvement on CT scans, changes in the clinical symptoms, and the laboratory markers were assessed. The two study groups had similar baseline demographics and characteristics in terms of medical history. The mean of LOS in the intervention arm (4.44 days) was significantly shorter than in the control arm (7.18 days, P&lt;0.001); RT-PCR results were not significantly different between the two arms (P=0.07). All clinical variables decreased over time in the two groups (P&lt;0.001). However, the difference between the two groups in terms of fever (P=0.004), severity of cough (P=0.001), shortness of breath (P=0.004), and myalgia (P=0.005) were significant, but this intergroup comparison was not significant with regard to respiratory rate (P=0.29), severity of chills (P=0.06), sore throat (P=0.22), and weakness (P=0.12). Out of the eight evaluated para-clinical variables, three variables showed significant improvement in the intervention arm, including the mean increase in oxygen saturation (SpO2) level (P&lt;0.001), the reduction in the mean percentage of lung involvement on CT (P&lt;0.001), and the improvement in C-reactive protein test results (P&lt;0.001). Organic herbal Amla tea cannot significantly affect the RT-PCR results and or degree of lung involvement. Nevertheless, it showed an ameliorative effect on the severity of clinical signs and CRP levels. Also, Amla tea may shorten the recovery times of symptoms and LOS in COVID-19 patients.","Varnasseri, Siahpoush, Nejad, Amini, Karamian, Yad, Cheraghian, Khosravi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2022.102808","20220130","COVID-19; Phyllanthus Emblica","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26310,""
"Generalized anxiety disorder during COVID-19 in Canada: Gender-specific association of COVID-19 misinformation exposure, precarious employment, and health behavior change","Growing evidence has demonstrated the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies have examined how pandemic-related stressors and resilience factors of anxiety affect women and men differently in Canada. Population-based data from the Canadian Perspective Survey Series (CPSS-4; JuneÃ‚Â 20Ã‚Â toÃ‚Â 26, 2020) were analyzed to examine the relationship between Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) with COVID-19 misinformation exposure, precarious employment, and health behavior changes, after adjusting for socio-demographic variables. Stratified by gender, two multinomial logistic regression were conducted to calculate the likelihood of having minimal/mild anxiety (1Ã¢â€°Â¤GAD score&lt;10) and moderate/severe anxiety (GAD score Ã¢â€°Â¥10), compared to no anxiety symptoms (GAD=0). Overall, respondents (n=3,779) were mainly Canadian-born (76.3%), aged &gt;25 years (85.4%) and high school graduate (87.9%). The population prevalence of moderate/severe GAD was 13.6%, with women significantly higher than men (17.2% vs. 9.9%). For women (n=2,016), GAD was associated with being absent from work due to COVID-19 reasons (OR=3.53, 99%CI:1.12-11.04), younger age (ORs range from 2.19 to 11.01, p's&lt;0.01), being single/widowed (OR=1.62, 99% CI 1.19-2.20), no past-week contacts outside household (OR=2.81, 99%CI:1.24-6.37), no outdoor exercise (OR=1.86, 99% CI:1.13-3.07). For men (n=1,753), GAD was associated with frequent fake news exposure (dose-response relations: ORs range from 3.14-6.55, p's&lt;0.01), increased time of watching TV (OR=2.62, 99% CI: 1.31 - 5.27), no indoor exercise (OR=1.91, 99% CI:1.07-3.42), reduced time of internet use (OR=5.47, 99%CI:1.27-23.63). For both genders, GAD was associated with increased intake of alcohol, cannabis, and junk/sweet food (p's&lt;0.01). Cross-sectional data prohibits causal inferences; self-reporting biases of GAD symptoms requires confirmation with diagnostic records.

"Enforced home-working under lockdown and its impact on employee wellbeing: a cross-sectional study","The Covid-19 pandemic precipitated a shift in the working practices of millions of people. Nearly half the British workforce (47%) reported to be working at home under lockdown in April 2020. This study investigated the impact of enforced home-working under lockdown on employee wellbeing via markers of stress, burnout, depressive symptoms, and sleep. Moderating effects of factors including age, gender, number of dependants, mental health status and work status were examined alongside work-related factors including work-life conflict and leadership quality. Cross-sectional data were collected over a 12-week period from May to August 2020 using an online survey. Job-related and wellbeing factors were measured using items from the COPSOQIII. Stress, burnout, somatic stress, cognitive stress, and sleep trouble were tested together using MANOVA and MANCOVA to identify mediating effects. T-tests and one-way ANOVA identified differences in overall stress. Regression trees identified groups with highest and lowest levels of stress and depressive symptoms. 81% of respondents were working at home either full or part-time (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°623, 62% female). Detrimental health impacts of home-working during lockdown were most acutely experienced by those with existing mental health conditions regardless of age, gender, or work status, and were exacerbated by working regular overtime. In those without mental health conditions, predictors of stress and depressive symptoms were being female, under 45Ã‚Â years, home-working part-time and two dependants, though men reported greater levels of work-life conflict. Place and pattern of work had a greater impact on women. Lower leadership quality was a significant predictor of stress and burnout for both men and women, and, for employees agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°45Ã‚Â years, had significant impact on level of depressive symptoms experienced. Experience of home-working under lockdown varies amongst groups. Knowledge of these differences provide employers with tools to better manage employee wellbeing during periods of crisis. While personal factors are not controllable, the quality of leadership provided to employees, and the 'place and pattern' of work, can be actively managed to positive effect. Innovative flexible working practices will help to build greater workforce resilience.","Platts, Breckon, Marshall","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12630-1","20220130","Home-working; Leadership; Mental health; Stress; Wellbeing; Work-life conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26312,""
"The experience of women with recent gestational diabetes during the COVID-19 lockdown: a qualitative study from Denmark","Following COVID-19 and the lockdowns, maternity care and support for women after delivery have been temporary restructured. Studies show that COVID-19 adversely impacts pregnant and peripartum women in the general population, but experiences among women in the first year after delivery/in the wider postpartum period remain unexplored. Moreover, experiences among women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are lacking; though it is a group with a potential high need for support after delivery. The aim of our study was to investigate (i) how women with recent GDM experienced COVID-19 and the first lockdown in Denmark, and (ii) the women's risk perception and health literacy in terms of interaction with the healthcare system in relation to COVID-19. We performed a qualitative study among 11 women with recent GDM (infants aged 2-11Ã¢â‚¬â€°months old). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in April-May 2020 by telephone or Skype for Business, when Denmark was under lockdown. We analysed data using a thematic qualitative content analysis. Three themes emerged: i) Everyday life and family well-being, ii) Worries about COVID-19 and iii) Health literacy: Health information and access to healthcare. The women were generally not worried about their own or their infant's risk of COVID-19. The lockdown had a negative impact on everyday life e.g. routines, loneliness, breastfeeding uncertainties and worries for the infant's social well-being; but better family dynamics were also described. It was challenging to maintain healthy behaviours and thus the women described worries for the risk of type 2 diabetes and GDM in subsequent pregnancies. The women missed peer support and face-to-face visits from health visitors and found it difficult to navigate the restructured care with online/telephone set-ups. COVID-19 and the lockdown affected everyday life among women with recent GDM both positively and negatively. Our findings suggest a need for care that are responsive to psychological and social aspects of health throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and support to limit worries about adaptation to motherhood and the infant's social well-being. Communication focusing on the importance and relevance of contacting healthcare providers should also be strengthened.","Jensen, Nielsen, Dahl-Petersen, Maindal","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04424-5","20220130","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Diabetes prevention; Gestational diabetes mellitus; Health care delivery; InfantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health; Lockdown; Mental health; Motherhood adaptation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26313,""
"Preventing COVID-19 outbreaks through surveillance testing in healthcare facilities: a modelling study","Surveillance testing within healthcare facilities provides an opportunity to prevent severe outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the quantitative impact of different available surveillance strategies and their potential to decrease the frequency of outbreaks are not well-understood. We establish an individual-based model representative of a mental health hospital yielding generalizable results. Attributes and features of this facility were derived from a prototypical hospital, which provides psychiatric, psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic treatment. We estimate the relative reduction of outbreak probability for three test strategies (entry test, once-weekly test and twice-weekly test) relative to a symptom-based baseline strategy. Based on our findings, we propose determinants of successful surveillance measures. Entry Testing reduced the outbreak probability by 26%, additionally testing once or twice weekly reduced the outbreak probability by 49% or 67% respectively. We found that fast diagnostic test results and adequate compliance of the clinic population are mandatory for conducting effective surveillance. The robustness of these results towards uncertainties is demonstrated via comprehensive sensitivity analyses. We conclude that active testing in mental health hospitals and similar facilities considerably reduces the number of COVID-19 outbreaks compared to symptom-based surveillance only.","Litwin, Timmer, Berger, Wahl-Kordon, MÃƒÂ¼ller, Kreutz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07075-1","20220130","Agent-based model; COVID-19; Infectious disease surveillance; Long-term care; Point-of-care testing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26314,""
"Association between relapses, stress, and depression in people with multiple sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic","Stress is a potential trigger for clinical and radiological activity in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). COVID-19 pandemic has been a relevant source of mental distress in people with MS (pwMS) and deeply impacted on disease management. To investigate the association between stress, anxiety, depression, and risk of relapse during the COVID-19 pandemic. From an electronic database used for clinical practice, we extracted data of relapsing-remitting (RR) or relapsing-progressive (RP) MS patients and calculated the annualized relapse rate (ARR) during 2019 and 2020. From 01/12/2020 to 30/12/2020, enrolled patients were invited to fill in a Google Forms survey to investigate depression, anxiety, stress, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). We selected 216 patients with RR or RP-MS to calculate ARR: compared to 2019, in 2020 there was a significant increase in ARR (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0142). Over 216 selected pwMS, 154 completed the survey. Matching the survey responses and incidence of relapses in 2020, there was a significant association between relapses and stress (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.030) and relapses and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011), but not between relapses and anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.130) or PTSD (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.279).

"COVID-19 and First Responder Social Workers: An Unexpected Mental Health Storm","COVID-19 has disproportionally affected people living in poverty; new immigrants; and those living in healthcare settings (hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes), shelters, detention centers, and prisons. The pandemic has also significantly impacted social workers who face hidden mental health consequences. The resultant feelings and behaviors are similar to disaster-induced trauma, including excessive rumination, hypervigilance, exhaustion, and excessive crying as a result of the adrenaline-driven fight-or-flight response. This article aims to provide information for social workers to protect their own mental health while caring for their clients and raise awareness about social workers' needs in frontline duties. It summarizes five challenges for first responder social workers: (1) COVID-19 impacts on resource constraints, (2) employment insecurity, (3) disenfranchised guilt, (4) physical distancing and caution fatigue, and (5) managing self-care. The article offers recommendations to ameliorate distress and promote advocacy efforts for readjustment. As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, social workers who provide essential care in the field need self-assessment to better understand the impacts these challenges have on them as helpers. The article ends with recommendations to encourage social workers to apply the strengths-based approach to exemplify their professional values in times of pandemic distress.","Davies, Cheung","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swac007","20220129","COVID-19 impact; caution fatigue; pandemic stress; symbolic care; unknown and hidden fear","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26316,""
"ANALYSIS OF MENTAL HEALTH IN PATIENTS, WHO HAVE HAD SARS COV-2 AT THE PRIMARY LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE","The aim of the study was to evaluate retrospectively the mental state of patients, who have had COVID - 19 at the primary level of health care according to medical documentation. Materials and methods: 70 outpatient charts of patients aged from 31 to 80 years who have had laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 and received primary health care, were processed. Conducted: assessment for the presence and determination of the severity of depression based on the scale of PHQ 9; screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Breslau et al., 1999). Results and conclusions: patients, who have had SARS CoV-2, the moderate severity of depressive syndrome prevailed. The risk of forming of PTSD is most presented in patients who have had severe SARS CoV-2, who had inpatient treatment and combined with low quality of life (QOL) at outpatient treatment as well. The increase of anxiety was found in individuals after outpatient and inpatient treatment, and it was accompanied with low QOL. Patients with complaints about cognitive impairment prevailed after inpatient treatment, and determined their QOL as low, especially in men in 100%. Sleep disturbances were detected in 90.3% of patients with complicated course of SARS CoV-2 during inpatient treatment with low QOL. Tachycardia was detected in 61.7% of patients in group 1 and in 52.2% in group 2, that could be a symptom of increased anxiety and PTSD, but it requires differential diagnosis with cardiac pathology.","Matviyets, Matiukha","https://www.google.com/search?q=ANALYSIS+OF+MENTAL+HEALTH+IN+PATIENTS,+WHO+HAVE+HAD+SARS+COV-2+AT+THE+PRIMARY+LEVEL+OF+HEALTH+CARE.","20220131"," SARS CoV-2;  depression ;  primary level of health care ;  quality of life ;  sleep disorder ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26317,""
"A systematic scoping review of the literacy literature to develop a digital food and nutrition literacy model for low-income adults to make healthy choices in the online food retail ecosystem to reduce obesity risk","Adults with lower incomes are disproportionately affected by poverty, food insecurity, obesity, and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In 2020-2021 amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) expanded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Online Purchasing Pilot program to enable eligible participants to purchase groceries online in 47 states. This expansion underscores the need for SNAP adults to have digital literacy skills to make healthy dietary choices online. Currently, a digital literacy model does not exist to help guide USDA nutrition assistance policies and programs, such as SNAP. We conducted a systematic scoping review of the academic and gray literature to identify food, nutrition, health, media, financial, and digital literacy models. The search yielded 40 literacy models and frameworks that we analyzed to develop a Multi-dimensional Digital Food and Nutrition Literacy (MDFNL) model with five literacy levels (i.e., functional, interactive, communicative, critical, and translational) and a cross-cutting digital literacy component. Utilization of the MDFNL model within nutrition assistance policies and programs may improve cognitive, behavioral, food security, and health outcomes and support equity, well-being, digital inclusion, and healthy communities to reduce obesity and NCD risks.","Consavage Stanley, Harrigan, Serrano, Kraak","https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13414","20220129","digital literacy; food and nutrition literacy; food environment; online food retail","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26318,""
"Use of Direct-to-Consumer Telemedicine to Access Mental Health Services","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has contributed to growing demand for mental health services, but patients face significant barriers to accessing care. Direct-to-consumer(DTC) telemedicine has been proposed as one way to increase access, yet little is known about its pre-pandemic use for mental healthcare. To characterize patients, providers, and their use of a large nationwide DTC telemedicine platform for mental healthcare. Retrospective cross-sectional study. Mental health encounters conducted on the American Well DTC telemedicine platform from 2016 to 2018. Patients and physicians. Patient measures included demographics, insurance report, and number of visits. Provider characteristics included specialty, region, and number of encounters. Encounter measures included wait time, visit length and timing, out-of-pocket payment, coupon use, prescription outcome, referral receipt, where care otherwise would have been sought, and patient satisfaction. Factors associated with five-star physician ratings and prescription receipt were assessed using logistic regression. We analyzed 19,270 mental health encounters between 6708 patients and 1045 providers. Visits were most frequently for anxiety (39.1%) or depression (32.5%), with high satisfaction (4.9/5) across conditions. Patients had a median 2.0 visits for psychiatry (IQR 1.0-3.0) and therapy (IQR 1.0-5.0), compared to 1.0 visit (IQR 1.0-1.0) for urgent care. High satisfaction was positively correlated with prescription receipt (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.54-2.32) and after-hours timing (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36). Prescription rates ranged from 79.6% for depression to 32.2% for substance use disorders. Prescription receipt was associated with increased visit frequency (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.57-2.42 for Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 visits). As the burden of psychiatric disease grows, DTC telemedicine offers one solution for extending access to mental healthcare. While most encounters were one-off, evidence of some continuity in psychiatry and therapy visits-as well as overall high patient satisfaction-suggests potential for broader DTC telemental health use.","Hohman, Martinez, Anand, Rood, Martyn, Rose, Rothberg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-07326-y","20220129","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26319,""
"Effects of Persistent Exposure to COVID-19 on Mental Health Outcomes Among Trainees: a Longitudinal Survey Study","The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created considerable strain on the physical and mental health of healthcare workers around the world. The effects have been acute for physician trainees-a unique group functioning simultaneously as learners and care providers with limited autonomy. To investigate the longitudinal effects of physician trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout using three surveys conducted during the early phase of the pandemic. Longitudinal survey study. All physician trainees (N = 1375) at an academic medical center. Assess the relationship between repeated exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 and stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. Three hundred eighty-nine trainees completed the baseline survey (28.3%). Of these, 191 and 136 completed the ensuing surveys. Mean stress, anxiety, and burnout decreased by 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): - 28 to - 12%; P &lt; 0.001), 25% (95% CI: - 36 to - 11%; P &lt; 0.001), and 13% (95% CI: - 18 to - 7%; P &lt; 0.001), respectively, per survey.

For depression, the association between exposure was strongest for the third survey, where mean depression scores increased by 33% per additional exposure (95% CI: + 18 to + 50%; P &lt; 0.001).

A data-driven approach was applied to a longitudinal, demographically diverse cohort of more than 3,000 young adolescents (10-14Ã‚Â years) participating in the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study in the United States, including multiple prepandemic visits and three assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic (May-August 2020). We fitted machine learning models and provided a comprehensive list of predictors of psychological distress in individuals. Positive affect, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were accurately detected with our classifiers. Female sex and prepandemic internalizing symptoms and sleep problems were strong predictors of psychological distress. Parent- and youth-reported pandemic-related psychosocial factors, including poorer quality and functioning of family relationships, more screen time, and witnessing discrimination in relation to the pandemic further predicted youth distress. However, better social support, regular physical activities, coping strategies, and healthy behaviors predicted better emotional well-being. Findings highlight the importance of social connectedness and healthy behaviors, such as sleep and physical activity, as buffering factors against the deleterious effects of the pandemic on adolescents' mental health. They also point to the need for greater attention toward coping strategies that help the most vulnerable adolescents, particularly girls and those with prepandemic psychological problems.","Kiss, Alzueta, Yuksel, Pohl, de Zambotti, MÃ…Â±ller-Oehring, Prouty, Durley, Pelham, McCabe, Gonzalez, Brown, Wade, Marshall, Sowell, Breslin, Lisdahl, Dick, Sheth, McCandliss, Guillaume, Van Rinsveld, Dowling, Tapert, Baker","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.11.023","20220129","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Mental-health; Pandemic; Sex differences; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26321,""
"How has the COVID-19 epidemic affected the risk behaviors of people who inject drugs in a city with high harm reduction service coverage in Vietnam? A qualitative investigation","The COVID-19 outbreak disproportionally affects vulnerable populations including people who inject drugs (PWID). Social distancing and stay-at-home orders might result in a lack of access to medical and social services, poorer mental health, and financial precariousness, and thus, increases in HIV and HCV risk behaviors. This article explores how the HIV/HCV risk behaviors of PWID in Haiphong, a city with high harm reduction service coverage in Vietnam, changed during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what shaped such changes, using the risk environment framework. We conducted three focus group discussions with peer outreach workers in May 2020 at the very end of the first lockdown, and 30 in-depth interviews with PWID between September and October 2020, after the second wave of infection in Vietnam. Discussions and interviews centered on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives, and how their drug use and sexual behaviors changed as a result of the pandemic. The national shutdown of nonessential businesses due to the COVID-19 epidemic caused substantial economic challenges to participants, who mostly were in a precarious financial situation before the start of the epidemic. Unsafe injection is no longer an issue among our sample of PWID in Haiphong thanks to a combination of different factors, including high awareness of injection-related HIV/HCV risk and the availability of methadone treatment. However, group methamphetamine use as a means to cope with the boredom and stress related to COVID-19 was common during the lockdown. Sharing of smoking equipment was a standard practice. Female sex workers, especially those who were active heroin users, suffered most from COVID-related financial pressure and may have engaged in unsafe sex. While unsafe drug injection might no longer be an issue, group methamphetamine use and unsafe sex were the two most worrisome HIV/HCV risk behaviors of PWID in Haiphong during the social distancing and lockdown periods. These elevated risks could continue beyond the enforced lockdown periods, given PWID in general, and PWID who are also sex workers in particular, have been disproportionately affected during the global crisis.","Nguyen, Hoang, Nguyen, Nguyen, Luong, Laureillard, Nagot, Des Jarlais, Duong, Nham, Khuat, Pham, Le, Michel, Rapoud, Le","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00586-1","20220131","COVID-19; Harm reduction; People who inject drugs; Risk behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","",26322,""
"The Infant Health Study - Promoting mental health and healthy weight through sensitive parenting to infants with cognitive, emotional, and regulatory vulnerabilities: protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial and a process evaluation within municipality settings","Child mental health problems are a major public health concern associated with poor mental and physical health later in development. The study evaluates a new community-based intervention to promote sensitive parenting and reduce enduring mental health problems and unhealthy weight among vulnerable infants aged 9-24 months. We use a step-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design conducted within a home visiting program offered by community health nurses to infant families in Denmark. Sixteen municipalities are randomly allocated to implement the intervention starting at three successive time points from May 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023. A total of 900-1000 families will be included. A standardized program, Psykisk Udvikling og Funktion (PUF), is used to identify infants with major problems of eating, sleep, emotional or behavioral regulation or developmental problems. The intervention builds on the Video-Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting (VIPP) program, adapted to the PUF-context and named the VIPP-PUF. Children will be followed up at ages 18 and 24 months. Primary outcome measure is the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at child age 24 months. The other outcome measures include body mass index z-scores, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE2); the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 1Ã‚Â½ -5); Eating behavior Questionnaires; the Being a Mother-questionnaire (BaM13); the Parental Stress Scale (PSS); and the WHO-5 well-being index (WHO-5). Data on child and family factors are obtained from National registries and the Child Health Database. Quantitative measures are applied to examine the effectiveness of the VIPP-PUF intervention and the implementation process. Qualitative measures include interviews with CHNs, parents and municipality stakeholders to explore factors that may influence the adherence and effectiveness of the intervention. The study examines a service-setting based intervention building on the promotion of sensitive parenting to vulnerable infants. We use a mixed methods approach to evaluate the intervention, taking into account the influences of COVID-19 pandemic running since March 2020. Overall, the study has potential to add to the knowledge on the possibilities of prevention within the municipality child health care to reduce the risk of mental health problems and unhealthy weight in early childhood. www.ClinicalTrials.gov ; ID NCT04601779 ; Protocol ID 95-110-21307.
