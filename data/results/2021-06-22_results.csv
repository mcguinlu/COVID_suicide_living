"Dysregulation of brain and choroid plexus cell types in severe COVID-19","Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, patients and survivors can suffer neurological symptoms<sup>1-3</sup>. Yet, an unbiased understanding of the cellular and molecular processes affected in the brains of COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 30 frontal cortex and choroid plexus samples across 14 control (including 1 terminal influenza) and 8 COVID-19 patients. While a systematic analysis yields no molecular traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, we observe broad cellular perturbations which predict that choroid plexus barrier cells sense and relay peripheral inflammation into the brain and show that peripheral T cells infiltrate the parenchyma. We discover COVID-19 disease-associated microglia and astrocyte subpopulations that share features with pathological cell states reported in human neurodegenerative disease<sup>4-6</sup>. Synaptic signaling of upper-layer excitatory neurons-evolutionarily expanded in humans<sup>7</sup> and linked to cognitive function<sup>8</sup>-are preferentially affected in COVID-19. Across cell types, COVID-19 perturbations overlap with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognition, schizophrenia, and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework to understand COVID-19 related neurological disease observed now and which may emerge later.","Yang, Kern, Losada, Agam, Maat, Schmartz, Fehlmann, Stein, Schaum, Lee, Calcuttawala, Vest, Berdnik, Lu, Hahn, Gate, McNerney, Channappa, Cobos, Ludwig, Schulz-Schaeffer, Keller, Wyss-Coray","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03710-0","20210621","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15166,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in an intensive care unit (ICU): Psychiatric symptoms in healthcare professionals - A systematic review","During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the structure of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) activities changed fast. It was observed that the mental and physical health of the frontline workers reached levels of extreme clinical and psychological concern. Understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on the front-line clinical team in the ICU environment, as well as reveal what proposals are being made to mitigate the clinical and psychological impacts that this group experiences. A systematic review was made following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). We included any type of study on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with results about their mental health. We were, therefore, interested in quantitative studies examining the prevalence of problems and effects of interventions, as well as qualitative studies examining experiences. We had no restrictions related to study design, methodological quality or language. Twenty-one studies reported on the urgent need for interventions to prevent or reduce mental health problems caused by COVID-19 among health professionals in ICU. Eleven studies demonstrated possibilities for interventions involving organizational adjustments in the ICU, particularly linked to emotional conflicts in the fight against COVID-19. The disproportion between the need for technological supplies of intensive care medicine and their scarcity promotes, among many factors, high rates of psychological distress. Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fear and anguish were observed during the pandemic, probably related to extremely high workloads and the lack of personal protective equipment.","Troglio da Silva, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.044","20210621","COVID-19; Clinical and psychological aspects; Experiences and perceptions from health professionals in ICU; Health workers in ICU; Intensive care unit (ICU)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15167,""
"Using a daily diary approach to examine the early effects of COVID-19 on daily physical activity bouts and contexts among residents of Colorado and California","COVID-19 restrictions may prevent adults from achieving sufficient physical activity (PA) and may affect PA context. This study examined the early effects of COVID-19 on daily PA bouts and contexts during April-June 2020 using a daily diary approach. Adults (N = 390) completed daily diary surveys for 28 days assessing number of PA bouts and social (e.g., alone), locational (i.e., home, neighborhood, recreational space), and technology (e.g., using streaming videos) contexts of PA. Mixed-effects models examined the effects of days since the pandemic started (on 3/13/2020), state residence, and demographics on number of daily PA bouts. Models examined demographic and temporal effects on PA context. Participants were 18-77 years, 15% Hispanic/Latino, and 80% female. PA bouts per day decreased significantly over time among Californians versus Coloradans (bsimple = -0.01, p &lt; .001) and Hispanics/Latinos (vs. non-Hispanic Latinos) did fewer PA bouts per day (b = -0.17, p = .04). Most PA bouts occurred while alone (56.7%), at home (43.4%), or in any neighborhood (40.5%). Older (60+ years) versus younger (&lt;40 years) adults were less likely to do PA with others (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.90). PA bouts in recreational spaces were more common on weekends versus weekdays (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.32-1.92) and were less common among California versus Colorado residents (OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12-0.42). PA bouts decreased from April to June 2020, and these changes disparately affected subgroups. Resources are needed to counteract the negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions intended to slow disease spread on PA. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in closure of spaces for engaging in physical activity, including gyms, parks, and recreation centers. Closure of these spaces likely had a negative impact on activity. We used daily, phone-based surveys to study the effects of COVID-19 on the number of activity bouts individuals did each day, and the context of activity, between April and June 2020. Our study included 390 adults living in California or Colorado who were 18Ã¢â‚¬â€œ77 years old, 80% female, and 15% Hispanic/Latino. Californians significantly decreased the number of daily bouts over time, but Coloradans showed no change in daily bouts. Hispanic/Latinos did fewer daily bouts than non-Hispanic/Latinos. Most bouts occurred when people were alone (56.7%), at home (43.4%), or in a neighborhood (40.5%). Adults 60+ years were more likely to do activity alone than with others. Bouts in recreational spaces were more common on weekends versus weekdays, and Californians were less likely to do bouts in recreational spaces than Coloradans. Additional resources are needed to counteract the negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions that intended to slow disease on activity levels, particularly in places with greater restrictions for accessing physical activity spaces.","Courtney, Nuss, Wang, Do, Dunton","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab066","20210621","COVID-19; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Physical activity; Social environment; Time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15168,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand for emergency ambulances in Victoria, Australia","<b><i>Objective</i>:</b> Relatively little has been reported about the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on emergency ambulance services. We describe the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the emergency ambulance system in Victoria, Australia.<b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> We performed an interrupted time series analysis of consecutive calls for ambulance from January 2018 to February 2021, including two waves of COVID-19. The COVID-19 lockdown period included seven months of stay-at-home restrictions (16/03/2020-18/10/2020). Nineteen weeks of post-lockdown data were included (19/10/2020-28/02/2021).<b> <i>Results:</i> </b> In total, 2,356,326 consecutive calls were included. COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an absolute reduction of 64,991 calls (almost 2,100 calls/week). According to time series analysis, lockdown was associated with a 12.6% reduction in weekly calls (IRR =0.874 [95% CI 0.811, 0.941]), however no change in long-term trend (IRR =1.000 [95% CI 0.996, 1.003]). During lockdown, the long-term trend of attendances to patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS, IRR =1.006 [95% CI 1.004, 1.009]) and mental health-related issues (IRR =1.005 [95% CI 1.002, 1.008]) increased. After lockdown, the call volume was 5.6% below pre-COVID-19 predictions (IRR =0.944 [95% CI 0.909, 0.980]), however attendances for suspected ACS were higher than predicted (IRR =1.069 [95% CI 1.009, 1.132]). Ambulance response times deteriorated, and total case times were longer than prior to the pandemic, driven predominantly by extended hospital transfer times.<b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> The COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on the emergency ambulance system. Despite lower call volumes post-lockdown than predicted, we observed deteriorating ambulance response times, extended case times and hospital delays. The pattern of attendance to patients with suspected ACS potentially highlights the collateral burden of delaying treatment for urgent conditions.","Andrew, Nehme, Stephenson, Walker, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2021.1944409","20210621","COVID-19; ambulance; demand; emergency medical service; utilisation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15169,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Individuals With and Without Mental Health Disorders","To identify people with history of mental health disorders before the COVID-19 pandemic in the Brazilian population and estimate the prevalence of mood swings and the subjective distress of the pandemic among individuals with or without mental health disorders. Through an online survey, participants were asked about presence or absence of mental health disorders. In addition, they answered the Brunel Mood Scale and the Impact of Event Scale. The mean percentile of mood swing indicators and psychological impact scores were estimated, and data were analyzed by logistic regression. 13,248 people participated (70.5% women, mean age 35.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 31.2% with history of mental health disorder). Women and younger people were more likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorder. All participants had significant changes in mood due to the pandemic. Anger, depressed mood, mental confusion, and fatigue were higher among individuals with bipolar disorder or with combined disorders. Individuals with mental health disorders had a greater subjective distress, especially the group with bipolar disorder (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.89 [3.64-6.56]) and combined disorders (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.89 [5.21-9.10]).

"Behaviour is the Key in a Pandemic: The Direct and Indirect Effects of COVID-19-Related Variables on Psychological Wellbeing","The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of three COVID-19-related variables (i.e., risk perception, knowledge, and behaviour) on four indices of pandemic-related mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, loneliness, and hopelessness). In total, 337 participants completed four self-report questionnaires: selected subscales of the World Health Organisation's COVID-19 Behavioural Insights Tool, UCLA Loneliness Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Beck Hopelessness Scale. In addition to descriptive statistics and intercorrelations, structural equation modelling was used to compare three models of the potential role (predictor or moderator/mediator) that the three abovementioned COVID-19-related variables could play in psychological wellbeing. The results showed high levels of psychological distress among the current sample. Generally, better knowledge of COVID-19 and engaging in protective behaviours were found to be related to lower levels of psychological distress, whereas increased risk perception was found to be associated with increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. It was also found that behaviour mediated the effect of knowledge on psychological wellbeing, suggesting that while publicising information about COVID-19 remains necessary, providing the public with a means to engage in protective behaviours is central for promoting psychological wellbeing.","Padmanabhanunni, Pretorius","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211025269","20210621","Anxiety; COVID-19; South Africa; behaviour; depression; hopelessness; loneliness; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15171,""
"Occupational and Personal Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on US Oncologist Burnout and Well-Being: A Study From the ASCO Clinician Well-Being Task Force","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global crisis profoundly affecting oncology care delivery. This study will describe the occupational and personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncologist well-being and patient care. Four virtual focus groups were conducted with US ASCO member oncologists (September-November 2020). Inquiry and subsequent discussions centered on self-reported accounts of professional and personal COVID-19 experiences affecting well-being, and oncologist recommendations for well-being interventions that the cancer organization and professional societies (ASCO) might implement were explored. Qualitative interviews were analyzed using Framework Analysis. Twenty-five oncologists were interviewed: median age 44 years (range: 35-69 years), 52% female, 52% racial or ethnic minority, 76% medical oncologists, 64% married, and an average of 51.5 patients seen per week (range: 20-120). Five thematic consequences emerged: (1) impact of pre-COVID-19 burnout, (2) occupational or professional limitations and adaptations, (3) personal implications, (4) concern for the future of cancer care and the workforce, and (5) recommendations for physician well-being interventions. Underlying oncologist burnout exacerbated stressors associated with disruptions in care, education, research, financial practice health, and telemedicine. Many feared delays in cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Oncologists noted personal and familial stressors related to COVID-19 exposure fears and loss of social support. Many participants strongly considered working part-time or taking early retirement. Yet, opportunities arose to facilitate personal growth and rise above pandemic adversity, fostering greater resilience. Recommendations for organizational well-being interventions included psychologic or peer support resources, flexible time-off, and ASCO and state oncology societies involvement to develop care guidelines, well-being resources, and mental health advocacy. Our study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected oncologist burnout, fulfillment, practice health, cancer care, and workforce. It illuminates where professional organizations could play a significant role in oncologist well-being.","Hlubocky, Back, Shanafelt, Gallagher, Burke, Kamal, Paice, Page, Spence, McGinnis, McFarland, Srivastava","https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.21.00147","20210621","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15172,""
"Taking Care of Those Who Care: Attending Psychological Needs of Health Workers in a Hospital in Madrid (Spain) During the COVID-19 Pandemic","We aim to review evidence of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare professionals and the effects of the psychological crisis interventions and measures implemented to manage stress. Mental health problems are frequently encountered in health professionals during emergencies and often prevail over the following years. Results show health professionals exhibited symptoms of depression, anxiety, emotional distress, burnout, post-traumatic stress and poor sleep quality. In response to acute responses to stress, it is crucial to provide psychoeducation, mindfulness and coping resources. These interventions can improve resilience and self-efficacy of professionals, as well as help to prevent anxiety, depression and quality of sleep. The need for intervention programmes targeting the mental health of vulnerable populations has been widely acknowledged. We described a psychological support plan designed and implemented with the aim of providing mental health care for health professionals.

"Lived Experiences of Family Members of Patients With Severe COVID-19 Who Died in Intensive Care Units in France","During the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, family members were often separated from their loved ones admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), with a potential for negative experiences and psychological burden. To better understand the experiences of bereaved family members of patients who died in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic, from the time of hospital admission until after the patient's death. This qualitative study used semistructured, in-depth interviews to collect experiences from bereaved family members of patients who died from severe COVID-19 in 12 ICUs during the first wave of the pandemic in France. Purposeful sampling was used to ensure the diversity of study participants with respect to sex, age, relationship with the patient, and geographic location. All data were collected between June and September 2020, and data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. Interviews were conducted 3 to 4 months after the patient's death and were audio-recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Among 19 family members interviewed (median [range] age, 46 [23-75] years; 14 [74%] women), 3 major themes emerged from qualitative analysis. The first was the difficulty in building a relationship with the ICU clinicians and dealing with the experience of solitude: family members experienced difficulties in establishing rapport and bonding with the ICU team as well as understanding the medical information. Distance communication was not sufficient, and participants felt it increased the feeling of solitude. The second involved the patient in the ICU and the risks of separation: because of restricted access to the ICU, family members experienced discontinuity and interruptions in the relationship with their loved one, which were associated with feelings of powerlessness, abandonment, and unreality. The third was regarding disruptions in end-of-life rituals: family members described &quot;stolen moments&quot; after the patient's death, generating strong feelings of disbelief that may lead to complicated grief. This qualitative study found that during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, bereaved family members described a disturbed experience, both during the ICU stay and after the patient's death. Specific family-centered crisis guidelines are needed to improve experiences for patients, families, and clinicians experiences.","Kentish-Barnes, Cohen-Solal, Morin, Souppart, Pochard, Azoulay","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.13355","20210621","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15174,""
"COVID-19 Related Anxiety in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer at Tertiary Hospitals in the Cape Town, South Africa","The health profile of older adults places them at risk of infirmity and death from COVID-19 which may induce anxiety or exacerbate pre-existing anxiety. We examined COVID-19 related anxiety in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer (CaP). This study was conducted between July and September 2020. Sixty participants from a larger prospective, longitudinal study assessing depression, anxiety and health related quality of life in men with localized prostate cancer (DAHCaP) were included. COVID-19 related anxiety was measured at a single time point using, the Corona Virus Anxiety Scale (CAS). In addition, the following, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), the Connor-Davidson Resilience (CD-RISC) scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) that form part of the DAHCaP study were used in the analysis. We extracted pre-pandemic data for the STAI-S. Twenty-one percent had diabetes, 62.3% had hypertension and 24.6% had cardiac diseases, all known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Only 3% scored Ã¢â€°Â¥9 on the CAS, indicating COVID 19 anxiety dysfunction. Half knew of family or friends that had contracted COVID-19 especially those scoring higher on the CAS (<i>P</i> = 0.042).

"Profile of patients attending psychiatric emergency care during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic: a comparative cross-sectional study between lockdown and post-lockdown periods in Lombardy, Italy","To assess the long-term impact of early COVID-19 lockdown phase on emergency psychiatric consultations in two psychiatric emergency departments located in Italy. We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the number and characteristics of emergency psychiatric consultations during post-lockdown with respect to the lockdown period. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, referred symptoms, diagnosis, information on multiple psychiatric consultations and hospitalisation were collected. A rise of almost 60% in emergency psychiatric consultations during the post-lockdown compared to the lockdown period was observed. Emergency psychiatric consultations in the post-lockdown period were associated with lower rates of cannabis (aOR = 0.42, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011) and cocaine use (aOR = 0.39, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011).

"Examining the Effects of Social Determinants of Health on COVID-19 Related Stress, Family's Stress and Discord, and Personal Diagnosis of COVID-19","COVID-19 is a significant threat to people's mental health and social well-being. The research examined the effects of social determinants of health on COVID-19 related stress, family's stress and discord, and personal diagnosis of COVID-19. In November 2020, the data collection was conducted from 97 counties in North Carolina (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1500). Adult residents in North Carolina completed an online COVID-19 impact survey conducted using quota-based sampling on race, income, and county to provide a rapid quasi-representative assessment of COVID impact. The study investigated the variables in a structural model through structural equation modeling. For data analysis, IBM SPSS and AMOS were deployed. Social determinants of health had direct effects on COVID-19 related stress (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.66, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, <i>r</i>2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.43), family's stress and discord (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.73, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, <i>r</i>2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.53), and personal diagnosis of COVID-19 (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.52, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, <i>r</i>2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.27). These findings indicate that underserved populations experienced higher stress and discord at both individual and family levels and more severe COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, black participants, whose family income and food access declined significantly more, had worse stress, discord, and COVID-19 symptoms than white participants. The study suggests that the government and health professionals enhance mental health and family support service accessibility for underprivileged populations through telehealth and community health programs to prevent associated social and health issues such as suicide, violence, and cancer.","Lee, Paul, Pilkington, Mulrooney, Diggs, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100183","20210621","COVID-19; Discord; Health disparities; Race; Social Determinants of Health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15177,""
"Psychosocial Health Effects Of Covid-19 Infection On Persons In Treatment Centers In Lagos, Nigeria","Prior research has highlighted the psychosocial impact of infectious diseases on individuals and the community at large. However, little is known about the psychosocial implications of COVID-19. This study set out to determine the rate as well as correlates of anxiety and depressive symptoms among persons managed as in-patients for COVID-19 in Lagos, Nigeria. We conducted an online survey between April to June ending 2020 using a consecutive sampling technique of persons positive for COVID-19 and who were managed as in-patients across five (5) treatment centers in Lagos, Nigeria. The survey collected information on demographic as well as clinical data including suicidality. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). There were one hundred and sixty participants in total. The mean age of respondents was 36.4 (Ã‚Â±9.7) years with a higher proportion (56.9%) being males. With regards to diagnosis, 28.1% and 27.5% of the respondents were categorised as probable cases of depression and anxiety respectively, while 3.8% respondents reported suicidal ideation. Majority of the respondents (61.9%) reported the fear of infecting their loved ones. The variables that showed association with psychiatric morbidity were a past history of an emotional concern, employment status, guilt about infecting others and boredom. This study revealed a high burden of psychological/psychiatric morbidity among persons treated for COVID-19, particularly persons who have had prior emotional concerns. The findings from this study reiterate the need to pay attention to the mental health of people during disease outbreaks and to incorporate psychosocial interventions as part of the management package.","Fadipe, Oshodi, Umeh, Aikomo, Ajirotutu, Kajero, Fashanu, Adeoye, Coker, Sokunbi, Nyamali, Ajomale, Gbadebo, Oni, Keshinro, Ngozi Ejiegbu, Bowale, Akase, Mutiu, Adebayo, Abdus-Salam, Bode, Osibogun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100284","20210621","Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; In-patients; Nigeria; Psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15178,""
"Development of An Individualized Risk Prediction Model for COVID-19 Using Electronic Health Record Data","Developing an accurate and interpretable model to predict an individual's risk for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a critical step to efficiently triage testing and other scarce preventative resources. To aid in this effort, we have developed an interpretable risk calculator that utilized de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (UAB-i2b2) COVID-19 repository under the U-BRITE framework. The generated risk scores are analogous to commonly used credit scores where higher scores indicate higher risks for COVID-19 infection. By design, these risk scores can easily be calculated in spreadsheets or even with pen and paper. To predict risk, we implemented a Credit Scorecard modeling approach on longitudinal EHR data from 7,262 patients enrolled in the UAB Health System who were evaluated and/or tested for COVID-19 between January and June 2020. In this cohort, 912 patients were positive for COVID-19. Our workflow considered the timing of symptoms and medical conditions and tested the effects by applying different variable selection techniques such as LASSO and Elastic-Net. Within the two weeks before a COVID-19 diagnosis, the most predictive features were respiratory symptoms such as cough, abnormalities of breathing, pain in the throat and chest as well as other chronic conditions including nicotine dependence and major depressive disorder. When extending the timeframe to include all medical conditions across all time, our models also uncovered several chronic conditions impacting the respiratory, cardiovascular, central nervous and urinary organ systems. The whole pipeline of data processing, risk modeling and web-based risk calculator can be applied to any EHR data following the OMOP common data format. The results can be employed to generate questionnaires to estimate COVID-19 risk for screening in building entries or to optimize hospital resources.","Mamidi, Tran-Nguyen, Melvin, Worthey","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2021.675882","20210621","COVID-19; ICD-10; credit scorecard model; electronic health record; risk prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15179,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown stress consequences in people with and without Irritable Bowel Syndrome","While all resources have been mobilized to fight COVID-19, this study aimed to analyze the consequences of lockdown and pandemic stress in participants with and without Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). An online survey was proposed to people with or without IBS during the exponential phase of the pandemic in France. The questionnaire included questions about socio-demographic data, conditions of confinement, activities carried out, IBS characteristics, measurement of stress level, consequences on sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression, and quality of life (both perceived non-specific and specific for IBS). From March 31 to April 15, 2020, 304 participants, 232 with IBS and 72 without were included in the survey (mean age: 46.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 16.8 years, female gender: 75.3%). Age, level of education, financial resources, living space per person and activities performed during confinement were identical in both groups. Stress linked to fear of COVID-19, lockdown and financial worries was at the same level in both groups, but the psychological consequences and deterioration of quality of life (QOL) were both higher in IBS participants. In a univariate analysis, teleworking, solitary confinement, and low household resources had a variable impact on the scores of depression, anxiety, fatigue and non-specific perceived QOL, but in a multivariate analysis, the only factor explaining a deterioration of non-specific QOL was the fact of suffering from IBS. Stress linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and confinement is high and equivalent in both IBS and non-IBS participants, with higher psychological and QOL consequences in IBS patients who have altered coping capacities.","Sabate, Deutsch, Melchior, Entremont, Mion, Bouchoucha, FaÃƒÂ§on, Raynaud, Zerbib, JouÃƒÂ«t","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2021.100660","20210621","COVID-19; Irritable bowel syndrome; Pandemic; Quality of life; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15180,""
"Perceived Stress During the COVID-19-Related Confinement in Cyprus","The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global health emergency that could potentially have a significant impact on both somatic as well as psychological level. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of perceived stress in the general adult population of Cyprus during the first COVID-19 lockdown period. This was an internet-based cross-sectional study conducted between 6 April and 20 June 2020, one to two and a half months after the introduction of and the first mandatory lockdown on its entire territory imposed by the government of the Republic of Cyprus on 24 March 2020. Data collection was done using a self-administered questionnaire that included information about socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, physical activity, smoking habits, and stress level. A total of 1,485 adults participated in the study. The median perceived stress score was 10 (q1 = 6, q3 = 15). Linear regression models showed that having a medium monthly income (Ã¢â€šÂ¬501-1,500) and being a current smoker was positively associated with the perceived stress score, while being male and physically active was negatively associated with the perceived stress score (all <i>p</i> &lt;0.05). People with medium average salary and current smokers were at a higher risk for perceived stress.

"The Role of Self-Efficacy and Injunctive Norms in Helping Older Adults Decide to Stay Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Purpose:</b> Because older adults are at elevated risk of COVID-19-related adverse health outcomes, and staying at home is an effective strategy to avoid unnecessary exposures, the current formative study used the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) to identify the beliefs underlying older adults' decision to stay home for the next month. <b>Methods:</b> The participants (weighted <i>n</i> = 206, age 65-94) for the current study were selected from a nationally representative online survey of US adults from April 10-20, 2020. We used multiple linear regression to estimate the relative contribution of the four RAA global constructs (instrumental attitude, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy) in explaining intention to stay home after controlling for demographic covariates. We also conducted a content analysis to identify beliefs about advantages, disadvantages, and facilitators of staying home. <b>Results:</b> After controlling for demographic characteristics, injunctive norms (<i>b</i> = 0.208; SE = 0.059; <i>B</i> = 0.213, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and self-efficacy (<i>b</i> = 0.532; SE = 0.058; <i>B</i> = 0.537, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) showed statistically significant independent associations with intention to stay home. The specific beliefs underlying the decision to stay home spanned across health and wellness dimensions and suggested interpersonal, mental health, and leisure/recreational facilitators. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest three public health intervention targets. First, self-efficacy building interventions could enhance older adults' perceptions of their ability to stay home to avoid unnecessary exposures. Second, health communication messages to address injunctive norms could emphasize that people important to older adults think they should stay home. Third, for the youngest of the older adults, health communication messages could emphasize the advantages of staying home.","Macy, Owens, Mullis, Middlestadt","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.660813","20210621","COVID-19; belief determinants; older people; reasoned action approach; self-efficacy; stay at home orders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15182,""
"Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sweden","In this cross-sectional study we aimed to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore factors predictive of these mental health outcomes. A sample of 1,503 participants, recruited from the general Swedish population, completed an online survey distributed through social media. In this sample, 22.2% reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10) and 10.9% indicated possible major depression using the PHQ-9 algorithm. Moreover, 28.3% reported clinically significant levels of anxiety (GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 8) and 9.7% severe anxiety and possible GAD (GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 15). Multiple linear regression analyses identified some common predictors for both outcomes. Age, having a stable income, and sufficient social stimulation, sleep, and recovery showed negative associations, whereas worry about the economy and overall burden showed positive associations.

"Smoking, distress and COVID-19 in England: Cross-sectional population surveys from 2016 to 2020","Changes in the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic in England may exacerbate existing health inequalities. This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years. Cross-sectional data came from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2,927) between April-July in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month distress across 2016/2017 and 2020, and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristics in 2016/2017 and 2020. Between the combined April-July 2016 and 2017 sample and April-July 2020 the prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers increased (2016/2017: moderate 20.66%, 19.02-22.43; severe 8.23%, 7.16-9.47; 2020: moderate 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60; ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25; severe 11.04%, 9.30-13.12; ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.16, 1.13-4.07). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16-24Ã‚Â years) and middle-age groups (45-54Ã‚Â years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate distress and older age groups (65+ years) increases in severe distress. There were increases of moderate distress among more disadvantaged social grades and both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction. Between April-July 2016/2017 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress among smokers differed between 2016/2017 and 2020 and represents a widening of inequalities.","Kock, Brown, Shahab, Moore, Horton, Brose","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101420","20210621","COVID-19; Mental health; Smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15184,""

"The Impact of Intolerance of Uncertainty on Test Anxiety: Student Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Test anxiety caused by intolerance of uncertainty has a negative impact on the physical and mental health of student athletes, especially in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 556 grade three high school student athletes in Chongqing, China, were investigated using the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), Perceived Social Support Scale, and Coping Style Scale for Middle School Students. Results reveal that more than half the student athletes experienced test anxiety, and the severity was above average during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant correlation between intolerance of uncertainty, perceived social support, coping style, and test anxiety. A positive correlation was found between test anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and coping style toward emotions, and a negative correlation between test anxiety, perceived social support, and coping style toward problems. Intolerance of uncertainty has a direct predictive effect on test anxiety, and perceived social support and coping style play a chain mediator role between intolerance of uncertainty and test anxiety. By constructing the mediating effect model, we can, to some extent, reveal the mechanism of the influence of intolerance of uncertainty on test anxiety. This study has a certain reference value for the prevention of test anxiety in student athletes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Zhou, Yang, Li, Deng, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.658106","20210621","COVID-19 pandemic; intolerance of uncertainty; mediating effect; student athletes; test anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15186,""
"Unrealistic Optimism and Risk for COVID-19 Disease","Risk perception and consequently engagement in behaviors to avoid illness often do not match actual risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality. Unrealistic optimism occurs when individuals falsely believe that their personal outcomes will be more favorable than others' in the same risk category. Natural selection could favor overconfidence if its benefits, such as psychological resilience, outweigh its costs. However, just because optimism biases may have offered fitness advantages in our evolutionary past does not mean that they are always optimal. The current project examined relationships among personal risk for severe COVID-19, risk perceptions, and preventative behaviors. We predicted that those with higher risk of severe COVID-19 would exhibit unrealistic optimism and behave in ways inconsistent with their elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical risk scores for severe COVID-19 were calculated and compared with COVID-19 threat appraisal, compliance with shelter-in-place orders (March 13-May 22, 2020) and travel restrictions, compliance with public health recommendations, and potential covariates like self-rated knowledge about COVID-19 in a robust dataset including 492 participants from McLennan County, TX, USA. While those with high clinical risk acknowledged their greater likelihood of experiencing severe illness if infected, they actually reported lower perceived likelihood of becoming infected in the first place. While it is possible that those with higher clinical risk scores truly are less likely to become infected, the pattern and significance of these results held after controlling for possible occupational exposure, household size, and other factors related to infection probability. Higher clinical risk also predicted more recent travel within Texas and lower distress during the pandemic (i.e., feeling less stressed, depressed, and helpless). Additional behavioral data suggested that those with higher clinical risk scores did not generally behave differently than those with lower scores during the shelter-in-place order. While unrealistic optimism may provide some short-term psychological benefits, it could be dangerous due to improper assessment of hazardous situations; inferring that optimism bias has evolutionary origins does not mean that unrealistic optimism is &quot;optimal&quot; in every situation. This may be especially true when individuals face novel sources (or scales) of risk, such as a global pandemic.","Gassen, Nowak, Henderson, Weaver, Baker, Muehlenbein","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647461","20210621","COVID-19; SARSÃ¢â‚¬â€œCoVÃ¢Ë†â€™2; optimism bias; pre-existing condition; risk perception; unrealistic optimism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15187,""
"&quot;It's Not the Same&quot;: A Comparison of the Psychological Needs Satisfied by Musical Group Activities in Face to Face and Virtual Modes","According to the social identity approach to health, group memberships influence people's mental health to the extent that they identify with their group. Emerging evidence suggests that music groups, such as choirs, enhance mental health <i>via</i> group identification and the satisfaction of various psychological needs; however, more research is required to understand these processes in other types of music groups. Furthermore, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing restrictions in 2020 prevented music groups from meeting face to face (F2F). Some music groups adapted virtually, but the rate of adaptation of various music activities is unknown, as is the impact of such adaptations on participants' group identification, psychological need satisfaction, and mental health. We explored these questions using a cross-sectional survey with 257 participants (<i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> = 46 years, 78% female) of singing (<i>n</i> = 172), instrumental (<i>n</i> = 48), and dance groups (<i>n</i> = 37). Participants rated group identification and psychological needs satisfaction retrospectively for their music group in F2F mode and then for the group in adapted mode, along with mental health 12-item short form health survey (SF-12). Results showed that instrumental groups (60%) were less commonly adapted to virtual mode than singing (83%) and dance (86%) groups. Group identification and average psychological needs satisfaction (<i>M</i> = 4.04 and 3.50 out of 5) scores were significantly lower for groups in virtual mode than in F2F mode (<i>M</i> = 4.53 and 4.14, respectively). Psychological needs satisfaction did not mediate the relationship between group identification and SF-12 mental health. Despite this, values on group identification and psychological need satisfaction remained high, which suggests that virtual music groups may be beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic and in contexts where F2F groups are less accessible.","Draper, Dingle","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.646292","20210621","dance; group singing; instrumental groups; psychological need satisfaction; social identity approach; virtual","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15188,""
"Effects of Physical Activity and Training Routine on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Curfew","This research aimed to explore the effects of physical activity and training routine on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and the proclaimed emergency state and curfew. To measure the mental health components of psychological distress and subjective well-being, two studies were conducted on different samples: Study 1 during the beginning of curfew in Serbia (<i>N</i> = 678) and Study 2 during the ending phase (<i>N</i> = 398). The results of Study 1 showed that elite athletes as well as those with high level of physical activity experienced the lowest distress. Furthermore, effects of the changes in the training routine on distress among physically active individuals depended on the level of sports participation with elite athletes who reduced trainings showing lower anxiety compared to recreational athletes who reduced trainings as well or kept the same training routine. Thus, we could conclude that in the early stage of the pandemic, elite athletes showed better mental health and adaptability to the crisis situation. Results of Study 2 showed that although all the participants had decreased well-being during the curfew, compared to the period before the pandemic and the curfew, there were no differences in well-being between elite and recreational athletes, who had higher well-being compared to non-athletes. However, this effect held both before and during the curfew showing that physically active individuals did not additionally benefit from this decrease compared to the non-active. Furthermore, athletes who became physically inactive showed lower well-being compared to those who kept the same training routine. Thus, in the later stage of the pandemic, prolonged physical inactivity had negative effects on mental health.","SokiÃ„â€¡, Popov, DiniÃ„â€¡, RastoviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624035","20210621","COVID-19; athletes; coronavirus; distress; mental health; training routine; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15189,""
"Exploring the Psychological Effects of COVID-19 Home Confinement in China: A Psycho-Linguistic Analysis on Weibo Data Pool","With the rapid spread of COVID-19, strict home confinement has been implemented in most parts of Chinese regions. Millions of people were not allowed to leave their homes except for special reasons. Home confinement plays an essential role in curbing pandemic and promoting preventive behaviors, but it may affect individuals' mental health as well. The objective of this study was to explore the psychological impacts of home confinement. We collected more than 150,360 Weibo messages from 5,370 Chinese active users, and then extracted psycho-linguistic features from these messages. Psycho-linguistic analysis was carried out using the 2 (confinement vs. non-confinement) Ãƒâ€” 2 (before vs. after confinement) repeated measure analysis of variance (RM ANOVA). The results showed that the frequency of positive emotion words was remarkably decreased during home confinement [<i>F</i><sub>(1,5368)</sub> = 7.926, <i>p</i> = 0.005, ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> = 0.001].

Home confinement caused a decline in the use of positive emotion words. This indicates that home confinement can increase the frequency of negative emotions. The changes of exclusion words and inhibition words in high-endemic areas may be related to the high epidemic threat and the urgent need for social distancing in these areas.","Wu, Zhao, Li, Liu, Wang, Liu, Liu, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.587308","20210621","COVID-19; LIWC; activity restriction; home confinement; mental health; psycho-linguistic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15190,""
"Perfectionism and Eating Behavior in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a massive global health crisis leading to different reactions in people. Those reactions may be adaptive or not depending on situational or psychological processes. Disordered eating attitudes and behaviors are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic through multiple pathways as suggested by Rodgers et al. (2020). Among the psychological variables that may have increased dysfunctional eating attitudes and behaviors as a consequence of the social distancing and isolation, we looked at perfectionism. Perfectionism is a well-recognized risk and maintaining factor of eating-related symptoms and interact with stress increasing the probability of dysfunctional reactions (e.g., Wang and Li, 2017). The present study investigated the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism and eating behaviors by considering the mediating role of psychological distress. Data were collected from two countries (Italy and Spain) by means of an online survey. The samples included 465 (63.4% female) participants from Italy and 352 (68.5% female) from Spain. Participants completed the short form of the Hewitt and Flett Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Lombardo et al., 2021) to assess self-oriented, other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as the short form of Three Factors Eating Questionnaire (Karlsson et al., 2000) and the Italian version of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (Bottesi et al., 2015), respectively used to assess restrictive, emotional and uncontrolled eating on one hand, and depression, anxiety and stress on the other. Multigroup analysis was performed to test the hypothesized model. Results showed that other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were indirectly related to most of the dysfunctional eating aspects through the mediation of psychological distress, and the pattern obtained was consistent in both countries. These findings evidence that the psychological distress potentially related to the COVID-19 disease mediates the negative impact of interpersonal perfectionism and the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions.","Vacca, De Maria, Mallia, Lombardo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.580943","20210621","COVID-19; eating behavior; mediation; multidimensional; perfectionism; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15191,""
"Interventions to Optimise Mental Health Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review","Adverse mental health has been a major consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review examines interventions to enhance mental health outcomes and well-being of populations during COVID-19. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL) were searched following Arskey and O'Malley's six-staged scoping review process. Twenty studies were included in the review. Various study populations were included to ensure greater generalisability of results. Interventions informing treatment of mental health concerns during COVID-19 were included and classified into (a) prevention of poor mental health, (b) therapeutic interventions, and (c) other interventions.

"Immediate impacts of COVID-19 on female and male farmers in central Myanmar: Phone-based household survey evidence","This article provides evidence of the immediate impacts of the first months of the COVID-19 crisis on farming communities in central Myanmar using baseline data from January 2020 and follow-up phone survey data from June 2020 with 1,072 women and men. Heterogeneous effects among households are observed. Fifty-one percent of the sample households experienced income loss from various livelihood activities, and landless households were more severely affected by the crisis, mainly because of lost farm and nonfarm employment and negative impacts on rural enterprises. Women and men in these landless households were equally engaged and affected by lower wages or more difficulties in finding farm work; fewer women were engaged in nonfarm work, but almost all of them lost such nonfarm wage employment. Women in landless households are also particularly vulnerable in terms of worsened workload and increased tension in the household during COVID-19. Landed households were also affected through lower prices, lower demand for crops, and difficulties in input access. Women and men differ in levels of stress, fear, and pessimism regarding the effects of COVID-19. In most households, there were no signs that household task-sharing and work balance improved, and no clear shift in intrahousehold relations was observed.","Ragasa, Lambrecht, Mahrt, Aung, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12632","20210621","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19 impacts; gender; phone survey; rural livelihoods; women's empowerment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15193,""
"Beyond the four walls: The evolution of school psychological services during the COVID-19 outbreak","The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in early 2020 led to the sudden temporary closure of K-12 schools across the United States. Schools were tasked with providing remote instruction to students, and many of these children continued to require mental and behavioral health services provided by school psychologists. In this study, 675 school psychologists were surveyed across the United States to examine how their roles and responsibilities changed as a result of COVID-19. Participants reported the perceived impact of COVID-19 on students' mental health and difficulty serving students and families, as well as their concerns and recommendations pertaining to school reentry. Overall, respondents in this study reported that their roles and responsibilities notably changed because of COVID-19. Participants noted their belief that children and educators will need increased mental health support upon returning to school. Implications for future practice and research are discussed.","Schaffer, Power, Fisk, Trolian","https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22543","20210621","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; mental health; pandemic; remote learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15194,""
"COVID-19 among young adults in Sweden: self-reported long-term symptoms and associated factors","The main aim of the study was to describe self-reported symptoms of COVID-19 and examine if long-term symptoms are associated with lifestyle factors or common chronic diseases among Swedish young adults. A secondary aim was to compare the prevalence of smoking and snuff use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study population includes 1644 participants aged 23-26 years from the Swedish population-based birth cohort BAMSE. From August to November 2020, the participants answered a web questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms, lifestyle and health. Information on tobacco use was compared against the previous study follow-up in 2016-2019. The prevalence of suspected COVID-19 symptoms was 45.3% (<i>n</i>=742), and 80 of these (10.8%) reported long-term symptoms (Ã¢Â©Â¾4 weeks). There was no significant difference in sociodemographic or lifestyle factors in relation to the duration of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Rhinitis, migraine and lower self-rated health before the pandemic was more common among participants with long-term symptoms. In addition, there was a tendency for higher prevalences of asthma, chronic bronchitis and depression in this group. The prevalence of smoking decreased from 18.9% before the pandemic to 14.7% during the pandemic, while snuff use increased from 12.7% to 22.4% (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Almost half of Swedish young adults have had symptoms of suspected COVID-19 from February up to August 2020. Among these, one out of 10 have had long-term symptoms for at least 4 weeks. Long-term symptoms of suspected COVID-19 were associated with several common chronic conditions. Smoking may have decreased during the pandemic, while snuff use may have increased.","EkstrÃƒÂ¶m, Andersson, LÃƒÂ¶vquist, Lauber, Georgelis, Kull, MelÃƒÂ©n, BergstrÃƒÂ¶m","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211025425","20210621","COVID-19; Sweden; smokeless tobacco; smoking; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15195,""

"Internet addiction among medical and non-medical students during COVID-19 pandemic, Tanta University, Egypt","Internet addiction is one of the most growing addictive behaviors worldwide, especially among university students affecting their physical and mental health negatively. During COVID-19, accessing online books, completing assignments, and online assessments are highly recommended by universities, teachers, and students. The Internet has increasingly become a vital part of our lives, and distant online classes increase the dependency of students on the Internet. The aim of this study is to assess the level of internet addiction among medical or non-medical students in Tanta University, Egypt. This was a cross-sectional study conducted during October and November 2020. It included 373 students from the faculty of medicine and 373 non-medical students from the faculty of science. The validated (IAT-20) was used to assess the level of Internet addiction among these students. A total of 51.7% of medical students were found severe internet addicts and 43.4% of them were possible addicts compared to only 11.3% of non-medical students who were found severely addicted to the Internet and 68.9% of them were possible addicts with statistically significant difference between them. Female students of both colleges were found addicted to the Internet than males. Female medical and non-medical students suffered from severe Internet addiction more than non-medical and male ones. Appropriate awareness creation intervention strategies should be implemented to decrease the level of Internet addiction among university students and to reduce its harmful and negative consequences.","Shehata, Abdeldaim","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14961-9","20210620","Addiction; COVID-19; Internet; Students; Tanta, Egypt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15197,""

"Mental and Sexual Health of Polish Women of Reproductive Age During the COVID-19 Pandemic - An Online Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic can cause emotional distress, which can in turn lead to the development of mental and physical symptoms. We examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak and the mental, physical and sexual health of the female Polish population. Data were collected in an online survey distributed on social media from April 22, 2020 through to May 7, 2020. The data collection began one month after the start of lockdown in Poland. Women were asked to complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaires. Overall, 1644 women (median age 23 years) took part in the survey. They reported a lower frequency of sexual activity (P &lt; .001) and a lower libido level (P &lt; .001) during the pandemic then before it. 57.5% of the study group (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯944) strongly agreed or agreed that fear of the health condition of loved ones was a source of stress and depressed mood. The average BDI-II total score was 11 (range 0-51; IQR 5-18), which corresponds to minimal depression. The average FSFI total score was 27.01 Ã‚Â± 7.61 (range 2-36). The FSFI and BDI scores were significantly correlated (P &lt; .001). The FSFI score was significantly correlated with the presence of any comorbid chronic disease, the intensity of the fear of infection and fear of health conditions, perceived loneliness, and the being up to date with media news. The BDI score was significantly correlated with age, the intensity of the fear of infection and fear of health conditions, perceived loneliness, being up to date with media news, and the more frequent use of stimulants. The COVID-19 lockdown setting was associated with a high occurrence of depressive symptoms and increased risk of sexual dysfunction with decreased libido and lower sexual frequency the most commonly reported issues.

"Gambling and the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review","The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is tremendous. Since the beginning of the pandemic, several actors have raised concerns about the impact of the pandemic on gambling. Many actors fear a switch to online gambling in the context of the closure of many land-based gambling activities due to the restrictions imposed by public health authorities, such as physical distancing and lockdowns. This switch is worrisome because online gambling is considered a high-risk game. In that context, we need to know more about the impacts of the pandemic on gambling. This scoping review aims to summarize the literature that addresses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling. To our knowledge, this is the first review to focus on this subject. An electronic literature search involving a strategy using keywords related to COVID-19 and gambling was conducted using MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Social Works Abstract, and Socio Index databases on February 25th 2021. This search was combined with a manual search in Google Scholar. To be included, studies had to discuss gambling and COVID-19 as a primary theme, be written in English, and be published in a peer-reviewed journal. After collecting the information, we collated, summarized, and reported the results using narrative synthesis. The search identified 181 articles. After the removal of duplicates and screening, 24 full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study: 14 original articles, 8 commentaries or editorials, and 2 protocols. Contrary to expectations, preliminary evidence suggested that gambling behavior often either decreased or stayed the same for most gamblers during the pandemic. However, for the minority who showed increased gambling behavior, there was frequently an association with problem gambling. The available literature on COVID-19 and gambling is limited and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling behavior and gambling problems is still unclear. Therefore, there is a need for more research on this topic, both qualitative and mixed methods studies, to better understand the impact of the pandemic on gambling. Considering the results, we need to be careful, particularly with problem gamblers and other subgroups of the population who seem to be more vulnerable to increased gambling habits during this pandemic period.","Brodeur, Audette-Chapdelaine, Savard, Kairouz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110389","20210619","Addiction; COVID-19; Gambling; Pandemic; Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15200,""
"Does COVID-19 pandemic disrupt sustainable supply chain process? Covering some new global facts","The adverse effects of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are widely visible in the economic structure, while the principal causal factor is the disruption of the supply chain process that leads to the economies into a global depression. The purpose of the study is to identify the critical factors that affect the global sustainable supply chain process in the cross-sectional panel of 38 European countries, 14 North American countries, 40 Asian countries, and a heterogeneous panel of 111 countries. The results show that an increase in susceptible coronavirus cases and death tolls limits the supply chain process because of nationwide closures of industries and business activities. In contrast, an increase in the number of recovered cases supports economic activities and improved logistic performance index across countries. The innovation accounting matrix shows that since August 2020, the global coronavirus cases will decline and start resuming economic activities to increase the supply chain process. The result is further supported by the estimates of reduction in the proportion of death to recovered cases (case fatality ratio 1) to increase sustainable logistics activities. However, the supply chain process could affect an increasing death toll and case fatality ratio 2 (i.e., the proportion of death to registered cases) over time. The global economies should ensure a free flow of sustainable logistics supply, especially the supply of healthcare medical equipment that would help control the coronavirus pandemic, which escapes from the nations from a global depression.","Anser, Khan, Nassani, Abro, Zaman, Kabbani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14817-2","20210619","COVID-19; Case fatality ratios; Innovation accounting matrix; Regression analysis; Sustainable supply chain process","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15201,""

"COVID-19 in healthy children: What is the effect of household contact?","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is milder compared with adults. It is considered that household virus exposure may affect clinical severity. We aimed to determine the household contact history of patients and its influence on the clinical stage. One hundred seventy-three pediatric patients with COVID-19 as diagnosed with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 aged one month to 18 years were included. Demographic data, laboratory and clinical findings, and the history of household contact (with or without) of the patients were obtained. They were classified according to their clinical stage as mild or moderate-severe. Sixty patients (34.7%) were asymptomatic, and 113 were symptomatic (65.3%). Of the 173 patients, 138 (79.8%) had at least one family member in the household who was diagnosed as having COVID-19. Hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and ANC/absolute lymphocyte count ratio decreased significantly in patients with household contact. The presence of a household contact had not significant effect on the presence of symptoms, clinical course, age, and the sex of the patients. The need for hospitalization was less in the group that had household contact. Being 0-12 months and female sex, and the patients without household contact were independent factors associated with higher hospitalization ratios in logistic regression analysis. In this study, we found that household contact history did not significantly affect presenting symptoms and clinical course.

"COVID-19-related personal product shortages are associated with psychological distress in people living with gastrointestinal disorders: A cross-sectional survey","The mental health response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic-related product shortages in those living with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders has received little attention. We aimed to explore the association between the pandemic-related product shortages and psychological distress in people with GI disorders. This online cross-sectional survey was nested within an ongoing, international, prospective study of well-being in people with GI disorders. The study was advertised in multiple countries in May-September 2020 via patient organizations and social media. The primary outcome measure was distress, evaluated by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. We utilized linear regressions, adjusting for covariates and testing individual moderation effects. Overall, 831 people completed the survey from 27 countries, of whom 82% were female (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 49Ã‚Â years). The most common disorders included inflammatory bowel disease (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 322), celiac disease (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 273), and irritable bowel syndrome (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 260). Significant problems accessing food were reported by 19.8%, non-medical therapies by 16%, toilet paper by 10.8%, and essential medication by 8.9% of the sample (&gt;5% pain medication). There was a positive association between toilet paper and pain medication shortages and distress, and a negative association between food shortages and distress. Significant moderation effects were identified for COVID-19 prevalence and toilet paper and food shortages, and between COVID-19 fear and pain medication shortages. The study documented a significant relationship between product shortages and psychological distress, which were associated with COVID-19 prevalence and fear.

"Coping strategies mediate the associations between COVID-19 experiences and mental health outcomes in pregnancy","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in elevated mental health problems for pregnant women. Effective coping strategies likely reduce the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. This study aimed to (1) understand how COVID-19 stressors are related to different coping strategies and (2) identify whether coping strategies act as mechanisms accounting for the associations between COVID-19 stressful experiences and mental health problems in pregnancy. Participants were 304 pregnant women from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and perceived stress were assessed using validated measures. COVID-related stressors (i.e., financial difficulties, social isolation), subjective negative impact of COVID-19, and coping strategies used in response to COVID-19 were assessed by questionnaires. Results indicated that the subjective negative impact of COVID-19 was associated with more dysfunctional coping and less emotion-focused coping, whereas specific COVID-19 stressors, namely financial difficulties and social isolation, were associated with more dysfunctional coping and problem-focused coping. Dysfunctional coping was linked to elevated mental health problems and emotion-focused coping was linked to less mental health problems. Dysfunctional coping and emotion-focused coping partially mediated the effects of specific COVID-19 stressors on mental health outcomes. Findings indicate that coping is one pathway through which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts mental health in pregnancy. Supports and interventions for pregnant women during the pandemic should focus on bolstering coping skills, in order to minimize the mental health consequences of COVID-19.","Khoury, Atkinson, Bennett, Jack, Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-021-01135-2","20210619","COVID-19; Coping; Coronavirus; Mental health; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15206,""
"Discontinuation of Continuation or Maintenance Electroconvulsive Therapy Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Naturalistic Study Investigating Relapse in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder","Continuation or maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (C/M-ECT) is recommended to reduce relapse rates of patients with major depressive disorder. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have come under pressure or needed to close because of redirected resources and safety reasons. We investigated the impact of C/M-ECT discontinuation on relapse in patients with unipolar depressive disorder in Flanders, Belgium. Between March 30 and June 18, 2020, all patients receiving C/M-ECT in 2 ECT centers were included. Continuation or maintenance electroconvulsive therapy was discontinued in 33 patients and continued in 4 patients. Relapse was defined as the need to restart ECT or the need for hospitalization. Depressive symptoms were assessed every 3 weeks using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and 2 additional patient-rated questions. Relapse in the discontinuation group was 60.6%. All 4 patients who continued ECT remained remitted. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly shorter relapse rates for patients receiving bitemporal and/or frequent C/M-ECT (1- to 2-week intervals). Patients older than 60 years showed longer survival rates. Our results confirm earlier prospective and retrospective data regarding the efficacy and importance of C/M-ECT as relapse prevention. After treatment discontinuation, close monitoring of early warning signs for relapse is crucial, especially in the first few months. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing, our data provide an indication of the necessity to ensure adequate care and access to ECT not only for the acutely ill but also for the vulnerable patients who are depending on C/M-ECT.","Van de Velde, Geerts, Tandt, Vanderhasselt, Titeca, Lemmens","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCT.0000000000000785","20210619","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15207,""

"Caring for the carers: a COVID-19 psychological support programme","The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent pandemic brought unprecedented worldwide challenges born out of a rapidly escalating health and economic crisis. From emergency planners to healthcare workers on the front line, and everyone in between, the pandemic, and the uncertainty surrounding it, was likely to become a significant stressor, one with no immediate solution but with the potential to cause enduring distress beyond its conclusion. The UK Defence Medical Services recognised the need to provide an evidence-based programme of care intended to support personnel transitioning from assisting the national response back to normal duties. This was informed by a narrative review that targeted literature exploring strategies for supporting the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers during 21st-century infectious disease outbreaks. The literature identified the experiences most likely to cause enduring distress, which comprised morally challenging decisions, vulnerability, death and suffering, professional and personal challenges, and expectations. The opportunity to find meaning in these experiences, by discussing them with peers who share a contextual understanding, is important to limit the longer-term psychosocial impact of such events. This paper will discuss the design considerations and planned implementation strategy of the Recovery, Readjustment and Reintegration Programme to limit the incidence of distress or longer-term mental ill health among military personnel.","Lamb, Simms, Greenberg, Withnall","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-001854","20210619","COVID-19; mental health; organisational development; trauma management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15209,""
"Nurses' Emotional Stress Levels When Caring for COVID-19 Patients in an Intensive Care Unit","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an effect on many communities' physical and mental well-being, especially that of healthcare workers. During the pandemic, health workers have shown signs of depression and anxiety and have experienced sleep disturbances. Few studies have examined health workers' resilience during the pandemic. The current study intended to examine the job stress and mental well-being of nurses who have supported, worked with, and cared for COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit. The research team performed a narrative review by searching the Mendeley, ScienceDirect, Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Springer databases. The search used many keywords, both alone and in combination, such as COVID-19, pandemic, nurses, healthcare professionals, stress, and frontline workers. The review considered only English journals. This study was take place in Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Province, China. During the current pandemic, COVID-19 prevention in social settings, governmental regulation during the pandemic, and provision of frontline care have faced notable challenges. In general, nurses who have assisted during the COVID-19 pandemic have been under severe strain. The key factors that influenced nurses' stress were being only children, their working time per week, and their levels of anxiety. COVID-19 has posed a vast threat to public health worldwide. The psychological stress of nurses should be managed in public-health emergencies.","Lin, Zheng","https://www.google.com/search?q=Nurses'+Emotional+Stress+Levels+When+Caring+for+COVID-19+Patients+in+an+Intensive+Care+Unit.","20210618","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15210,""
"Community resilience and psychological distress in Chinese older adults amid COVID-19: the roles of perceived community prevention effectiveness and risk perception","<b>Objectives:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world, bringing a disaster for not only public physical but also mental health. As older adults are more vulnerable than those in other age groups in this disaster, their psychological distress in this pandemic is of particular concern. Considering the importance of communities in combating the pandemic, we examined the role of a community in relieving older adults' psychological distress and the heterogeneous effect by older adults' different levels of risk perception.<b>Method:</b> We collected data through a questionnaire survey of 272 older adults in 12 communities in the Sichuan province of China in April 2020, and used the structural equation model to analyze the data.<b>Results:</b> we found that community resilience was negatively associated with older adults' psychological distress (depression, anxiety, stress), and this association was mediated by perceived community prevention effectiveness. However, this indirect effect was stronger for older adults with low risk perceptions than for ones with high risk perceptions (including self-risk perception and group-risk perception).<b>Conclusion:</b> These findings underlined a community's vital significance in alleviating older adults' psychological distress amid the COVID-19 pandemic and moreover indicated that tailored interventions for facilitating community pandemic prevention should be designed for older adults with different risk perceptions.","Zhang, Wang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1935458","20210618","community resilience; older adults; perceived community prevention effectiveness; psychological distress; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15211,""
"Changes in mental health during the COVID-19 crisis in Romania: A repeated cross-section study based on the measurement of subjective perceptions and experiences","The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused dramatic changes in the daily lives of Romanians, affecting their mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved at three significant peaks, which sequentially occurred on: April 29, 2020; September 18, 2020; and the third wave registered the highest severity on November 27, 2020. Little is known about the mental health changes during this phase of this pandemic. This study evaluated mental health levels in Romania at the end of the first wave of the pandemic and amidst the third and most severe wave. We administered a two-phase internet-based survey among 543 and 583 participants, respectively, recruited through snowball sampling at a 6-month interval. The IPAT Anxiety Scale measured anxiety, the Beck's Depression Inventory measured depression, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale measured dissociation. We observed no statistically significant differences in the number of participants with clinically relevant scores at either time point. In the first survey, 23.8%, 19.2%, and 32.6% reported being clinically anxious, clinically depressed, and showed clinical dissociation, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated that age, education level, and previous traumatic events were significantly associated with clinical levels of anxiety and depression. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis reported a collective significant effect of gender, age, psychological impact, traumatic events, and dissociation on predicting high levels of anxiety and depression.

"The effect of mandala colouringÃ‚Â on anxiety in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial","COVID-19 significantly affects patients' mental health, triggering a wide range of psychological disorders, including anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mandala colouring on the anxiety of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were randomly divided between the intervention and control groups. Standard care was provided for both groups. The intervention group spent 30Ã‚Â min/day for six consecutive days performing mandala colouring. Patient anxiety was measured prior and subsequent to the intervention in both groups using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Data were analysed using SPSS software version 25. The mean anxiety score was not significantly different between the two groups before the intervention (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.08). Subsequent to the intervention, the mean anxiety score in the intervention and control groups was 44.05Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4.67 and 67.85Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.25, respectively, indicating a statistically significant (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0001) decrease in the anxiety measured among the intervention group as compared with that of the control group. The results of this study show that 30Ã‚Â min of mandala colouring daily is an effective strategy for reducing anxiety in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

"Indications of Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: Comparison of National Survey and Twitter Data","The current COVID-19 pandemic is associated with extensive individual and societal challenges, including challenges to both physical and mental health. To date, the development of mental health problems such as depressive symptoms accompanying population-based federal distancing measures is largely unknown, and opportunities for rapid, effective, and valid monitoring are currently a relevant matter of investigation. In this study, we aim to investigate, first, the temporal progression of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and, second, the consistency of the results from tweets and survey-based self-reports of depressive symptoms within the same time period. Based on a cross-sectional population survey of 9011 German adolescents and adults (n=4659, 51.7% female; age groups from 15 to 50 years and older) and a sample of 88,900 tweets (n=74,587, 83.9% female; age groups from 10 to 50 years and older), we investigated five depressive symptoms (eg, depressed mood and energy loss) using items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) before, during, and after relaxation of the first German social contact ban from January to July 2020. On average, feelings of worthlessness were the least frequently reported symptom (survey: n=1011, 13.9%; Twitter: n=5103, 5.7%) and fatigue or loss of energy was the most frequently reported depressive symptom (survey: n=4472, 51.6%; Twitter: n=31,005, 34.9%) among both the survey and Twitter respondents. Young adult women and people living in federal districts with high COVID-19 infection rates were at an increased risk for depressive symptoms. The comparison of the survey and Twitter data before and after the first contact ban showed that German adolescents and adults had a significant decrease in feelings of fatigue and energy loss over time. The temporal progression of depressive symptoms showed high correspondence between both data sources (ÃÂ=0.76-0.93; P&lt;.001), except for diminished interest and depressed mood, which showed a steady increase even after the relaxation of the contact ban among the Twitter respondents but not among the survey respondents. Overall, the results indicate relatively small differences in depressive symptoms associated with social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need to differentiate between positive (eg, energy level) and negative (eg, depressed mood) associations and variations over time. The results also underscore previous suggestions of Twitter data's potential to help identify hot spots of declining and improving public mental health and thereby help provide early intervention measures, especially for young and middle-aged adults. Further efforts are needed to investigate the long-term consequences of recurring lockdown phases and to address the limitations of social media data such as Twitter data to establish real-time public mental surveillance approaches.","Cohrdes, Yenikent, Wu, Ghanem, Franco-Salvador, Vogelgesang","https://doi.org/10.2196/27140","20210621","COVID-19; GEDA/EHIS survey; Twitter; data; data correspondence; depression; depressive symptoms; infodemiology; infoveillance; mental health; monitoring; pandemic; public health; public mental health surveillance; social contact ban; social media; surveillance; survey; symptom; temporal progression; twitter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15215,""
"Specialization Within a Specialty: Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nursing Pathways for the Greatest Good","Dr. Hildegard Peplau's theory on the primacy of the therapeutic interpersonal relationship remains central to the role of the psychiatric-mental health advanced practice nurse (PMH APN). In 1989, Peplau published her thoughts on how World War II (WWII) shaped early PMH APN practice. Following WWII and the return of hundreds of thousands of previously mentally healthy service members with combat-related psychiatric symptoms and disorders, the prevailing societal beliefs about mental illness began to shift from an innate/inherited etiological perspective to a broader appreciation of the additional contributions of social and environmental factors to mental well-being. With that awareness came a decrease in stigma and a shift from housing patients in psychiatric hospitals to treating them in community settings. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has likewise affected societal beliefs through exposure to the mental toll of massive infection rates, loss of life, social isolation, and other downstream consequences. During these times of crises, psychiatric nurses and educators are challenged to provide innovative solutions to meet the increased demands for psychosocial care.

"COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress disorder among nurses: a descriptive cross-sectional study in a COVID hospital","In March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. Healthcare professionals directly involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study investigated the prevalence of PTSD among nurses working in a COVID hospital and evaluated associated factors. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Crema Hospital and the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) was administered. Data collection took place from July to September 2020, during which 275 questionnaires were distributed. Of the total sample, 39.88% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis deserving of further analysis. Nurses stated that they were predominantly overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts (M = 1.55). Working in the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR=2.40; p=0.02), irregular work shifts (OR=5.41; p=0.01) and coming from a mental health ward (OR=3.80; p=0.02) increased the risk of receiving a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Our findings showed significantly higher IES-R scores among women than among men (p = 0.01). The activities that caused the most distress were related to technical skills required for managing ventilation and intubation devices. The results of the study highlighted the presence of considerable psychological distress in the sample. There is an urgent need to monitor the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and implement early intervention measures.","Marcomini, Agus, Milani, Sfogliarini, Bona, Castagna","https://doi.org/10.23749/mdl.v112i3.11129","20210621","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Nurses; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15217,""
"Drawing Parallels Among Past Public Health Crises and COVID-19","In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare personnel across severely affected regions. Along with a lack of testing, these shortages delayed surveillance, and possible containment of the virus. The pandemic also took unprecedented tolls on the mental health of many healthcare workers who treated and witnessed the deaths of critically ill patients. To address these effects and prepare for a potential second wave, a literature review was performed on the response of healthcare systems during the Influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, 2009, and the epidemics of Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). We can use lessons identified to develop a competent and effective response to the current and future pandemics. The public must continue to engage in proper health mitigation strategies including utilization of face coverings, physical distancing, and hand washing. The impact the pandemic has had on the mental health of frontline healthcare workers cannot be disregarded as it is essential in ensuring effective patient care and mitigating psychological comorbidities. The lessons identified from past public health crises can help contain and limit morbidity and mortality with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Contreras, Burcescu, Dang, Freeman, Gilbreth, Jacobson, Jayaseelan, Markenson","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.202","20210618","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15218,""

"Effects of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Anxiety and Eating Behavior-A Longitudinal Study","As social animals, humans need to live in groups. This contact with conspecifics is essential for their evolution and survival. Among the recommendations to reduce transmission of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19 are social distancing and home confinement. These measures may negatively affect the social life and, consequently, the emotional state and eating behavior of individuals. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety, premenstrual symptoms, and eating behavior of young women. Data collection was conducted in person (prepandemic-from March to December 2019) and online (during the pandemic-August 2020). A total of 71 participants, average age of 21.26 years (SD = 0.41), took part in the study. Trait anxiety during the pandemic was significantly lower than in the prepandemic period. Investigation of the &quot;anxiety/stress&quot; symptom of the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) revealed that this symptom was more severe before the pandemic. There was a decline in the desire for sweet and fatty foods during the pandemic. However, craving for traditional foods rose significantly in the same period. Uncontrolled and emotional eating were significantly lower during the pandemic. The results suggest that the pandemic may have had a positive impact on anxiety and eating behavior of the participants, which may be due to differences between urban and rural populations and the latter living with their families.

"Fear in the Chinese Population: Influential Patterns in the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Major global public health emergencies challenge public mental health. Negative emotions, and especially fear, may endanger social stability. To better cope with epidemics and pandemics, early emotional guidance should be provided based on an understanding of the status of public emotions in the given circumstances. From January 27 to February 11, 2020 (during which the cases of COVID-19 were increasing), a national online survey of the Chinese public was conducted. A total of 132,482 respondents completed a bespoke questionnaire, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire (BEQ). Results showed that at the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, 53.0% of the Chinese population reported varying degrees of fear, mostly mild. As seen from regression analysis, for individuals who were unmarried and with a relatively higher educational level, living in city or area with fewer confirmed cases, cognitive reappraisal, positive expressivity and negative inhibition were the protective factors of fear. For participants being of older age, female, a patient or medical staff member, risk perception, negative expressivity, positive impulse strength and negative impulse strength were the risk factors for fear. The levels of fear and avoidant behavior tendencies were risk factors for disturbed physical function. Structural equation modeling suggested that fear emotion had a mediation between risk perception and escape behavior and physical function disturbance. The findings help to reveal the public emotional status at the early stage of the pandemic based on a large Chinese sample, allowing targeting of the groups that most need emotional guidance under crisis. Findings also provide evidence of the need for psychological assistance in future major public health emergencies.","Chen, Sun, Xie, Zhang, Shen, Chen, Yuan, Shi, Qin, Liu, Wang, Dai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.567364","20210619","COVID-19; Chinese population; fear; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15222,""
"Psychological Distress, Social Support, Coping Style, and Perceived Stress Among Medical Staff and Medical Students in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Epidemic in China","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has had impact that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. The present study was aimed to better understand psychological status among medical staff and medical students during the early epidemic and to explore the influence factors of psychological distress. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted online from February 2-14, 2020. We collected general information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents were assessed using the Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors influencing psychological distress. <b>Results:</b> Five hundred and twenty-eight respondents returned valid questionnaires. Medical staff and Medical students scored averages of 6.77 Ã‚Â± 5.04, 15.48 Ã‚Â± 8.66 on the K6, 37.22 Ã‚Â± 11.39, 22.62 Ã‚Â± 11.25 on the SSRS and 18.52 Ã‚Â± 7.54, 28.49 Ã‚Â± 11.17 on the PSS, respectively. Most medical staff (279, 91.77%) and 148 medical students (66.07%) showed a positive coping style. Social support, perceived stress, hours spent watching epidemic-related information per day and frequency of epidemic-related dreams were identified as factors influencing psychological distress among medical staff and medical students. Coping style emerged as a determinant of psychological distress among medical staff. <b>Conclusions:</b> In the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, medical staff and medical students were at moderate to high risk of psychological distress. Our results suggest that psychological interventions designed to strengthen social support, reduce perceived stress and adopt a positive coping style may be effective at improving the mental health of medical staff and medical students.","Li, Yi, Zhong, Li, Xiang, Wu, Xiong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.664808","20210619","COVID-19; coping style; medical staff; medical students; psychological distress; social support; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15223,""
"Role of DAMPs in respiratory virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome-with a preliminary reference to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia","When surveying the current literature on COVID-19, the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; is considered to be pathogenetically involved in its severe outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and eventually multiple organ failure. In this review, the similar role of DAMPs is addressed, that is, of those molecules, which operate upstream of the inflammatory pathway by activating those cells, which ultimately release the cytokines. Given the still limited reports on their role in COVID-19, the emerging topic is extended to respiratory viral infections with focus on influenza. At first, a brief introduction is given on the function of various classes of activating DAMPs and counterbalancing suppressing DAMPs (SAMPs) in initiating controlled inflammation-promoting and inflammation-resolving defense responses upon infectious and sterile insults. It is stressed that the excessive emission of DAMPs upon severe injury uncovers their fateful property in triggering dysregulated life-threatening hyperinflammatory responses. Such a scenario may happen when the viral load is too high, for example, in the respiratory tract, &quot;forcing&quot; many virus-infected host cells to decide to commit &quot;suicidal&quot; regulated cell death (e.g., necroptosis, pyroptosis) associated with release of large amounts of DAMPs: an important topic of this review. Ironically, although the aim of this &quot;suicidal&quot; cell death is to save and restore organismal homeostasis, the intrinsic release of excessive amounts of DAMPs leads to those dysregulated hyperinflammatory responses-as typically involved in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in respiratory viral infections. Consequently, as briefly outlined in this review, these molecules can be considered valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to monitor and evaluate the course of the viral disorder, in particular, to grasp the eventual transition precociously from a controlled defense response as observed in mild/moderate cases to a dysregulated life-threatening hyperinflammatory response as seen, for example, in severe/fatal COVID-19. Moreover, the pathogenetic involvement of these molecules qualifies them as relevant future therapeutic targets to prevent severe/ fatal outcomes. Finally, a theory is presented proposing that the superimposition of coronavirus-induced DAMPs with non-virus-induced DAMPs from other origins such as air pollution or high age may contribute to severe and fatal courses of coronavirus pneumonia.","Land","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41435-021-00140-w","20210618","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15224,""

The Basic Social Process was recognised to involve Tragic Choices, conceptualised through an EGT including Tragic personal and professional choices including concerns over personnel protective equipment (PPE), protecting themselves and their families, impact on mental health and difficult clinical decisions, Tragic organisational choices including decision making support, communication, mental health and well-being and Tragic societal choices involving public shows of support, utilisation and resourcing of health services. Rich insights were revealed into paramedic care during the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with other research. This care was provided in the context of competing and conflicting decisions and resources, where Tragic Choices have to be made which may challenge life's pricelessness. Well-being support, clinical decision making, appropriate PPE and healthcare resourcing are all influenced by choices made before and during the pandemic, and will continue as we recover and plan for future pandemics. The impact of COVID-19 may persist, especially if we fail to learn, if not we risk losing more lives in this and future pandemics and threatening the overwhelming collective effort which united society in hardship when responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

"Moral distress and ethical climate in intensive care medicine during COVID-19: a nationwide study","The COVID-19 pandemic has created ethical challenges for intensive care unit (ICU) professionals, potentially causing moral distress. This study explored the levels and causes of moral distress and the ethical climate in Dutch ICUs during COVID-19. An extended version of the Measurement of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) and Ethical Decision Making Climate Questionnaire (EDMCQ) were online distributed among all 84 ICUs. Moral distress scores in nurses and intensivists were compared with the historical control group one year before COVID-19. Three hundred forty-five nurses (70.7%), 40 intensivists (8.2%), and 103 supporting staff (21.1%) completed the survey. Moral distress levels were higher for nurses than supporting staff. Moral distress levels in intensivists did not differ significantly from those of nurses and supporting staff. &quot;Inadequate emotional support for patients and their families&quot; was the highest-ranked cause of moral distress for all groups of professionals. Of all factors, all professions rated the ethical climate most positively regarding the culture of mutual respect, Ã‚Â ethical awareness and support. &quot;Culture of not avoiding end-of-life-decisions&quot; and &quot;Self-reflective and empowering leadership&quot; received the lowest mean scores. Moral distress scores during COVID-19 were significantly lower for ICU nurses (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and intensivists (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) compared to one year prior. Levels and causes of moral distress vary between ICU professionals and differ from the historical control group. Targeted interventions that address moral distress during a crisis are desirable to improve the mental health and retention of ICU professionals and the quality of patient care.","Donkers, Gilissen, Candel, van Dijk, Kling, Heijnen-Panis, Pragt, van der Horst, Pronk, van Mook","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-021-00641-3","20210618","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Doctors; Ethical climate; Intensive care medicine; Intensivists; Moral distress; Nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15227,""
"The effect of COVID-19 restrictions on rehabilitation and functional outcome following total hip and knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the pandemic","The primary aim was to assess the patient-perceived effect of restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 on rehabilitation following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Secondary aims were to assess perceived restrictions, influence on mental health, and functional outcome compared to patients undergoing surgery without restriction. During February and March 2020, 105 patients underwent THA (n = 48) or TKA (n = 57) and completed preoperative and six-month postoperative assessments. A cohort of 415 patients undergoing surgery in 2019 were used as the control. Patient demographic data, BMI, comorbidities, Oxford Hip Score (OHS) or Knee Score (OKS), and EuroQoL five-domain (EQ-5D) score were collected preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. At six months postoperatively, the 2020 patients were also asked to complete a questionnaire relating to the effect of the social restrictions on their outcome and their mental health. Nearly half of the patients (47.6%, n = 50/105) felt that the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 had limited their rehabilitation and were associated with a significantly worse postoperative OKS (p &lt; 0.001), EQ-5D score (p &lt; 0.001), and lower satisfaction rate (p = 0.019). The reasons for the perceived limited rehabilitation were: being unable to exercise (n = 32, 64%), limited access to physiotherapy (n = 30, 60%), and no face-to-face follow-up (n = 30, 60%). A quarter (n = 26) felt that their mental health had deteriorated postoperatively; 17.1% (n = 18) felt depressed and 26.7% (n = 28) felt anxious. Joint-specific scores and satisfaction for the 2020 group were no different to the 2019 group, however patients undergoing THA in 2020 had a significantly worse postoperative EQ-5D compared to the 2019 cohort (difference 0.106; p = 0.001) which was not observed in patients undergoing TKA. Half of the 2020 cohort felt that their rehabilitation had been limited and was associated with worse postoperative Oxford and EQ-5D scores, and lower rates of patient satisfaction, but relative to the 2019 cohort their overall outcomes were no different, with the exception of THA patients who had a worse general health score.

"Impact of COVID-19 on medical students' mental wellbeing in Jordan","COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has resulted in significant morbidity, mortality, and negative psychological impact. This prospective cross-sectional study is exploring the effect of the pandemic on mental health of medical students. The study was conducted at six Jordanian medical schools using an online survey to collect students' socio-demographic and academic data. Assessment of mental wellbeing status was done using Kessler's psychological stress scale (K10); the impact of COVID-19 on life activities and strategies followed to manage the situation were also examined. A total of 553 medical students were recruited for the study. Men constituted 40.1%, and women were 59.9%. Students reported that COVID-19 has affected the aspects of physical fitness (73.1%), study (68.4%), and social relationships (65.6%) the most. Sixty-six percent of the students were concerned about family members' affection, and more than half (58.4%) explained their concerns about the inability to get clinical sessions and labs. Cooking, baking, and hobby practicing were the most popular methods to improve their mental wellbeing. About half of the participants had a severe mental disorder, and only 13.2% were likely to be well. The study indicates that half of our medical students suffer severe mental disorders, with physical fitness, exercise, and studying being among the most affected aspects during the COVID 19 pandemic. It is recommended that measures need be taken to alleviate students' stress, which might have deleterious effects in many aspects.","Seetan, Al-Zubi, Rubbai, Athamneh, Khamees, Radaideh","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253295","20210617","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15230,""
"Varied and unexpected changes in the well-being of seniors in the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic","Recent evidence suggests that psychological health deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic but far less is known about changes in other measures of well-being. We examined changes in a broad set of measures of well-being among seniors just before and after the recognition of community spread of COVID-19 in the United States. We fielded two waves of a survey to a large, national online panel of adults ages 60 to 68 at wave 1. We measured depressive symptoms, negative affect, positive affect, pain, life satisfaction and self-rated health in each survey wave. 16,644 adults answered well-being questions in waves 1 and 2 of our survey (mean[SD]: age 64 [2.6]; 10,165 women [61%]; 15,161 [91%] white). We found large (20%; p&lt;0.001) increases in the rate of depressive symptoms (1.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.86) and negative mood (0.225 scale points; 95% CI, 0.205 to 0.245) but no change in self-reported health and a decrease (12.5%; p&lt;0.001) in the rate of self-reported pain (5 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.8 to -4.3). Depressive symptoms and negative affect increased more for women. Higher perceived risk of getting COVID-19 and of dying from the disease were associated with larger increases in the rate of depressive symptoms and negative affect and larger decreases in positive affect and life satsifaction. COVID-19 related job/income loss was the only pandemic-related factor predictive of the decline in pain. Although depressive symptoms and mood worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, other measures of well-being were either not materially affected or even improved.","Barcellos, Jacobson, Stone","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252962","20210617","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15231,""
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on psychosocial factors, health, and lifestyle in Scottish octogenarians: The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study","Little is known about effects of COVID-19 lockdown on psychosocial factors, health and lifestyle in older adults, particularly those aged over 80 years, despite the risks posed by COVID-19 to this age group. Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 members, residing mostly in Edinburgh and the surrounding Lothians regions in Scotland, mean age 84 years (SD = 0.3), responded to an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n = 190). We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes. Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity. In multivariable regression models, adherence to guidance by leaving the house less often associated with less professional occupational class (OR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.98) and poorer self-rated general health (OR = 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92). Increased internet use associated with female sex (OR = 2.32, 95%CI 1.12-4.86) and higher general cognitive ability (OR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.03-2.33).

"Mental Health Among Parents of Children Aged &lt;18 Years and Unpaid Caregivers of Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, December 2020 and February-Ã¢ÂÂ March 2021","Early during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly two thirds of unpaid caregivers of adults reported adverse mental or behavioral health symptoms, compared with approximately one third of noncaregivers<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup> (1). In addition, 27% of parents of children aged &lt;18 years reported that their mental health had worsened during the pandemic (2). To examine mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. adults on the basis of their classification as having a parenting role (i.e., unpaid persons caring for children and adolescents aged &lt;18 years, referred to as children in this report) or being an unpaid caregiver of adults (i.e., persons caring for adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years),<sup>Ã‚Â§</sup> CDC analyzed data from cross-sectional surveys that were administered during December 2020 and February-March 2021 for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative.<sup>Ã‚Â¶</sup> Respondents were categorized as parents only, caregivers of adults only, parents-caregivers (persons in both roles), or nonparents/noncaregivers (persons in neither role). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for any adverse mental health symptoms, particularly suicidal ideation, were higher among all respondents who were parents, caregivers of adults, or both compared with respondents who were nonparents/noncaregivers and were highest among persons in both roles (parents-caregivers) (any adverse mental health symptoms: aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.1-6.2; serious suicidal ideation: aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.2, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.5-10.4). These findings highlight that parents and caregivers, especially those balancing roles both as parents and caregivers, experienced higher levels of adverse mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic than adults without these responsibilities. Caregivers who had someone to rely on for support had lower odds of experiencing any adverse mental health symptoms.

"Emergency Department Visits for Suspected Suicide Attempts Among Persons Aged 12-25 Years Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, January 2019-May 2021","Beginning in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and response, which included physical distancing and stay-at-home orders, disrupted daily life in the United States. Compared with the rate in 2019, a 31% increase in the proportion of mental health-related emergency department (ED) visits occurred among adolescents aged 12-17 years in 2020 (1). In June 2020, 25% of surveyed adults aged 18-24 years reported experiencing suicidal ideation related to the pandemic in the past 30 days (2). More recent patterns of ED visits for suspected suicide attempts among these age groups are unclear. Using data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP),* CDC examined trends in ED visits for suspected suicide attempts<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup> during January 1, 2019-May 15, 2021, among persons aged 12-25 years, by sex, and at three distinct phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with the corresponding period in 2019, persons aged 12-25 years made fewer ED visits for suspected suicide attempts during March 29-April 25, 2020. However, by early May 2020, ED visit counts for suspected suicide attempts began increasing among adolescents aged 12-17 years, especially among girls. During July 26-August 22, 2020, the mean weekly number of ED visits for suspected suicide attempts among girls aged 12-17 years was 26.2% higher than during the same period a year earlier; during February 21-March 20, 2021, mean weekly ED visit counts for suspected suicide attempts were 50.6% higher among girls aged 12-17 years compared with the same period in 2019. Suicide prevention measures focused on young persons call for a comprehensive approach, that is adapted during times of infrastructure disruption, involving multisectoral partnerships (e.g., public health, mental health, schools, and families) and implementation of evidence-based strategies (3) that address the range of factors influencing suicide risk.","Yard, Radhakrishnan, Ballesteros, Sheppard, Gates, Stein, Hartnett, Kite-Powell, Rodgers, Adjemian, Ehlman, Holland, Idaikkadar, Ivey-Stephenson, Martinez, Law, Stone","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7024e1","20210621","Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Child; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Male; Suicide, Attempted; United States; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15234,""
"The Burden of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Its Complications in Patients With Atopic Dermatitis-A Nested Case-Control Study","The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is poorly understood. The aims of the study were to characterize a large cohort of COVID-19-positive adult patients with AD and to identify predictors of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. A population-based nested case-control study was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of predictors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. Of 78,073 adult patients with AD, 3618 (4.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. Subclinical COVID-19 infection occurred in 3368 (93.1%) of COVID-19-positive patients, whereas 123 (3.4%), 46 (1.3%), 55 (1.5%), and 26 (0.7%) patients developed a mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Altogether, 250 patients (6.0%) were hospitalized, and 40 patients (1.1%) died because of COVID-19 complications. Coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization was independently associated with the intake of extended courses of systemic corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.14; P = 0.005). None of AD-related variables independently predicted COVID-19-associated mortality. The presence of comorbid metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure, and depression projected both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. Prolonged systemic corticosteroids during the pandemic are associated with increased odds of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and should be avoided in patients with AD.","Kridin, Schonmann, Tzur Bitan, Damiani, Weinstein, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.1097/DER.0000000000000772","20210617","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15235,""
"Psychological science and COVID-19: An agenda for social action","This report summarizes what is known about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes ways for psychology organizations to engage in addressing pandemic-related challenges. A stress and coping framework is used to describe key factors that account for mental health difficulties resulting from the stress of pandemics including the pandemic course, political leadership and public response, cumulative stressors, risk and protective factors, and coping strategies. Psychology organizations could do much to provide help particularly to vulnerable healthcare and frontline workers, the elderly, and the socially isolated. They could offer clinical services and design prevention programs, train non-professional community workers to provide mental health first aid, assist NGO's and political leaders, and translate basic research on psychological factors that influence acceptance of public health measures. The pandemic occurs at a time of advanced connectivity that provides an opportunity for (a) scientific information exchange, (b) alleviation of distress of social isolation, but also (c) infodemic, unprecedented spread of hoaxes and online incitements to non-compliance with preventative measures. Psychology's role is not limited to addressing mental health needs but also includes promoting adjustment to changes in the economy, education and employment, and developing effective communication strategies that encourage acceptance of public health measures.

"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on perceived discrimination and internalized stigma in people with previous mental disorder diagnoses in Spain","COVID-19 disease control efforts and consequences are likely to be complicated by the impact of fear and stigmatization of the novel coronavirus. These complications may also worsen due to the potential compounding of COVID-19 related stigma with stigmatization associated with previously diagnosed conditions. This exploratory study analyzes the experiences of the stigma associated with COVID-19 lockdown in people with different previous diagnoses 2 and 5 weeks after the beginning of the state of emergency in Spain. Gender and age were controlled as covariables and 1,052 people participated in the study. The diagnosis groups were: Psychiatry and mental health (n = 71), Cardiovascular disease (n = 42), Neurological disease (n = 23), Lung disease (n = 53), and No diagnosis (n = 863). The instruments used to measure the stigma were the Intersectional Day-to-Day Discrimination Index and two items of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale. Analysis of covariance of repeated measures and analysis of variance, including Scheffe's post hoc test, were performed. We found significant differences in stigma among the first and second evaluation. Regarding the previous diagnosis, no differences were found at Time 1, but significant differences were found at Time 2, with those having a previous psychiatric or mental health diagnosis reporting higher levels of perceived discrimination and internalized stigmatization. Our results suggest that people with previous stigmatizing conditions might be more vulnerable to experiencing stigma in a confinement situation. In order to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 stigma, health interventions should also consider the resulting intersection of effects on internalized stigma and perceived discrimination.

"Shared trauma, resilience, and growth: A roadmap toward transcultural conceptualization","<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> Countless communities worldwide are exposed directly and subsequently to the effects of massive-scale collective stressors, from natural disasters to human-caused. In contexts of collective adversity, health care providers who are also members of these communities share and interdependently affect the range of responses their patients have. We aim to conceptualize this spectrum, termed shared trauma, shared resilience, and shared growth. <b> <i>Method:</i> </b> In this metasynthesis, we review the literature on these underacknowledged dynamics globally. We include prior conceptualizations of direct and indirect trauma, collective trauma, cultural context, and the COVID-19 pandemic toward clearer conceptualization of shared mental health in global collective stressor contexts. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Most trauma and resilience research focuses on prevailing concepts and measures with questionable cross-cultural applicability. These works usually center on acute, highly distressing threats to physical safety at the individual level. The scarce literature on shared trauma describes it as a rare phenomenon, entailing conflicting messages of narrative accounts within contexts of few cultures with medium to high degrees of individualism. There has been little consideration of other non-Western and indigenous communities with more collectivist values and collective trauma histories. There is limited understanding of these concepts as they pertain to the vast majority of cultures. As a result, shared trauma, resilience, and growth have been poorly conceptualized, differentiated, or empirically researched. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> We propose uniquely inclusive models of shared trauma, resilience, and growth. These models reflect the cumulative effects and interplay of direct to indirect, acute to chronic, individual to collective, and historic to transgenerational factors influenced by cultural context.

"The association of transmission concerns and social distance from loved ones with distress in medical professionals providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City","Health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic report high levels of psychological distress. We examined whether concerns regarding transmission of COVID-19 to loved ones and social distancing from loved ones were associated with HCWs' distress. We tested whether living with others modified these associations. HCWs at a New York City academic medical center (<i>N</i> = 767; 80.7% female, 58.5% White) enrolled in the COVID-19 Health Care Provider Study and completed a web-based survey between April 9, 2020 and May 11, 2020. Controlling for demographics, distress regarding potential transmission to loved ones and social distancing from loved ones were each significantly associated with higher odds of a positive screen for acute stress, depression, and anxiety (<i>OR</i>s = 1.29-1.59, all <i>p</i>s &lt; .01). Living with others was associated with lower odds of a positive screen for depression and anxiety, though the protective effect for anxiety was evident only for HCWs with no distress regarding transmission concerns. Transmission concerns and social distancing from loved ones were associated with greater odds of psychological distress, whereas living with others was associated with lower odds of distress. Interventions should consider ways to facilitate the ability of HCWs to receive social support from loved ones, while simultaneously protecting their family's health.

"Hot, cold, or both? A person-centered perspective on death awareness during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic-as an omnipresent mortality cue-heightens employees' awareness of their mortality and vulnerability. Extant research has identified two distinct forms of death awareness: death anxiety and death reflection. Because researchers have exclusively examined death anxiety and death reflection as independent and unique variables across individuals while overlooking their interplay and co-existence within individuals, we know little about whether and why employees can have different combined experiences of two forms of death awareness over a certain period of time (e.g., during the pandemic), and how these different employee experiences relate to theoretically and practically important work-relevant consequences. To address this gap in our knowledge, we adopted a person-centered approach using latent profile analysis to consider death anxiety and death reflection conjointly within employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across two studies, we identified three distinct death awareness profiles-the disengaged, calm reflectors, and anxious reflectors-and found membership in these profiles systematically varied according to health- (e.g., risk of severe illness from COVID-19), work- (e.g., job-required human contact), and community-related (e.g., the number of regional infections) factors influencing the self-relevance of COVID-19 as a mortality cue. In addition, we found that these death awareness profiles differentially predicted important employee outcomes, including well-being (i.e., depression and emotional exhaustion) and prosocial behaviors at work (i.e., organizational citizenship behaviors and pro-diversity behavior).

"Exploring public sentiment on enforced remote work during COVID-19","Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many employees have been strongly encouraged or mandated to work from home. The present study sought to understand the attitudes and experiences of the general public toward remote work by analyzing Twitter data from March 30 to July 5 of 2020. We web scraped over 1 million tweets using keywords such as &quot;telework,&quot; &quot;work from home,&quot; &quot;remote work,&quot; and so forth, and analyzed the content using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis results show generally positive attitudes expressed by remote work-related tweets, with minor dips during the weekend. Topic modeling results uncovered themes among tweets including home office, cybersecurity, mental health, work-life balance, teamwork, and leadership, with minor changes in topics revealed over the 14-week period. Findings point to topics of particular concern regarding working from home and can help guide hypothesis generation for future research.

"Sleep in a pandemic: Implications of COVID-19 for sleep through the lens of the 3P model of insomnia","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has fundamentally altered daily life across the globe, and the stress associated with these changes is likely to impact sleep. Sleep is critical for physical and mental health; thus, understanding the factors that may contribute to poor sleep during the pandemic represents a first step in identifying behavioral health targets for intervention efforts during and after the pandemic. This review first summarizes the developing research on sleep during the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on sleep is then examined through the lens of the 3P model of insomnia by proposing pandemic-specific predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The potential consequences of sleep disturbance on physical and mental health conditions most relevant to the pandemic are also reviewed. Finally, recommendations for reducing or eliminating pandemic-specific perpetuating factors are detailed, highlighting the potential utility of behavioral sleep medicine interventions in the integration of behavioral health responses and public health initiatives during and after the pandemic.

"The relation between age and experienced stress, worry, affect, and depression during the spring 2020 phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","Advanced age is often associated with increased emotional well-being, with older adults reporting more positive and less negative affect than younger adults. Here, we test whether this pattern held during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that disproportionately put older adults at risk. We additionally examine potential moderating effects of daily activity and social connectedness, which have been shown to benefit mental health across the life span. We regularly assessed a large sample of adults ages 18-89 using online surveys. As preregistered for this report (https://osf.io/tb4qv), we focus on self-reported measures of affect, depression, stress, and worry as well as self-reported daily activity and perception of social isolation during two time windows for adults in the United States: early (mid-March to early April) and later (mid-April to early May) periods during the spring phase of the pandemic. Increased age benefited emotional well-being for multiple metrics during both time windows assessed. Furthermore, the results confirmed that exercise and perception of social connectedness can buffer against negative mental health outcomes across all ages, although the beneficial effects of age remained even when controlling for these influences. The one exception was worry about one's own health: Once exercise and social connectedness were controlled, increased age was associated with more worry. The results overall suggest that, at least among adults with access to technology, older age was associated with greater resilience during the spring phase of the pandemic. Thus, increased resilience of older adults demonstrated previously extends to the context of the onset of a pandemic.

"COVID-19: Impact, experiences and support needs of children and young adults with Cystic Fibrosis and parents","Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 and the United Kingdom's (UK) national shielding advice on people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their families. This study explored the experiences and support needs of children and young adults (CYAs) with CF, and parents who have a child with CF during the COVID-19 pandemic. CYAs with CF and parents of CYAs with CF completed a UK wide online survey with open and closed questions exploring experiences, information and support needs and decision-making processes. Qualitative thematic content analysis and descriptive quantitative analyses were undertaken. CYAs aged 10-30 years (n=99) and parents of CYAs aged 0-34 years (n=145) responded. Parents (72.7%) and CYAs (50.0%) worried about the virus, and both were vigilant for virus symptoms (82.7% and 79.7%). Over three-quarters of CYAs were worried about their own health if they caught the virus. CYAs worried about feeling more isolated during the virus (64.9%). Qualitative findings reported the following themes: 1) Disruption- caused by isolation 2) Impact on psychological wellbeing 3) Safety of Shielding and 4) Healthcare and Treatment provision- changes to care, access and support. The impact of COVID-19 and UK shielding advice to have no contact with anyone outside the household caused disruption to the lives and routines of individuals in relation to work, education, social lives, relationships, CF management routines and support. Parents and CYAs highlighted the need for clear, up-to-date and tailored advice on individualised risks and shielding. This article is protected by copyright.

"Health and Economic Outcomes Associated With COVID-19 in Women at High Risk of HIV Infection in Rural Kenya","COVID-19 lockdowns may affect economic and health outcomes, but evidence from low- and middle-income countries remains limited. To assess the economic security, food security, health, and sexual behavior of women at high risk of HIV infection in rural Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey study of women enrolled in a randomized trial in a rural county in Kenya combined results from phone interviews, conducted while social distancing measures were in effect between May 13 and June 29, 2020, with longitudinal, in-person surveys administered between September 1, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Enrolled participants were HIV-negative and had 2 or more sexual partners within the past month. Surveys collected information on economic conditions, food security, health status, and sexual behavior. Subgroup analyses compared outcomes by reliance on transactional sex for income and by educational attainment. Data were analyzed between May 2020 and April 2021. Self-reported income, employment hours, numbers of sexual partners and transactional sex partners, food security, and COVID-19 prevention behaviors. A total of 1725 women participated, with a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.8) years and 1170 (68.0%) reporting sex work as an income source before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, participants reported experiencing a 52% decline in mean (SD) weekly income, from $11.25 (13.46) to $5.38 (12.51) (difference, -$5.86; 95% CI, -$6.91 to -$4.82; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In all, 1385 participants (80.3%) reported difficulty obtaining food in the past month, and 1500 (87.0%) worried about having enough to eat at least once. Reported numbers of sexual partners declined from a mean (SD) total of 1.8 (1.2) partners before COVID-19 to 1.1 (1.0) during (difference, -0.75 partners; 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.67 partners; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and transactional sex partners declined from 1.0 (1.1) to 0.5 (0.8) (difference, -0.57 partners; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.50 partners; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In subgroup analyses, women reliant on transactional sex for income were 18.3% (95% CI, 11.4% to 25.2%) more likely to report being sometimes or often worried that their household would have enough food than women not reliant on transactional sex (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and their reported decline in employment was 4.6 hours (95% CI, -7.9 to -1.2 hours) greater than women not reliant on transactional sex (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.008). In this survey study, COVID-19 was associated with large reductions in economic security among women at high risk of HIV infection in Kenya. However, shifts in sexual behavior may have temporarily decreased their risk of HIV infection.","Kavanagh, Marcus, Bosire, Otieno, Bair, Agot, Thirumurthy","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.13787","20210618","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15246,""
"App-based services to overcome COVID-19: development, acceptance, and concerns in South Korea","Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), South Korea has been engaged in various efforts to overcome the pandemic. One of them is to provide app-based COVID-19-related services. As the pandemic appears to be prolonged, a need for various apps has emerged. Thus, these COVID-19 apps support activities aimed at overcoming COVID-19. We aimed to determine which apps were the most necessary according to users and the current status of the development of COVID-19-related apps in South Korea. We also aimed to determine users' acceptance and concerns related to using apps to support activities to overcome COVID-19. We collected data from 1,148 users from an online survey between November 11 and December 6, 2020. Basic statistical analysis, multiple response analysis, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted using R. We manually classified the current status of the development of COVID-19-related apps. In total, 68.4% of the respondents showed high willingness to protect themselves from COVID-19 by using related apps. The epidemiological investigation app (62%) was marked as the most necessary app; the self-management app for self-isolation (54%), self-route management app (53%), COVID-19 symptom management app (42%), and mental health management app (24%), respectively, were deemed as the next most necessary. Despite the high intention to use, people were also concerned about privacy issues and media exposure. Those who had an underlying disease and had experience using COVID-19-related apps showed significantly higher intentions to use the related apps(P=.05 and P=.01). It is very important to target users to design and develop the most necessary apps. Furthermore, to gain the public's trust and make the apps available to as many people as possible, it is vital to develop diverse apps in which privacy is maximally protected.","Park, Han, Kim, Rho","https://doi.org/10.2196/29315","20210617","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15247,""
"History of contact with the SARS-COV-2 virus and the sense of coherence in the development of psychological distress in the occupational health professionals in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological well-being of healthcare professionals, among them, on medical and nursing occupational specialists. This study describes the psychological distress that this group has suffered, analyzing the effect that the sense of coherence related with the history of contact with infected people has generated in their mental health. Cross-sectional descriptive study using online questionnaires. Data were collected on a sample of 499 subjects, representing 42.0% and 38.8% of the associations of specialists in Occupational Medicine and Nursing, respectively. A univariate data analysis, independence test, and the CHAID multivariate method were carried out. The percentage of workers with high psychological distress was higher among women than among men; this was also higher in public sector workers than in the private sector. No differences have been observed regarding psychological distress and educational level, coexistence, having children, working away from home, having a pet, or between being a physician or nurse. The most efficient measure to prevent psychological distress was acting regarding the comprehensibility dimension of the sense of coherence. Sex, contact with any infected person, age, living as a couple, working in public or private centers, the availability of diagnostic tests, and the correlation with the manageability dimension were modulating factors. Sense of coherence is an effective measure to prevent psychological distress due to contact with people affected by COVID-19 in Occupational Health professionals.","GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado, Ortega-Moreno, Soriano, Fagundo-Rivera, Allande-CussÃƒÂ³, Ruiz-Frutos","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211026121","20210618","COVID-19; Occupational practice; occupational health professionals; psychological distress; sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15248,""
"Posttraumatic Stress in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Prevalence and Relationships to Patient-Reported Outcomes","Patients with chronic illness are at increased risk for traumatic stress because of medical trauma. Initial studies of posttraumatic stress (PTS) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have found that approximately one-third of patients may experience significant PTS symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, disrupted sleep, and low mood. We aim to better characterize PTS in IBD and its relationship with patient outcomes in a large cohort of patients with IBD. Adult patients registered with the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation/University of North Carolina IBD Partners database were invited to complete a supplementary survey between February and July 2020. The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition was administered as a supplemental survey. Additional data from IBD Partners included disease severity, surgery and hospital history, demographics, and health care utilization. A total of 797 patients participated (452 with Crohn disease, 345 with ulcerative colitis). No impacts on response patterns because of the COVID-19 pandemic were found. Although 5.6% of the sample reported an existing PTS diagnosis because of IBD experiences, 9.6% of participants met the full IBD-related PTS diagnostic criteria per the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition. Female patients, younger patients, those with less educational attainment, non-White patients, and Hispanic patients reported higher levels of PTS symptoms. Patients with higher PTS symptoms were more likely to have been hospitalized, have had surgery, have more severe symptoms, and not be in remission. Increased PTS was also associated with increased anxiety, depression, pain interference, fatigue, and health care utilization. The present findings support prior research that approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients with IBD report significant symptoms of PTS directly from their disease experiences, and certain demographic groups are at higher risk. In addition, PTS is associated with several IBD outcomes. Patients with higher PTS symptoms are less likely to be in remission and may utilize more outpatient gastrointestinal services. Intervention trials to mitigate PTS symptoms in patients with IBD are warranted.","Taft, Quinton, Jedel, Simons, Mutlu, Hanauer","https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izab152","20210617","inflammatory bowel disease; medical trauma; post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15249,""

Participants were divided into low, middle, and high groups according to the degree of the epidemic in their region of residence. Related factors were analyzed using the chi-squared test. The relationship between COVID-19 epidemic regions and depression risks and anxiety using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Kessler 6 scale (K6) was evaluated using a univariate and multivariable logistic regression model. Overall, 7775 cases, including 4798 pregnant and 2977 puerperal women, were analyzed.

"Meaning gained versus meaning lost: The effects of meaning salience on anxiety and depression during the coronavirus pandemic","People who have meaningful lives generally experience less anxiety and depression. Meaning salience, or the awareness of the meaning in one's life, is believed to partially explain this relationship. However, in times of isolation, what might be most salient to people are the meaningful aspects of their lives that have disappeared. This study seeks to understand how making gained versus lost meaning salient affects anxiety and depression. Participants either wrote for 5Ã‚Â minutes about how their life gained meaning (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 29) or lost meaning (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30) due to the coronavirus restrictions, or about music (i.e., the control condition; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 32). Those who wrote about gained meaning experienced less momentary anxiety than those who wrote about lost meaning. In addition, meaning salience moderated the relationship between meaning and both anxiety and depression. Those who wrote about gained meaning appeared to exhibit a positive relationship between meaning in life (MIL) and both anxiety and depression, while those who wrote about lost meaning exhibited negative relationships. In all, this suggests that meaning salience is not always positive and that researchers and practitioners should consider how making positive meaning salient may be more beneficial than a general focus on MIL.","Klussman, Nichols, Langer","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12788","20210617","Anxiety; Depression; Meaning in life; Meaning salience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15252,""
"Emotional effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on oral surgery procedures: a social media analysis","This study aimed to analyze Twitter users' emotional tendencies regarding oral surgery procedures before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. Tweets posted in English before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study.

In 2020, another search was conducted by adding the words &quot;COVID&quot; and &quot;corona&quot; to the abovementioned keywords. Emotions underlying the tweets were analyzed using CrystalFeel - Multidimensional Emotion Analysis. In this analysis, we focused on four emotions: fear, anger, sadness, and joy. A total of 1240 tweets, which were posted before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed. There was a statistically significant difference between the emotions' distribution before and after the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001). While the sense of joy decreased after the pandemic, anger and fear increased. There was a statistically significant difference between the emotional valence distributions before and after the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001). While a negative emotion intensity was noted in 52.9% of the messages before the pandemic, it was observed in 74.3% of the messages after the pandemic. A positive emotional intensity was observed in 29.8% of the messages before the pandemic, but was seen in 10.7% of the messages after the pandemic.

"The COSMO-Spain Survey: Three First Rounds of the WHO Behavioral Insights Tool","<b>Objective:</b> To describe changes in knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices (KAP), risk perception, and psychological variables of Spanish population toward the COVID-19 pandemic from July to November 2020. <b>Methods:</b> Three samples, each of one composed by 1,000+ persons aged 18 years or older, were interviewed online in three rounds, every 2 months, from July to November 2020. <b>Results:</b> The level of knowledge on COVID-19 was high in the three rounds, with percentages above 95% of correct answers related to ways of contagion and correct use of face masks. The most accepted measure was the mandatory use of face masks (80-86% of agreement in the three rounds, <i>p</i> = 0.001), followed by the night curfew (63% of agreement). Most participants (&gt;80%) consistently reported using face masks, ventilating spaces, and washing or disinfecting hands. However, risk perception and self-efficacy were low.

"Influence of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity in children: A scoping review of the literature","There is an urgent concern about physical inactivity among children caused by recent restrictions for containing the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This scoping review aims to identify the impact of the pandemic and related factors on children's physical activity (PA). Twenty-one studies published in 2020 that evaluated PA among children under the age of 18 were extracted from electronic databases. The survey contexts, samples, PA measurement methods, and main findings of each study were categorized and summarized. The review yielded the following results: 1) the PA of children and adolescents mostly decreased; 2) the decrease in PA was more prevalent in boys and older children and adolescents; 3) the decrease in PA was less prevalent in children who live in detached houses, houses with more space, rural areas, and with more family members; and 4) parental support and consideration of location and activity types may help children maintain or increase their PA during the pandemic. This review shows a decline in PA among children and raises concerns about the pandemic's impact on physical and mental health. Declines in PA appear greater among children who participate in organized team sports and those with limited space and opportunity for habitual PA at home or in their neighborhood. Public support for children and families should consider these findings to prevent the negative effects of physical inactivity.","Yomoda, Kurita","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesf.2021.04.002","20210619","COVID-19; Child health; Exercise; Scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15255,""
"Acute Stress Response Profiles in Health Workers Facing SARS-CoV-2","The study is an explorative investigation aimed to assess the differences in acute stress response patterns of health workers facing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during Italy's first lockdown. A cross-sectional investigation using convenience sampling method was conducted in Italy during April 2020. Eight hundred fifty-eight health workers participated in the research filling out self-report measures including Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Moderate/severe depression was found in 28.9% (95% CI, 25.8-32.04), moderate/severe anxiety in 55.4% (95% CI, 51.9-58.8), insomnia in 15% (95% CI, 12.5-17.5), and distress in 52.5% (95% CI, 48.5%-56.6) of participants. The 3% of health workers reported frequent suicidal thoughts. Female sex, working for &gt;15 h/week in a COVID-19 unit, and living apart from family were associated with a significantly higher risk of distress, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and functional impairment. Four profiles were identified on the basis of psychopathological measures: Profile_0 included 44% (<i>N</i> = 270); Profile_1, 25.6% (<i>N</i> = 157); Profile_2, 19.1% (<i>N</i> = 117); and Profile_3, 11.3% (<i>N</i> = 69) of participants. Results showed a significant effect for Profiles X IES-R (ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> = 0.079; <i>f</i> = 0.29), indicating that in all profiles, except for Profile_0, avoidance scale is lower than hyperarousal and intrusion symptoms scales of the IES-R. This characteristic could be a probable index of the control exerted by the responders to not fly away from their job. The identification of specific profiles could help psychiatrists and emergency psychologists to build specific interventions in terms of both primary and secondary prevention to face future waves of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Moderato, Lazzeroni, Oppo, Dell'Orco, Moderato, Presti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660156","20210619","COVID-19; Italy; PTSD profiles; SARS-CoV-2; descriptive survey study; distress symptoms; health workers; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15256,""
"Design and Validation of Augmented Reality Stimuli for the Treatment of Cleaning Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder","Fear to contamination is an easy-to-provoke, intense, hard-to-control, and extraordinarily persistent fear. A worsening of preexisting psychiatric disorders was observed during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, and several studies suggest that those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be more affected than any other group of people. In the face of worsening OCD symptoms, there is a need for mental health professionals to provide the support needed not only to treat patients who still report symptoms, but also to improve relapse prevention. In this line, it is recommended to improve alternative strategies such as online consultations and digital psychiatry. The aim of this study is to develop augmented reality (AR) stimuli that are clinically relevant for patients with cleaning OCD and assess their efficiency to obtain emotionally significant responses. Four AR stimuli were developed: a plastic bag full of garbage, a piece of bread with mold, a dirty sports shoe, and a piece of rotten meat. All stimuli were shown to a clinical group (17 patients with cleaning OCD) and a control group (11 patients without OCD). Relevant results were the design of the AR stimuli. These stimuli were validated with the statistical difference in perceived anxiety in the meat stimuli between the clinical and control groups. Nevertheless, when looking at effect sizes, all stimuli present effect sizes from small (plastic bag) to large (meat), with both shoe and bread between small and medium effect sizes. These results are a valuable support for the clinical use of these AR stimuli in the treatment of cleaning OCD.","GarcÃƒÂ­a-Batista, Guerra-PeÃƒÂ±a, Alsina-Jurnet, Cano-Vindel, Cantisano-GuzmÃƒÂ¡n, Nazir-Ferreiras, Moretti, Medrano, Garrido","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.618874","20210619","anxiety; augmented reality; e-health; emotion; obsessive compulsive disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15257,""
"Metacognitive Therapy for Work-Related Stress: A Feasibility Study","About 25% of EU workers experience work-related stress for all or most of their working time, showing that work-related stress is a major cause of health problems for the EU population. This situation has been worsened even more by the COVID-19 restrictions embraced by employers worldwide. However, a timely and sustainable intervention protocol for treating such issues has not been developed yet. Thus, the present research shows a first effective attempt based on Metacognitive therapy (MCT) to solve this issue. MCT was practiced on four individuals suffering from chronic work-related stress. Primary outcome variables were general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure. Participants were assessed at multiple baselines before the start of therapy and then attended a 3- and 6-months follow-up after treatment termination. Results showed significant improvements in general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure in each client. Secondary outcome variables improved too-maladaptive coping strategies, avoidance behaviors, and depression symptoms-corroborating the main findings. At 3- and 6-month follow-up, results were maintained. The findings suggest that MCT might be a promising and sustainable intervention for work-related stress, although a metacognitive model for stress and large-scale RCTs need to be developed and carried out to further explore the effect of MCT on stress. Our results represent one of the first attempts to treat work-related stress via Metacognitive Therapy and support the feasibility of the treatment, both in terms of its efficacy and sustainability, in a historical moment in which work-related stress is increased worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within such a realm, our feasibility study should be followed by larger and controlled studies that, if successful, would provide various stakeholders-including organizational and institutional decision-makers-with a solid, timely and cost-effective method to help the workforce coping with work-related stress.","De Dominicis, Troen, Callesen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.668245","20210619","COVIDÃ¢Ë†â€™19; anxiety; blood pressure; depression; metacognitive therapy; work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15258,""
"Mental Health Support in the Time of Crisis: Are We Prepared? Experiences With the COVID-19 Counselling Programme in Hungary","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) posed unexpected global economic and societal challenges. These include a heavy impact on mental health due to fast changing lockdown and quarantine measures, uncertainty about health and safety and the prospect of new waves of infections. To provide crisis mental health support during the pandemic, EÃƒÂ¶tvÃƒÂ¶s LorÃƒÂ¡nd University in Hungary launched a specialist online counselling programme, consisting of one to three sessions. The programme was available to all university members between 4th March and 25th May 2020. Overall, 47 clients received support. In this paper we discuss challenges reported by clients, key features of providing a brief mental health intervention online, reflect on counsellor experiences and give recommendations on how mental health services could be developed in the time of crisis. Most clients had challenges with developing a daily routine under quarantine; and many had hardship related to finances, housing, and distance learning. Common mental health consequences included fear from the virus and stress, anxiety, and fatigue due to the interruption to everyday life. In some cases, more complex conditions were triggered by the pandemic. Examples include addictive behaviours and symptoms of depression or psychosis. However, referring cases beyond the competency of counselling proved to be a challenge due to the closure of specialist services. Counsellors observed three key features to the online delivery of a brief crisis mental health intervention: [1] an explicit problem-oriented approach to counselling; [2] challenges of building rapport online; and [3] frames of online counselling. Counsellor experiences often overlapped with those of clients and included challenges of working from home and adjusting to online counselling methods. The possibility of online counselling allowed that mental health care could take place at all during the pandemic. Client experiences reflect findings from previous literature. Like other mental health initiatives launched to tackle COVID-19, the intervention's effectiveness was not measured given the unexpected context and short time frame for programme development. We recommend the use of impact measurement tools to develop mental health services in crises. Meanwhile, the pandemic brought to attention the need to better understand online delivery models. Counsellors should have access to training opportunities on online counselling and managing work-life balance in a remote setting. The COVID-19 counselling programme in EÃƒÂ¶tvÃƒÂ¶s LorÃƒÂ¡nd University, Hungary is an example of providing online mental health counselling in the time of crisis. Clearly, more studies are needed discussing delivery models and effectiveness of mental health interventions during the pandemic. Experience and knowledge sharing across practitioners should be encouraged to improve how the field reacts to unexpected, high risk events and crises.","Szlamka, Kiss, BernÃƒÂ¡th, KÃƒÂ¡mÃƒÂ¡n, Lubani, Karner, Demetrovics","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.655211","20210619","COVID-19; brief intervention; counselling; crisis mental health; online counselling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15259,""
"Mothers' daily perceived stress influences their children's mental health during SARS-CoV-2-pandemic-an online survey","The current situation caused by the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic is associated with serious losses for everyone and has been affecting social life, politics, the economy and the media worldwide. Preventive isolation and social distancing strategies have confronted families with a large number of different challenges. The current epidemic and quarantine restrictions have a verifiable influence on the emotional and social development of children and adolescents. During this ongoing situation children of parents, who already were mentally stressed, seem particularly at risk. We aimed to assess the role of maternal daily perceived stress on children's mental health during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. An online &quot;SARS-CoV-2-pandemic survey&quot; was developed to assess children's mental health since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To describe maternal perceived everyday stress, data from a longitudinal survey was utilized. Our survey includes elements and versions of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale. We furthermore collected socio-demographic data. Due to our limited dependent variables we applied Tobit models for estimation. We found a positive and significant effect of the maternal perceived everyday stress on children's emotional problems during the pandemic. Furthermore, results provide empirical evidence for an increase of the children's hyperactivity level dependent on the mother's perceived stress before the SARS-COV-2 crisis. We could not find significant effects for the relationship between mother's perceived everyday stress and the children's behavioral problems. Analyses illustrate the effects on children's mental distress during everyday life in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Future research needs to identify influencing factors with regard to political, economic and social restrictions, in order to prevent children's mental health problems.","KÃƒÂ¶hler-Dauner, Clemens, Lange, Ziegenhain, Fegert","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00385-3","20210617","Emotional and social development of children and adolescents; Life quality; Mental stress; Psychosocial impact; SARS-CoV-2-pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15260,""
"Tipping the scales: a theoretical model to describe the differential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in almost every aspect of life. The fatal consequences of the pandemic have been clearly reported, with direct and indirect effects; however, there is some evidence of a positive secondary impact, such as fewer motor accidents, lower influenza burden and reduced air pollution. We present a model to describe the differing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality, taking into account external pressures and internal resources and their relationship with resilience and health behaviors, which affect mortality risk, inspired by elements of the salutogenic model. Individuals with lower resources and from more deprived communities are likely to be more negatively affected by the external changes occurring, while those with more resources may be more likely to experience the benefits. Both individual and community resources affect coping and influence both mental and physical health. Decision makers should consider ways to incorporate the positive changes which occurred as part of the exit strategy. Societies should invest in building resources to improve both individual and community resilience to help people be better prepared and more able to cope and adapt in times of crisis. Special emphasis should be given to weaker populations most affected by external changes, including older people, low socioeconomic groups, those with mental health issues and minority groups, in order to reduce disparities.","Saban, Myers, Luxenburg, Wilf-Miron","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01470-x","20210617","Covid-19; Health behavior; Model; Morality; Pandemic; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15261,""

"The presence of headache at onset in SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with long-term post-COVID headache and fatigue: A case-control study","To investigate the association of headache during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection with long-term post-COVID headache and other post-COVID symptoms in hospitalised survivors. A case-control study including patients hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain was conducted. Patients reporting headache as a symptom during the acute phase and age- and sex-matched patients without headache during the acute phase participated. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview 7 months after hospital discharge. Participants were asked about a list of post-COVID symptoms and were also invited to report any additional symptom they might have. Anxiety/depressive symptoms and sleep quality were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Overall, 205 patients reporting headache and 410 patients without headache at hospitalisation were assessed 7.3 months (Standard Deviation 0.6) after hospital discharge. Patients with headache at onset presented a higher number of post-COVID symptoms (Incident Rate Ratio: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.03-1.30). Headache at onset was associated with a previous history of migraine (Odd Ratio: 2.90, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.41-5.98) and with the development of persistent tension-type like headache as a new post-COVID symptom (Odd Ratio: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.66-4.24). Fatigue as a long-term symptom was also more prevalent in patients with headache at onset (Odd Ratio: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.07-2.24). No between-group differences in the prevalence of anxiety/depressive symptoms or sleep quality were seen. Headache in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with higher prevalence of headache and fatigue as long-term post-COVID symptoms.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychiatric Emergency Service Volume and Hospital Admissions","During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been an increasing number of emergency department visits for behavioral health reasons, even as overall emergency department volumes have decreased. The impact of the pandemic and related public health interventions on specialized psychiatric emergency services has not been described. These services provide high-intensity care for severely ill patients who are likely to be homeless and underserved. We describe the change in total volume and psychiatric hospitalization rates among three psychiatric emergency services across the United States. Changes in volumes and hospitalization were assessed for statistical significance using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors model from January 2018 to DecemberÃ‚Â 2020. The pandemic's impact on volumes and hospitalization varied by site. In Denver (CO), there was a statistically significant 9% decrease in overall volumes, although an 18% increase in hospitalizations was not significant. In New York City (NY), there was a significant 7% decrease in volumes as well as a significant 6% decrease in hospitalizations. In Portland (OR), volumes decreased by 4% and hospitalizations increased by 6% although differences did not reach statistical significance. There has been a decrease in volume at these services after the pandemic, but there are substantial variations in the magnitude of change and demand for hospitalization by region. These findings suggest a need to understand where patients in crisis are seeking care and how systems of care must adapt to changing utilization in the pandemic era.","Simpson, Loh, Cabrera, Cahn, Gross, Hadley, Lawrence","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2021.05.005","20210618","COVID-19; community mental health; emergency psychiatry; health services; psychiatric emergency services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15265,""

"First description of natural concomitant infection of avian nephritis virus and infectious bronchitis virus reveals exacerbated inflammatory response and renal damage in broiler chicks","We describe the first report on spontaneous Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV) and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) concurrent infection in broiler chicks. On necropsy, the kidneys were found swollen with its parenchyma and ureters stuffed with urate flakes. Histopathologically, the renal tubular damage and inflammatory response were severe in concurrently infected birds compared to the cases infected only with ANV, which had direct correlation with significantly (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) increased expression of IL-1 ÃŽÂ², IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, iNOS and IFN-ÃŽÂ³ transcripts in the kidneys of concurrently infected birds. Relative decrease in IFN-ÃŽÂ² transcript levels in the concurrently infected birds indicates suppression of antiviral response; the iNOS level was manifold increased which can be attributed to the enhanced macrophage response. Nucleotide sequencing of S1-spike glycoprotein gene of IBV and RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene of ANV confirmed etiologies as Igacovirus of Gammacoronavirus and ANV-2 of Avastrovirus 2, respectively. Both ANV and IBV virus affect kidneys. Our findings suggested that concurrent infections of these two viruses might have enhanced the transcripts of Th1, Th2 and proinflammatory cytokines with reduced IFN-ÃŽÂ² transcripts resulting in decreased host innate antiviral mechanisms leading to exacerbated renal lesions. Future experimental co-infection studies could throw more lights on pathology and pathogenesis during concurrent infections of ANV and IBV in poultry.","Munuswamy, Ramakrishnan, Latheef, Kappala, Mariappan, Kaore, Anbazhagan, Puvvala, Singh, Dhama","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104830","20210617","Avian nephritis virus; Cytokines; Infectious bronchitis virus; Inflammation; Pathology; Animals; Avastrovirus; Chickens; Coronavirus Infections; Infectious bronchitis virus; Kidney; Poultry Diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","",15268,""
