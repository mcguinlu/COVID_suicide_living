"Network analysis of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and depression in adolescents across COVID-19 epidemic and Typhoon Lekima","Network analytic studies indicate that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be comorbid with depression at the symptom level, but it remains unclear whether these findings are replicable and generalizable across trauma types. This study aim was to examine and compare PTSD-depression comorbidity networks of two types of trauma related to Typhoon Lekima and COVID-19 epidemic. Participants were 1605 and 601 adolescents recruited following Typhoon Lekima and the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. COVID-19 and Lekima PTSD-depression networks had considerable similarities, including adequate stability and accuracy, connected symptoms of PTSD and depression, symptoms with high centralities, and bridge symptoms. PTSD-depression comorbid symptoms were more complicated in the COVID-19 network but may show more persistence in the Lekima network. Distinct bridge symptoms contributed to the heterogeneity of PTSD-depression comorbidity characteristics between the two networks. Specifically, restricted affect and felt down and unhappy were two important bridge symptoms with high centrality unique to the COVID-19 network. PTSD-depression comorbidity network has considerable replicability across trauma types, but specific symptom-level associations and some bridge symptoms may vary across trauma types. These findings also highlight the importance of negative emotions to comorbid PTSD and depression in adolescents following the COVID-19 outbreak compared with Typhoon Lekima.","Qi, Sun, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.080","20210911","COVID-19; Depression: Network analysis; PTSD; Typhoon lekima","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","",17882,""
"Insomnia, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: an international collaborative study","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented changes in social, work, and leisure activities, which all have had major impact on sleep and psychological well-being. This study documented the prevalence of clinical cases of insomnia, anxiety, and depression and selected risk factors (COVID-19, confinement, financial burden, social isolation) during the first wave of the pandemic in 13 countries throughout the world. International, multi-center, harmonized survey of 22Ã‚Â 330 adults (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 41.9 years old, range 18-95; 65.6% women) from the general population in 13 countries and four continents. Participants were invited to complete a standardized web-based survey about sleep and psychological symptoms during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from May to August 2020. Clinical insomnia symptoms were reported by 36.7% (95% CI, 36.0-37.4) of respondents and 17.4% (95% CI, 16.9-17.9) met criteria for a probable insomnia disorder. There were 25.6% (95% CI, 25.0-26.2) with probable anxiety and 23.1% (95% CI, 22.5-23.6) with probable depression. Rates of insomnia symptoms (&gt;40%) and insomnia disorder (&gt;25%) were significantly higher in women, younger age groups, and in residents of Brazil, Canada, Norway, Poland, USA, and United Kingdom compared to residents from Asian countries (China and Japan, 8% for disorder and 22%-25% for symptoms) (all PsÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01). Proportions of insomnia cases were significantly higher among participants who completed the survey earlier in the first wave of the pandemic relative to those who completed it later. Risks of insomnia were higher among participants who reported having had COVID-19, who reported greater financial burden, were in confinement for a period of four to five weeks, and living alone or with more than five people in same household. These associations remained significant after controlling for age, sex, and psychological symptoms. Insomnia, anxiety, and depression were very prevalent during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health prevention programs are needed to prevent chronicity and reduce long-term adverse outcomes associated with chronic insomnia and mental health problems.","Morin, Bjorvatn, Chung, Holzinger, Partinen, Penzel, Ivers, Wing, Chan, Merikanto, Mota-Rolim, MacÃƒÂªdo, De Gennaro, LÃƒÂ©ger, Dauvilliers, Plazzi, Nadorff, Bolstad, Sieminski, Benedict, Cedernaes, Inoue, Han, Espie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.07.035","20210911","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Insomnia; Pandemic; Sleep problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","",17883,""
"COVID-19 Reinfection in a Young Medical Doctor: A Case Report","There is hardly any report of reinfection due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in medical professionals from Nepal. We report a case of a 32-year-old doctor with COVID-19 reinfection. Symptoms during the first infection were mild. After one month, he was reinfected and developed diarrhea as well as a continuous high fever. His d-dimer and ferritin were much increased. Computed tomography chest showed bilateral lymph nodes, minimal pleural effusion, and scattered linear fibrosis. After discharge, his depression and myalgia persisted for one month. During reinfection, his symptoms were more severe and cost of treatment was almost eight times his monthly salary and he could not work for six weeks. Possible reasons for severe reinfection and differential diagnoses like cytokine storm, multisystem inÃ¯Â¬â€šammatory syndrome, reactivation of COVID-19, and infection due to new variants were discussed. Whether infected or vaccinated or not, all should take recommended vaccination and primary-preventive as well as health-promotive measures.","Gaire, Sah, Singh","https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.6450","20210911","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","",17884,""
"COVID-19 and mental health of individuals with different personalities","Several studies have been devoted to establishing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health across gender, age, and ethnicity. However, much less attention has been paid to the differential effect of COVID-19 according to different personalities. We do this using the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), a large-scale panel survey representative of the UK population. The UKHLS allows us to assess the mental health of the same respondent before and during the COVID-19 period based on their ""Big Five"" personality traits and cognitive skills. We find that during the COVID-19 period, individuals who have more extravert and open personality traits report a higher mental health deterioration, while those scoring higher in agreeableness are less affected. The effect of openness is particularly strong: One more SD predicts up to 0.23 more symptoms of mental health deterioration in the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) test during the COVID-19 period. In particular, for females, cognitive skills and openness are strong predictors of mental health deterioration, while for non-British White respondents, these predictors are extraversion and openness. Neuroticism strongly predicts worse mental health cross-sectionally, but it does not lead to significantly stronger deterioration during the pandemic. The study's results are robust to the inclusion of potential confounding variables such as changes in physical health, household income, and job status (like unemployed or furloughed).","Proto, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2109282118","20210911","Big Five; COVID-19; cognitive skills; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","",17885,""
"Peritoneal dialysis patients - the forgotten group in the coronavirus pandemic","While all patients with chronic disease have undoubtedly been affected by the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, individuals with end-stage renal failure have suffered significant excess morbidity and mortality. Patients on haemodialysis have received extensive research and media attention into their vulnerability to the disease; however, those receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) have been much less visible. We surveyed a selection of patients from a cohort receiving PD at a tertiary renal unit in Birmingham, UK. We devised a questionnaire looking at patients' experience of shielding, accessing both dialysis and general medical care during the pandemic, and their thoughts about the pandemic and the future. Concerning findings were apparent from this. Attending hospital was the most commonly cited reason for being unable to shield, and multiple patients experienced difficulties accessing care while unwell during this period. Worryingly, 58% of respondents indicated that they feel negatively, or feel ambivalent, about the future. Patients receiving PD have suffered significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic and face ongoing difficulties and risks while accessing medical care. It is vital that this cohort is not forgotten in the planning of renal services during the pandemic, and that special attention is paid to both their physical and mental health.","Balson, Baharani","https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2021-0259","20210911","COVID-19; coronavirus; dialysis; patient experience; peritoneal dialysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","",17886,""
"Foundation doctors' perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lessons for the future","The foundation programme is a 2-year training programme for newly qualified doctors and aims to bridge the gap between medical school and specialty training. The pandemic led to some major disruptions to foundation training. As foundation trainees, we encountered new challenges: there were reduced learning opportunities and our future paths became uncertain with changes to specialty training applications and membership exams. However, it is said that every crisis creates new opportunities and is a test of our resilience and innovativeness. There was the adoption of novel teaching methods, new research opportunities, increased importance given to teamwork and support for our wellbeing and mental health. We learnt lessons from this crisis that we should take forward to improve foundation training for the future.","Kotta, Elango, Matcha, Chow","https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2021-0244","20210911","career planning; education; foundation training; training; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","",17887,""
"Relationships between physical activity, social isolation, and depression among older adults during COVID-19: A path analysis","There are known significant relationships between greater physical activity and less depression, and greater social isolation and greater depression; therefore, it is important to understand these relationships among older adults during COVID-19. The Physical Activity Scale for Elders, Geriatric Depression Scale, and PROMIS Social Isolation were administered. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between physical activity, social isolation, and depression. Of 803 surveys received, Consistent with our a-priori model, higher social isolation predicted greater depression. (p&lt;0.001).

"The effect of COVID-19 on mental well-being in Switzerland: a cross-sectional survey of the adult Swiss general population","In addition to the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic to physical health, mental health is challenged by the emotional response to the situation and the official measures taken to stop the pandemic. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of impaired mental well-being due to COVID-19 and explore associated factors. The study was an observational, population-based, nationwide, cross-sectional online survey of a representative sample of the general Swiss population performed between March and April 2020. Participants reported on mental well-being, self-isolation/quarantine, their risk for developing severe COVID-19, and their work situation. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed risk factors for impaired mental well-being due to the pandemic. Data from 1022 individuals were analysed. The median age was 44Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (range 18 to 78) and 49% were women. A third of respondents reported that the COVID-19 pandemic impaired their mental well-being and almost half reported specific mental health concerns. Impaired mental well-being was associated with having health problems (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.88, 95% CI: 1.29-2.74, vs no problems), being or living with someone at risk for severe COVID-19 (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.38, 95% CI: 1-1.9,), smoking (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.8, 95% CI: 1.24-2.61), living in urban residential environments (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.62, 95% CI: 1.13-2.32, vs rural), not being able to work due to closed workplace (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.66, 95% CI: 1.04-2.67), aged between 18 and 29Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.99, 95% CI: 1.32-3.01, vs 45 to 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old), and living in a single household (living with someone, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.65, 95% CI: 0.44-0.97,vs single household). Overall, the most significant covariates of impaired mental well-being were specific mental health concerns: feeling depressed (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.21, 95% CI: 4.5-11.55), feeling less pleasure in doing things than before (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.28, 95% CI: 4.1-9.62), feeling anxious (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.13, 95% CI: 3.91-9.59) and feeling lonely (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.08, 95% CI: 2.53-6.58). Impaired mental well-being can carry long-term consequences. We encourage policymakers to implement strategies to promote mental health during this pandemic situation. Special attention should be addressed to the youngest, those at risk for severe COVID-19 and those with government-imposed work restrictions.","Diaz Hernandez, Giezendanner, Fischer, Zeller","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01532-7","20210911","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Outbreak; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","",17889,""
