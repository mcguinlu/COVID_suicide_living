"The impact of changes in mental health services in response to COVID-19 on people with mental health conditions: protocol for a rapid review","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to mental health services, forcing the rapid implementation of alternative ways of delivering services alongside a greater immediate, and continuously growing, demand across those services. The care and level of mental health service provided are felt to be inadequate to respond to the increasing demand for mental health conditions in the time of the pandemic, leading to an urgent need to learn from service change and consequences to inform solutions and plans to support the NHS post-pandemic plan in the UK. This rapid review aims to understand the changes in mental health services during the pandemic and summarise the impact of these changes on the health outcomes of people with mental health conditions. Methods and analysis Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfowill be searched for eligible studies with key terms indicating mental health AND COVID-19 AND health services. Studies will be included if objective and subjective effects of changes to mental health services in response to COVID-19 are reported on adults with mental health conditions, peer-reviewed and published in the English language. Study selection and data extraction will be undertaken dependently by two reviewers. Evidence will be summarised narratively and in a logic model. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required for this review. A list of interventions/services/models of care delivered to people with mental health conditions will be grouped as ""Do"", ""Don't"" and ""Don't know"" based on the evidence on effectiveness and acceptability. The results will be written for publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal and disseminated to the public and patients, clinicians, commissioners, funders, and academic conferences.

"COVID-19 and the HIV continuum in people living with HIV enrolled in Collaborating Consortium of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities (C3PNO) cohorts","Background The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the normal delivery of HIV care, altered social support networks, and caused economic insecurity. People with HIV (PWH) are vulnerable to such disruptions, particularly if they have a history of substance use. We describe engagement in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for PWH during the pandemic. Methods From May 2020 to February 2021, 773 PWH enrolled in 6 existing cohorts completed 1495 surveys about substance use and engagement in HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We described the prevalence and correlates of having missed a visit with an HIV provider in the past month and having missed a dose of ART in the past week. Results Thirteen percent of people missed an HIV visit in the past month. Missing a visit was associated with unstable housing, food insecurity, anxiety, low resiliency, disruptions to mental health care, and substance use including cigarette smoking, hazardous alcohol use, cocaine, and cannabis use. Nineteen percent of people reported missing at least one dose of ART in the week prior to their survey. Missing a dose of ART was associated with being a man, low resiliency, disruptions to mental health care, cigarette smoking, hazardous alcohol use, cocaine, and cannabis use, and experiencing disruptions to substance use treatment. Conclusions Social determinants of health, substance use, and disruptions to mental health and substance use treatment were associated with poorer engagement in HIV care. Close attention to continuity of care during times of social disruption is especially critical for PWH.","Lesko, Catherine R.; Keruly, Jeanne C.; Moore, Richard D.; Shen, Nicola M.; Pytell, Jarratt D.; Lau, Bryan, Fojo, Anthony T.; Mehta, Shruti H.; Kipke, Michele, Baum, Marianna K.; Shoptaw, Steven, Gorbach, Pamina M.; Mustanski, Brian, Javanbakht, Marjan, Siminski, Suzanne, Chander, Geetanjali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109355","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109355, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27018,""
"Bereft and Left: The interplay between insecure attachment, isolation, and neurobiology","Being isolated from a group is associated with health risks, depressive symptomology, and increased risk-taking behaviors. A growing body of literature suggests that the way individual experiences isolation is a moderator of these negative health risks. How an individual perceives loneliness may be a product of oneâ€™s social environment: namely, an individualâ€™s attachment style may indicate the extent to which he or she experiences feelings of loneliness. This is particularly relevant in the recent climate of social isolation due to COVID-19 restrictions and future pandemic response. The goal of this paper is to review and consolidate research in the domains of both loneliness and attachment and demonstrate how the two cyclically affect one another. We review the literature from a neurobiological point of view to explore the underlying bidirectional relationships between an individualâ€™s genetics, neuroendocrine system, and neuroanatomy, and an individualâ€™s attachment style with their primary caregiver. By examining animal models of loneliness and attachment we can see the behavioral and biological similarities between humans and animals, highlighting the importance of these types of studies. Finally, we summarize the current research and propose that the underlying biological systems of loneliness and attachment represent bidirectional, multigenerational, gene-environment interactions.","Bell, Kevin, McMillin, Keegan, Ethridge, Lauren E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2022.101020","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Developmental Review; 64:101020, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27019,""

"On top of that all, now Covid-19, too A scoping review of specificities and correlates of fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients during COVID-19","Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a normal response in cancer survivors and one of the most prevalent reactions reported by up to 87% of them. However, elevated levels of FCR impair well-being, quality of life and professional functioning, and lead to anxiety, depression or PTSD. COVID-19 pandemic can exacerbate FCR symptoms, given the restricting access to follow-up investigations and treatment, the isolation restrictions imposed and the possibility of the medical system becoming overworked. This scoping review's objective was to synthesize the literature investigating the factors associated with higher levels of FCR in cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus was on FCR in breast cancer patients, including most of the studies (5 out of 9) on this topic. However, given the novelty of the subject, the increased interest in it, and the fact that there are few studies in this field, the review included 4 other studies with mixed samples of patients with breast cancer and other oncological pathologies. Following rigorous methodological criteria, 9 studies with quantitative or mixed methodology were included (NÂ =Â 4831 patients). The results indicate that high levels of FCR are associated with distress and concerns regarding the pandemic impact, with most common concerns of patients being changes in treatment plan (delays and interruptions), dysfunctional communication with medical staff or difficult access to food or medicine. The most common correlates of FCR during the pandemic are marital status, childlessness, low financial status, level of education, type of cancer diagnosis, generalized anxiety and depression.","Ã‰va, KÃ¡llay, Medrea, Flavia, Csaba, DÃ©gi LÃ¡szlÃ³","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.breast.2022.02.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Breast;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27021,""
"Artificial intelligence and Psychiatry: An overview","The burden of mental illness both in world and India is increasing at an alarming rate. Adding to it, there has been an increase in mental health challenges during covid-19 pandemic with a rise in suicide, loneliness and substance use. Artificial intelligence can act as a potential solution to address this shortage. The use of artificial intelligence is increasingly being employed in various fields of mental health like affective disorders, psychosis, and geriatric psychiatry. The benefits are various like lower costs, wider reach but at the same time it comes with its own disadvantages. This article reviews the current understanding of artificial intelligence, the types of Artificial intelligence, its current use in various mental health disorders, current status in India, advantages, disadvantages and future potentials. With the passage of time and digitalization of the modern age, there will be an increase in the use of artificial intelligence in psychiatry hence a detailed understanding will be thoughtful. For this, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, China national Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Globus Index Medicus search engines by using keywords. Initial searches involved the use of each individual keyword while the later searches involved the use of more than one word in different permutation combinations.","Ray, Adwitiya, Bhardwaj, Akansha, Malik, Yogender Kumar, Singh, Shipra, Gupta, Rajiv","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103021","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 103021, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27022,""
"RESEARCH ON COLLEGE STUDENTS' PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS CAUSED BY EMERGENT CAMPUS CRISIS AND INTERVENTION MEASURES","Background: In colleges and universities, it is not uncommon for college students to experience psychological crises caused by emergent crisis events. These emergent crises always impose direct and serious adverse effects on college students' daily study, normal life, and their mental health as well. At the same time, emergent crisis events may also cause other negative effects. Subjects and methods: This paper takes the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic as an example to study the conditions of college students' psychological stress and corresponding intervention effects through a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire selects college students over 18 years old in Henan Province. A total of 4,000 questionnaires are distributed and 3,396 valid questionnaires are retrieved. SPSS analysis tools are used for data processing. According to the questionnaire results, 20 are selected as the experimental group among the subjects with a factor score = 3, and another 20 as the control group. The experimental group is subjected to a one-month active intervention from the school. The control group did not receive any intervention. SCL-90 scale data of the two groups are tested and recorded respectively before and after the experiment. T test is performed on the paired sample using SPSS software. Results: Among the symptoms on the scale, two most serious problems are depression and anxiety. Students with a depression factor score greater than 2 account for 10.11%, and students with an anxiety factor score greater than 2 account for 13.89%. After the experimental group receive a one-month active intervention, all factor scores decline on difference levels, among which the decline of personal relationship and psychological terror is most significant. Conclusions: Intervention measures such as ideological education and psychological counseling from schools have obvious positive guiding effects on college students experiencing emergencies. Colleges and universities shall not only handle the emergent crisis, but also equip themselves with prevention systems.","Wang, L.; Guo, J.

"ANALYSIS AND INTERVENTION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS' MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE POST-EPIDEMIC ERA","Background: The COVID-19 epidemic has had an immeasurable impact on all sectors of society and has led to anxiety, depression, fear and other negative psychological reactions among college students. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate, analyze and intervene in such phenomenon. Subjects and methods: In this study, 2,000 college students from a certain university in Zhejiang province are selected as interviewees. Questionnaires are used to summarize and analyze the psychological problems of this group. Besides, statistical methods are conducted to compare the actual effects of different treatments on college students with psychological diseases, so as to find the most appropriate way to alleviate their symptoms. Results: Statistical analysis shows that the main psychological problems affecting college students during the epidemic are anxiety and depression, which account for far more than other possible psychological symptoms. The results of SCL-90 scale test shows that Physical Exercise has the most significant effect (R = 67), while Painting Therapy has the highest stability (sigma = 11.898), compared with the mainstream psychotherapy. Conclusions: The efficacy and stability of different therapies are different. Therefore, when choosing treatment methods, therapists need to analyze both the validity and stability, and consider whether the therapy is easy to operate into practice. The idea of conducting multiple therapies comprehensively deserves further study.","Li, P. C.; Mei, Y.

"STUDY ON RELIEVING MENTAL STRESS OF QUARANTINED PEOPLE BY INDOOR EXERCISE DURING THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC","Background: During the epidemic, the mental health of quarantined people is seriously affected. Indoor exercise can alleviate peoples' mental problems and promote physical health, making it an excellent choice for quarantined people. In this study, different frequencies, durations and types of indoor exercise have been investigated, to analyze their effectiveness in relieving mental stress of quarantined people, so as to provide a reference on the issue of mental health protection for quarantined people. Subjects and methods: In this study, 500 quarantined people from Hebei province have been selected as subjects. Three experiments have been conducted to analyze the effect of exercise on stress relief for quarantined people. Experiment 1 examined the frequency of exercise;experiment 2 examined the duration of exercise and experiment 3 examined the exercise program. The research tools include the Wenjuanxing (an online questionnaire survey platform), the statistical analysis tool SPSS 27.0, and the Sentiment Self-assessment Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results: The three DASS scores for the isolates, stress and anxiety are the most severe symptoms. In experiment 1, there is no significant difference in relieving mental stress for exercising 3-5 days per week versus 7 days per week. In experiment 2, depression, anxiety and stress decreased significantly before 45-60 min and almost remained unchanged after this period. In experiment 3, the effect of mixed exercise is better than that of a single exercise (P &gt; 0.01). Conclusions: Exercise 3-5 times a week is appropriate. The optimal duration of each exercise session is between 45-60 min, with the effect decreasing in sequence for less than 45 min and not increasing significantly for more than 60 min.","Du, G.; Tao, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=STUDY+ON+RELIEVING+MENTAL+STRESS+OF+QUARANTINED+PEOPLE+BY+INDOOR+EXERCISE+DURING+THE+COVID-19+EPIDEMIC","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatria Danubina; 33:S693-S698, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27025,""

"Immune Response to Vaccination in Adults with Mental Disorders: A Systematic Review","Mental disorders are associated with immune dysregulation as measured by serum levels of biological markers of immunity. Adults with mental disorders have also been reported to have attenuated post vaccine immune response. The COVID-19 pandemic has invited the need to determine whether individuals with mental disorders exhibit differential immune response following the administration of vaccines for other infections. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and PsycInfo was conducted from inception to May 2021 investigating vaccine response in persons with mental disorders, as measured by biological markers of immunity (i.e., antibodies, cytokines). Thirteen articles were identified which evaluated vaccine efficacy in persons with mental disorders. Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) or schizophrenia revealed attenuated immune response to vaccination, or no statistical difference compared to control subjects. Individuals with anorexia nervosa or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) displayed no attenuated post-vaccination antibody level. Individuals with insomnia displayed lower levels of antibodies after vaccination, whereas individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) displayed no difference in vaccine response compared to control subjects. The limitations of this review include the relatively few articles included (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯13) and small sample sizes (less than thirty subjects) in the majority of articles. Vaccine response in adults with a mental disorder remains inconclusive. Notwithstanding the heterogeneity and relatively small number of studies, available evidence does suggest attenuated immune response across disparate vaccinations. Future research is required to confirm vaccine efficacy in persons with mental disorders, especially regarding immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination.","Xiao, Gillissie, Lui, Ceban, Teopiz, Gill, Cao, Ho, Rosenblat, McIntyre","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.025","20220215","COVID-19; depression; immune function; mental illness; mood, disorders; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27028,""

"Burnout and psychological distress among Pakistani nurses providing care to COVID-19 patients: A cross-sectional study","The aim of this study is to assess the burden of burnout and psychological distress and its association among Pakistani nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19. Nurses may experience an elevated risk of burnout and psychological distress during epidemics. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sample of 288 nurses. Maslach Burnout Inventory was administered to measure burnout and its domains of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Screening Tool for Psychological Distress was administered to measure depression, anxiety, stress, anger, and low social support. Burnout was present in 48.6% of nurses, severe emotional exhaustion in 37.2%, severe depersonalization in 36.8%, and low personal accomplishment in 46.9% of nurses. Psychological distress was present in 45% of nurses. Burnout and psychological distress were significantly higher in nurses who: were working in public hospitals, did not receive training for COVID-19 prevention, and were dealing with increased patient load. Burnout and its domains were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, stress, anger, and low social support. Nurses are experiencing high levels of burnout and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic with a significant moderate-to-strong association between these conditions. These findings accentuate the need for institution-based interventions to mitigate burnout and preserve the mental health of nurses. Hospitals must screen nurses frequently for the presence of significant burnout and psychological distress and offer supportive interventions to protect their mental health and well-being.","Andlib, Inayat, Azhar, Aziz","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12750","20220215","COVID-19; burnout; mental health; nurses; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27030,""
"Effects of COVID-19 on Patients in Adult Ambulatory Psychiatry: Using Patient-Rated Outcome Measures and Telemedicine","<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> <i>To examine the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients in an academic psychiatric ambulatory clinic, data from a measurement-based care (MBC) system were analyzed to evaluate impacts on psychiatric functioning in patients using telemedicine. Psychiatric functioning was evaluated for psychological distress (brief adjustment scale [BASE]-6), depression (patient health questionnaire [PHQ]-9), and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder [GAD]-7), including initial alcohol (U.S. alcohol use disorders identification test) and substance use (drug abuse screening test-10) screening.</i> <b><i>Methods:</i></b> <i>This observational study included MBC data collected from November 2019 to March 2021. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) were examined to determine changes in symptomatology over the course of treatment, as well as symptom changes resulting from the pandemic. Patients were included in analyses if they completed at least one PROM in the MBC system.</i> <b><i>Results:</i></b> <i>A total of 2,145 patients actively participated in the MBC system completing at least one PROM, with engagement ranging from 35.07% to 83.50% depending on demographic factors, where completion rates were significantly different for age, payor status, and diagnostic group. Average baseline scores for new patients varied for the GAD-7, PHQ-9, and BASE-6. Within-person improvements in mental health before and after the pandemic were statistically significant for anxiety, depression, and psychological adjustment.</i> <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> <i>MBC is a helpful tool in determining treatment progress for patients engaging in telemedicine. This study showed that patients who engaged in psychiatric services incorporating PROMs had improvements in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Experience of Homebound Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Homebound older adults have heightened risks for isolation and negative health consequences, but it is unclear how COVID-19 has impacted them. We examine social contact and mood symptoms among previously homebound older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a nationally-representative longitudinal study of aging in the USA. A total of 3,112 community-dwelling older adults in 2019 who completed the COVID-19 survey in the summer/fall of 2020. Homebound status was defined via self-report as rarely/never leaving home or leaving the house with difficulty or help in the prior month. We measured limited social contact during COVID-19 (in-person, telephone, video or email contacts &lt;once/week), as well as loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Among homebound older adults, 13.2% experienced limited social contact during COVID-19 vs. 6.5% of the non-homebound. Differences in social contact were greatest for contacts via email/text/social media: 54.9% of the homebound used this &lt;once/week vs. 28.4% of the non-homebound. In adjusted analyses of those without limited social contact prior to the pandemic, the homebound had higher but not significantly different odds (OR 1.83; 95% CI 0.95-3.52) of limited social contact during COVID-19, with increased risk among the older individuals, those with dementia, and those in assisted living facilities. Of the homebound, 13.2% felt lonely every/most days during the pandemic vs. 7.7% of non-homebound older adults. Homebound and non-homebound older adults reported similar rates of increased loneliness, anxiety, or depression during COVID-19. Fewer homebound older adults learned a new technology during the pandemic (16.3%) vs. non-homebound older adults (30.4%). Isolation among homebound older adults increased during COVID-19, partially due to differences in technology use. We must ensure that homebound persons have the connection and care they need including new technologies for communication during and beyond COVID-19.","Ankuda, Kotwal, Reckrey, Harrison, Ornstein","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-07361-9","20220215","COVID-19; Homebound; Isolation; NHATS; Social contact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27032,""
"Perceptions of mental health and need satisfaction/frustration among rural university students","Because of COVID-19, higher education changed as institutions went remote and students' mental health was challenged. Rural universities were disproportionately affected because of limited Internet access. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological need satisfaction/frustration and mental health among rural college students during this pandemic. Six hundred ninety-eight students (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 22.15Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.55) at a rural South-eastern university were recruited. Participants completed a survey examining stress, anxiety, need satisfaction/frustration and previous experience with online courses. Anxiety, autonomy and competence frustration were found to predict 60% of the variance of stress. Another regression analysis found stress, autonomy, competence, and relatedness frustration to predict 70% of the anxiety variance. Students are frustrated due to the lack of control and restrictions affecting their social interaction. Understanding the relationship between need satisfaction/frustration and mental health can aid university administration in developing interventions that address rural students' needs.","Dasinger, Gibson","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2032089","20220215","COVID-19; College students; mental health; rural","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27033,""
"Self-Injurious Behavior Rate in the Short-Term Period of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea","The objective of this study was to investigate the trend of self-injurious behavior (SIB) among persons who were directly impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially those with pre-existing mental disorders. Using the National Health Insurance Service-COVID-19 database cohort, the monthly SIB rate was calculated by COVID-19 subgroups (i.e., positive for COVID-19 test, negative for COVID-19 test, and non-COVID-19 test [control]). In addition, moderated regression analysis was utilized to examine the statistical difference of SIB (suicide attempt and non-suicidal self-injury using ICD-10 code) trend between COVID-19 subgroups and with and without pre-existing mental disorder. A total of 328,373 persons were included in the cohort study. Of these, 212,678 had been tested for COVID-19, and 7,713 of them were confirmed positive. During the pandemic peak, the ""negative for COVID-19"" group showed a large increase (<i>P</i> = 0.003) in SIB rates compared to the control group, the ""positive for COVID-19"" group showed a decreasing trend, but not significant (<i>P</i> = 0.314). Among those who were tested for COVID-19, those with pre-existing mental disorders showed an increasing trend of SIB compared to those without pre-existing mental disorders, however statistically insignificant (<i>P</i> = 0.137). Our results suggest that people who are tested for COVID-19 are at a high risk of SIB during the peak COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, screening for suicide risk and psychological interventions is needed for these high-risk groups.","Park, Rim, Jo, Lee, Kim, Park","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e45","20220215","COVID-19; COVID-19 Positive; Mental Disorders; Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI); Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB); South Korea; Suicide Attempt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27034,""
"Multisectoral actions of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mazandaran province of Iran","A widespread outbreak of COVID-19 is followed by adverse effects on the mental health of the general population. Therefore, this study is an audit to investigate the activities of various organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mazandaran Province, Iran. The aim of the study was to collect the data, the relevant officials in various organizations and units were contacted to collect the statistics of actions taken in psychology and psychiatry wards. Moreover, databases such as Google Scholar and Iranian resources were searched. According to the results, different healthcare systems worked in parallel during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Mazandaran University of Medical Science [MAZUMS] Health Vice-Chancellor performed the following activities during this crisis: establishing a virtual crisis management working group, holding a provincial educational committee to train the crisis management teams, organizing virtual psychological intervention teams in the healthcare systems, and so forth. In addition, the mental health activities by Mazandaran Welfare Organization during the COVID-19 outbreak included providing hostelry free psychological counseling, quarantine boarding and rehabilitation centers, and providing harm prevention protocols of COVID-19, especially for marginalized regions. In the third level of medical centers, including hospitals, consultation-liaison psychiatry or psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, therapeutic interventions for comorbid psychiatric disorders with COVID-19 disease, and online workshops for mental health were conducted to reduce burnout of medical staff and nurses. This study can provide a good guideline for different service providers by using the experiences of other centers to achieve better results.","Ahmadi Livani, Gohardehi, Azizi, Hashemvarzi, Taghavi, Tonekaboni, Golchobi, Zarghami, Aarabi, Elyasi","https://doi.org/10.1002/npr2.12239","20220215","COVID-19; consultation-liaison psychiatry; health vice-chancellor; mental health; welfare organization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27035,""

"Sleep disturbances following recovery from COVID-19: a comparative cross-sectional study in Egypt","Sequelae from COVID-19 are increasingly being reported, but sleep disturbances after recovery from the disease have had little attention. This study aimed to identify and compare sleep disturbances and associated correlates among adults who have recovered from COVID-19 with those who have never been infected with the disease. The sample included 85 adults who have recovered from COVID-19 and 85 adults who have never been infected (matched on age, sex, education and socioeconomic level). Individuals were recruited from Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt from 1 September to 29 November 2020. Participants were interviewed using a sociodemographic and clinical checklist, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Most (77%) of the recovered cases had experienced sleep disturbances, compared with 46% of controls. Individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 were more likely to have poor subjective sleep quality (odds ratio (OR) 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-2.1), prolonged sleep latency (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.6), shorter sleep duration (OR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.2), reduced sleep efficiency (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 2.0-7.1), frequent daytime dysfunction (OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3.1) and poor global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.5-6.0). Depressive (P = 0.002) and anxiety (P = 0.003) symptoms were associated with a poor global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score among recovered female participants (P = 0,034) who had low-to-medium education level (P = 0.004). Further studies (e.g. population-based longitudinal studies) are needed on sleep disturbances as a potential sequelae of COVID-19, because it can impair mental and physical well-being.

Troubles du sommeil aprÃƒÂ¨s la guÃƒÂ©rison de la COVID-19 : ÃƒÂ©tude transversale comparative en Ãƒâ€°gypte. Les sÃƒÂ©quelles post-COVID-19 sont de plus en plus souvent signalÃƒÂ©es, mais les troubles du sommeil aprÃƒÂ¨s la guÃƒÂ©rison de la maladie ont suscitÃƒÂ© peu d'attention. La prÃƒÂ©sente ÃƒÂ©tude visait Ãƒ identifier et Ãƒ comparer les troubles du sommeil et les corrÃƒÂ©lats associÃƒÂ©s chez les adultes qui avaient guÃƒÂ©ri de la COVID-19 et chez ceux qui n'avaient pas contractÃƒÂ© la maladie. Les ÃƒÂ©chantillons comprenaient 85 adultes guÃƒÂ©ris de la COVID-19 et 85 autres qui n'ont jamais ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© infectÃƒÂ©s de COVID-19 (appariÃƒÂ©s en fonction de l'ÃƒÂ¢ge, du sexe, du niveau d'ÃƒÂ©ducation et du niveau socio-ÃƒÂ©conomique). Des personnes ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© recrutÃƒÂ©es dans les hÃƒÂ´pitaux universitaires de Zagazig (Ãƒâ€°gypte) du 1er septembre au 29 novembre 2020. Les participants ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© interrogÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ l'aide d'une liste de contrÃƒÂ´le socio-dÃƒÂ©mographique et clinique, de l'index de qualitÃƒÂ© du sommeil de Pittsburgh et de l'ÃƒÂ©chelle d'anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© et de dÃƒÂ©pression de l'hÃƒÂ´pital. La plupart (77 %) des cas de COVID-19 guÃƒÂ©ris avaient prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ© des troubles du sommeil, contre 46 % des tÃƒÂ©moins. Les personnes qui s'ÃƒÂ©taient rÃƒÂ©tablies de la COVID-19 ÃƒÂ©taient plus susceptibles d'avoir une mauvaise qualitÃƒÂ© subjective du sommeil (odds ratio (OR) 1,5, intervalle de confiance (IC) Ãƒ 95 % : 1,1-2,1), une latence prolongÃƒÂ©e du sommeil (OR 1,8, IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,3-2,6), une durÃƒÂ©e de sommeil plus courte (OR : 1,6, IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,1-2,2), une efficacitÃƒÂ© courte du sommeil (OR 3,8, IC Ãƒ 95 % : 2,0-7 , 1), des dysfonctionnements frÃƒÂ©quents pendant la journÃƒÂ©e (OR 1,9, IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,2-3,1) et un score global mÃƒÂ©diocre de l'index de qualitÃƒÂ© du sommeil de Pittsburgh (OR 3,0, IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,5-6,0). Chez les participantes guÃƒÂ©ries (p = 0,034) qui avaient un niveau d'ÃƒÂ©ducation compris entre faible et modÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© (p = 0,004), les symptÃƒÂ´mes dÃƒÂ©pressifs (p = 0,002) et liÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ l'anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© (p = 0,003) ÃƒÂ©taient associÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ un score global mÃƒÂ©diocre de l'index de qualitÃƒÂ© du sommeil de Pittsburgh. D'autres ÃƒÂ©tudes (par exemple, des ÃƒÂ©tudes longitudinales en population) sont nÃƒÂ©cessaires sur les troubles du sommeil en tant que sÃƒÂ©quelles potentielles de la COVID-19 qui peuvent nuire au bien-ÃƒÂªtre mental et physique.","Abdelghani, Alsadik, Abdelmoaty, Atwa, Said, Hassan","https://doi.org/10.26719/emhj.22.006","20220215","COVID-19; Egypt; anxiety; depression; sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27037,""
"Psychiatric impact on COVID-19 patients isolated in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan","Adverse psychological effects have been associated with COVID-19-related disease containment measures, but little is known about the psychiatric symptoms and distress. This study aimed to explore and understand the psychiatric symptoms and distress in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients isolated and quarantined in hospital. A mixed methods study was conducted in the COVID-19 units of Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan; 114 out of 160 adult patients were assessed by telephone using validated scales (Stress Reactions and Adjustment Disorder Checklist, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Insomnia Severity Index) and a few open-ended questions about expectations and anticipated areas of need during hospitalization, including experiences with isolation. The prevalence of adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, anxiety, depressive symptoms and insomnia was 67.5%, 3.5%, 16.7%, 18.4%, and 29.8% respectively. One male patient tried to commit suicide during the study period. Fear, anger, low mood, anxiety and sleep disturbances were the most notable psychological consequences in qualitative the responses. Inadequate communication, poor ward facilities, concerns about the health of family members and financial problems were the most commonly identified factors leading to distress. Our results show alarmingly high levels of stress-related symptoms - insomnia, depression and anxiety - among COVID-19 confirmed or suspected hospitalized patients. There is a need to incorporate psychological services in the acute phase of illness for prompt recognition and management of psychiatric problems.

"Mental health outcomes of adults hospitalized for COVID-19: A systematic review",": Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may be at high risk of mental health (MH) disorders. This systematic review assesses MH outcomes among adults during and after hospitalization for COVID-19 and ascertains MH care utilization and resource needs. : We searched multiple medical literature databases for studies published December 2019 to March 2021. Studies of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 200 participants were synthesized. One reviewer completed article selection, data abstraction and assessed study quality and strength of evidence, with verification by a second. : Fifty articles met preliminary inclusion criteria; 19 articles that included Ã¢â€°Â¥200 participants were synthesized. Evidence from these primarily fair-quality studies suggests many patients experience symptoms of depression (9-66%), anxiety (30- 39%), and insomnia (24-40%) during and 3 months after hospitalization for COVID-19. However, patients infrequently receive a new MH disorder diagnosis 6 months after hospitalization (5% are diagnosed with a new mood disorder, 7% anxiety disorder, and 3% insomnia). Some hospitalized patients - including women and those with more severe COVID-19 - may be at higher risk of poor MH outcomes. Data on MH care utilization and resource needs are currently limited. : Most included studies were small, did not report the proportion of participants with preexisting MH disorders, and did not use comparison groups. : While many patients experience MH symptoms after hospitalization for COVID-19, most do not go on to develop a new MH disorder. Future studies should report whether participants have preexisting MH disorders and compare patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to patients hospitalized for other causes.","Veazie, Lafavor, Vela, Young, Sayer, Carlson, O'Neil","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100312","20220215","COVID-19; Hospitalization; Mental health; Post-acute; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27039,""
"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and carer mental health: an international multicentre study","As a global health emergency, the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led to the implementation of widespread restrictions (e.g., quarantine, physical/social distancing measures). However, while these restrictions reduce the viral spread of COVID-19, they may exacerbate behavioural and cognitive symptoms in dementia patients and increase pressure on caregiving. Here, we aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 and related restrictions on both carers and people living with dementia across the world. We conducted an international survey (Australia, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on carers and people living with dementia. People with dementia experienced worsened neuropsychiatric symptoms since the outbreak of COVID-19, most commonly, depression, apathy, delusions, anxiety, irritability, and agitation. Regression analyses revealed that limited understanding of the COVID-19 situation and not living with the carer was associated with worsened neuropsychiatric symptoms. Carers also reported a decline in their own mental health, increased stress and reduced social networks as a result of COVID-19 and related restrictions. Regression analyses revealed uncertainty about the future and loneliness were associated with worsened carer mental health. Findings from this study will inform strategies for the development of support services and compassionate protocols that meet the evolving needs of those living with dementia and their carers.","Wei, Diehl-Schmid, Matias-Guiu, Pijnenburg, Landin-Romero, Bogaardt, Piguet, Kumfor","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05687-w","20220215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27040,""
"Shifting Medication Treatment Practices in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Statewide Survey of Pennsylvania Opioid Treatment Programs","We sought to understand how opioid treatment programs (OTPs) adapted OTP operations to the COVID-19 pandemic and new federal regulations around methadone and buprenorphine. In fall 2020, we conducted an online survey of all 103 OTPs licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs, including clinical directors. Survey domains included changes to methadone take-home and telehealth practices; overdose and diversion prevention tactics; perceptions regarding how such changes influence patient well-being; and financial/operational concerns related to the new policies and practices. We calculated descriptive statistics and conducted Chi-square test to test for differences between not-for-profit versus for-profit and large versus small OTPs. Forty-seven percent (46%) OTPs responded to the survey. 10% and 25%, respectively, endorsed offering telephone and video-based telemedicine buprenorphine induction. Sixty-six percent endorsed extending take-home supplies of methadone, but most indicated that these extensions applied to a minority of their patients. Most respondents agreed that provision of buprenorphine via telehealth and extended take-home methadone reduced patient burden in accessing medications and prevented exposure to COVID-19, while not significantly increasing risk of overdose. We did not find major differences in COVID-19 practice modifications by nonprofit status or size of OTP. In Pennsylvania, the COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in provision of opioid treatment services. Findings on relatively low uptake of longer methadone take-home regimens and virtual buprenorphine initiation despite general support for these practices imply a need to further develop guidelines for best clinical practices and understand/address barriers to their implementation.","Krawczyk, Maniates, Hulsey, Smith, DiDomenico, Stuart, Saloner, Bandara","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000981","20220215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27041,""
"Primary care clinical management following self-harm during the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK: population-based cohort study","A substantial reduction in self-harm recorded in primary care occurred during the first wave of COVID-19 but effects on primary care management of self-harm are unknown. Our objectives were to examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical management within 3 months of an episode of self-harm. Retrospective cohort study. UK primary care. 4238 patients with an index episode of self-harm recorded in UK primary care during the COVID-19 first-wave period (10 March 2020-10 June 2020) compared with 48 739 patients in a prepandemic comparison period (10 March-10 June, 2010-2019). Using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we compared cohorts of patients with an index self-harm episode recorded during the prepandemic period versus the COVID-19 first-wave period. Patients were followed up for 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months to capture subsequent general practitioner (GP)/practice nurse consultation, referral to mental health services and psychotropic medication prescribing. We examined differences by gender, age group and Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile. Likelihood of having at least one GP/practice nurse consultation was broadly similar (83.2% vs 80.3% in the COVID-19 cohort). The proportion of patients referred to mental health services in the COVID-19 cohort (4.2%) was around two-thirds of that in the prepandemic cohort (6.1%). Similar proportions were prescribed psychotropic medication within 3 months in the prepandemic (54.0%) and COVID-19 first-wave (54.9%) cohorts. Despite the challenges experienced by primary healthcare teams during the initial COVID-19 wave, prescribing and consultation patterns following self-harm were broadly similar to prepandemic levels. We found no evidence of widening of digital exclusion in terms of access to remote consultations. However, the reduced likelihood of referral to mental health services warrants attention. Accessible outpatient and community services for people who have self-harmed are required as the COVID-19 crisis recedes and the population faces new challenges to mental health.","Steeg, Carr, Trefan, Ashcroft, Kapur, Nielsen, McMillan, Webb","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052613","20220215","COVID-19; primary care; public health; suicide &amp; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27042,""
"Golden opportunity for intervention? Identifying vitamin D deficiency in patients with substance use disorders in hospital","Based at a busy city hospital, the alcohol care team is a drug and alcohol specialist service, taking referrals for a wide range of patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Patients with SUD are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency; this relates to frequent fractures and proximal myopathy. The coronavirus pandemic brought vitamin D into focus. Local guidelines advise that patients at high risk of vitamin D deficiency are offered replacement. There were no local data on vitamin D deficiency prevalence or any mention of patients with SUD in local vitamin D guidelines. The main aim of this project was to offer vitamin D checks and replacement to all appropriate patients. We collected data on 207 patients, [pilot study (n=50) and two subsequent samples (n=95Ã¢â‚¬â€°and n=62)]. Our pilot study showed that no patients were offered vitamin D testing or replacement. We then offered vitamin D checks to 95 patients. Most had low vitamin D (30 patients were vitamin D deficient and 26 were vitamin D insufficient). We provided vitamin D replacement and follow-up advice. Quality improvement was demonstrated 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later. We collected data on a further 62 patients who were all on our current or recent caseload. Following exclusions, nearly half (48%) of patients had had a vitamin D check. Almost all of these (95%) had low vitamin D (60% being classified as deficient). Patients had not been offered vitamin D replacement despite often having multiple risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D checks (and subsequent replacement) rose in frequency since the outset of this project. Local guidelines should add SUD as a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Hospital admission provides a rich opportunity to offer this simple intervention to patients who are often poorly engaged with community services.","Smith, Gee, O'Brien, Vicente, Griffith, Patel, Stapleton, Finch, Shah, Gaughran, Taylor, Strang, Kalk","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001484","20220215","harm reduction; hospital medicine; mental health; quality improvement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27043,""
"Help-seeking attitudes and behaviours among youth with eating disorders: a scoping review","Although early intervention is crucial in interrupting the development of eating disorders, little is currently known about help-seeking behaviours among individuals experiencing eating disorder symptoms. Given that eating disorders typically begin early in life, it is necessary to investigate the processes employed by children, adolescents, and emerging adults when seeking services for troubling symptoms. This is a growing concern as the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the number of individuals engaging in disordered eating behaviours. This scoping review explores the current state of the literature for evidence on how youth with eating disorder symptoms seek help, with the aim of better understanding how to identify and treat more individuals earlier. Using scoping review methodology, we searched seven databases for studies published from January 2000 to April 2021 that reported on help-seeking attitudes, behaviours, and healthcare utilization patterns for children and adolescents (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years), emerging adults (18-25Ã‚Â years), and a mixture of these groups (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°25Ã‚Â years). Seven thousand, two hundred, and eighteen articles were identified for review. After duplicates were removed, three reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and reviewed full-text articles. Findings related to help-seeking activity were extracted from the 62 articles that were ultimately included in this scoping review. Study findings were summarized into help-seeking patterns (i.e., rates, types) as well as factors ranging from the individual level to society that influenced help-seeking behaviour. Many youth meeting eating disorder criteria were not seeking help. Notable barriers to help-seeking included poor mental health literacy, experiences with healthcare providers who failed to detect and lacked knowledge about eating disorders, minimal support from family and friends, and stigma surrounding eating disorders and help-seeking for mental health concerns. The results of this scoping review can be used to inform early intervention and health promotion program development. Future research should focus on the help-seeking attitudes and activities among underrepresented groups with eating disorders (e.g., men, ethnic and gender minorities), the perspectives of family and other supporters in the help-seeking process for youth, and retrospective accounts from adults with lived experience of an eating disorder. Plain English summary Addressing and interrupting eating disorder-related thoughts and behaviours as soon as possible, with the help of a mental health professional, leads to better outcomes for youth struggling with an eating disorder. However, little is known about what prompts youth to talk about their weight, body, or eating concerns with someone-like their parent, friend, teacher, guidance counsellor, or primary care practitioner. This review explores the available published research on help-seeking patterns and preferences among youth with eating disorder concerns. Our team followed a standardized process to find 62 relevant articles for this paper. Of note, many young people who reported eating disorder concerns were not seeking help for themselves. Feeling supported by family and their primary care provider, understanding the signs of an eating disorder, and not feeling shame for reaching out for help reportedly led youth to speak up about their concerns. The findings have clinical implications for learning effective ways to help youth feel safe to speak freely about their eating disorder-related concerns, which enhances the chances of intervening early and catching symptoms before they worsen.","Nicula, Pellegrini, Grennan, Bhatnagar, McVey, Couturier","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00543-8","20220215","Adolescents; Children; Early intervention; Eating disorders; Emerging adults; Health promotion; Help-seeking; Mental health; Treatment-seeking; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27044,""
"Shifting to Tele-Mental Health in humanitarian and crisis settings: an evaluation of MÃƒÂ©decins Sans FrontiÃƒÂ¨res experience during the COVID-19 pandemic","'Tele-Mental Health (MH) services,' are an increasingly important way to expand care to underserved groups in low-resource settings. In order to continue providing psychiatric, psychotherapeutic and counselling care during COVID-19-related movement restrictions, MÃƒÂ©decins Sans FrontiÃƒÂ¨res (MSF), a humanitarian medical organization, abruptly transitioned part of its MH activities across humanitarian and resource-constrained settings to remote format. From June-July of 2020, investigators used a mixed method, sequential explanatory study design to assess MSF staff perceptions of tele-MH services. Preliminary quantitative results influenced qualitative question guide design. Eighty-one quantitative online questionnaires were collected and a subset of 13 qualitative follow-up in-depth interviews occurred. Respondents in 44 countries (6 geographic regions), mostly from Sub-Saharan Africa (39.5%), the Middle East and North AfricaÃ‚Â (18.5%) and Asia (13.6%) participated. Most tele-MH interventions depended on audio-only platforms (80%). 30% of respondents reported that more than half of their patients were unreachable using these interventions, usually because of poor network coverage (73.8%), a lack of communication devices (72.1%), or a lack of a private space at home (67.2%). Nearly half (47.5%) of respondents felt their staff had a decreased ability to provide comprehensive MH care using telecommunication platforms. Most respondents thought MH staff had a negative (46%) or mixed (42%) impression of remote care. Nevertheless, almost all respondents (96.7%) thought tele-MH services had some degree of usefulness, notably improved access to care (37.7%) and time efficiency (32.8%). Qualitative results outlined a myriad of challenges, notably in establishing therapeutic alliance, providing care for vulnerable populations and those inherent to the communications infrastructure. Tele-MH services were perceived to be a feasible alternative solution to in-person therapeutic interventions in humanitarian settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they were not considered suitable for all patients in the contexts studied, especially survivors of sexual or interpersonal violence, pediatric and geriatric cases, and patients with severe MH conditions. Audio-only technologies that lacked non-verbal cues were particularly challenging and made risk assessment and emergency care more difficult. Prior to considering tele-MH services, communications infrastructure should be assessed, and comprehensive, context-specific protocols should be developed.","Ibragimov, Palma, Keane, Ousley, Crowe, CarreÃƒÂ±o, Casas, Mills, Llosa, Marques, Tijerino, Droste, Echeverri, Fredj, Sleit, Sultan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-022-00437-1","20220215","MHPSS; Remote mental health; Tele-counselling; Tele-mental health; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27045,""
"Family caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic: factors associated with anxiety and depression of carers for community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupts the daily routine and increases the caregiving load of the family carers of older adults. This study examined how the pandemic may impact mental health and investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in family carers of older people. Two hundred and thirty-six family carers of older adults participated in this cross-sectional survey study. Outcome measures included their symptoms of anxiety and depression, pandemic-related psychosocial factors, external factors, and the practice of preventive behaviours. Caseness prevalence of anxiety and depression among family carers was 25 and 56% respectively. Working carers were more depressed than non-working, while younger carers reported more anxiety and depression symptoms than older. Hand hygiene and getting drugs from the hospital positively predicted depression while healthy lifestyle negatively predicted depression. These variables, together with perceived risk and severity and the worry of getting infected, predicted anxiety. The prevalence of mental health symptoms was alarming. Telemedicine practice, including online pharmaceutical services and the Internet Hospital plus Drug Delivery platform, could be a solution in alleviating the burden and worry of infection of family carers. Tailored-made interventions by age and working status of the family carers are recommended.","Chiu, Leung, Li, Yeung, Lo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02741-6","20220215","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Family carers; Hong Kong","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27046,""
"A Pilot Observational Exploratory Study of Well-Being in Hospice Interdisciplinary Team Members","Well-being and turnover intent represent key aspects to the promotion of a healthy workforce. Alarming levels of burnout and low levels of well-being have been documented in health professionals across care settings. Not only do high levels of burnout, low well-being and high turnover affect health professionals, but they are associated with poor patient care. However, limited research has investigated this topic specifically in hospice interdisciplinary team (IDT) members, nurses, chaplains, social workers. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore hospice IDT members' well-being, and turnover intent. This observational, pilot study used quantitative surveys to examine the well-being, and turnover intention at baseline and at 3 months. Twenty-five hospice IDT members at one site participated. Paired t-tests and percent change demonstrated significant decreases in compassion satisfaction (44.5 vs. 42.1, p = 0.04) and secondary traumatic stress score (18.5 vs. 13.3, p = 0.0001) and a significant increase in burnout score (17.6 vs. 20.5, p = 0.03) from baseline to follow up. Employee turnover slightly decreased from baseline to follow-up. In this pilot study, hospice IDT members had low levels of well-being at baseline that worsened over 3-months indicating a higher potential risk for burnout. Moreover, given the COVID-19 pandemic, this may be an ominous sign of what lies ahead for hospice providers regarding turnover, leading to significant long-term staffing problems in the field. If these results hold true in a larger sample, it could necessitate developing and testing further strategies to ensure a healthy and stable workforce.","Schneider, Bristol, Ford, Lin, Brody, Stimpfel","https://doi.org/10.1177/10499091211023480","20220215","dementia symptom management; burnout; hospice; interdisciplinary hospice team; palliative care; professional quality of life; turnover intent; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27047,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Protocols on the Continuity of Care for Patients with Hypertension","The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the continuity of care (COC) for patients with hypertension. Additionally, the factor of whether participants were treated via telemedicine was also considered. This study used the National Health Insurance and Medical Aid claims data of the Republic of Korea between 2019 and 2020. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the differences in the number of visits and the most frequent provider continuity (MFPC) of hypertensive patients before and after the appearance of COVID-19 in Korea. Additional analysis was performed with data that excluded cases of patients who received telemedicine services. A total of 5,791,812 hypertensive patients were included in this study. The MFPC decreased by 0.0031 points after the appearance of COVID-19, and it showed the same decrease even when telemedicine cases were excluded. The number of outpatient clinic visit days decreased by 0.2930 days after the appearance of COVID-19. Without the telemedicine cases, the number of outpatient clinic visit days decreased by 0.3330 days after the appearance of COVID-19. Accordingly, the COVID-19 protocols did not affect hypertension patients' COC but impacted the frequency of their outpatient visits. In other words, with or without telemedicine, the utilization of healthcare was not disrupted, but there was a significant difference in the volume of healthcare use depending on the inclusion of telemedicine cases.","Lee, Chun, Park","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031735","20220215","continuity of care; most frequent provider continuity; primary care; social distancing; social isolation; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27048,""

"Women's Lived Experiences with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF): How TANF Can Better Support Women's Wellbeing and Reduce Intimate Partner Violence","Women experiencing poverty are more likely to face intimate partner violence (IPV), poor health, and stigma. IPV survivors are overrepresented among those who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a conditional cash program serving families experiencing poverty. More generous TANF policies may be protective against IPV, but a greater insight into TANF's effect could be gleaned through a contemporaneous study that examines intersecting determinants of wellbeing and engages community interpretation of findings. Using an adapted Family Stress Model framework and analyzing data through an intersectional and community-based lens, we explore the impact of TANF on women's wellbeing through in-depth, semi-structured interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic with 13 women who had TANF experience in three U.S. states. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis in MAXQDA and researchers facilitated three member-checking events to enhance validity of result interpretation. Four themes emerged: (1) Low cash and conditional benefits provided limited short-term ""relief"" but contributed to poverty and hard choices; (2) TANF benefit levels and conditions increased women's dependence on others, straining relationships; (3) Women undertook extraordinary measures to access TANF, largely to fulfill their roles as mothers; and (4) TANF stigma creates psychological stress, differentially experienced by African Americans. Increasing TANF cash benefits and other cash transfers for those experiencing poverty, adopting solely state funded TANF programs, increasing funding for TANF administration, addressing TANF stigma and racialized narratives, and allowing optional child support participation or a larger ""pass-through"" of child support are important steps toward making TANF more protective against IPV.","Spencer, Lemon, Komro, Livingston, Woods-Jaeger","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031170","20220215","Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; depression; intimate partner violence; structural discrimination; welfare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27052,""
"Hope and Fear of Threats as Predictors of Coping with Two Major Adversities, the COVID-19 Pandemic and an Armed Conflict","Coping with adversities has been explained by two major theories: the fear appeal theory and the hope theory. The predictability of hope with that of fear of threats as variables explaining coping with two major adversities, the COVID-19 pandemic and an armed conflict, was compared. Participants were approached via an internet panel company in two different times: (1) January 2021 (<i>N</i> = 699; age range: 18-82; 330 women), during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and (2) May 2021 (<i>N</i> = 647; age range: 19-83; 297 women), during an armed conflict between Israel and Hamas. Participants self-reported on hope, four perceived threats (health, economics, security, and political), well-being, individual resilience, societal resilience, and distress symptoms (anxiety and depression symptoms) were collected. Hope was found as a more consistent and stronger predictor of the following expressions of coping: well-being, individual and societal resilience, depression, and anxiety. It can be concluded that hope is a better and more consistent predictor of coping, as well as coping suppressing expressions, compared with fear of threats, in the face of the current adversities. The innovative nature of these findings, the importance of hope as a coping supporter, and the need for replicating these innovative results are discussed and elaborated.","Marciano, Eshel, Kimhi, Adini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031123","20220215","COVID-19; anxiety; armed conflict; depression; distress; hope; perceived threats; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27053,""
"Mixed Reality-Based Interaction between Human and Virtual Cat for Mental Stress Management","Human-animal interaction (HAI) has been observed to effectively reduce stress and induce positive emotions owing to the process of directly petting and interacting with animals. Interaction with virtual animals has recently emerged as an alternative due to the limitations in general physical interactions, both due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, more generally, due to the difficulties involved in providing adequate care for animals. This study proposes mixed reality (MR)-based human-animal interaction content along with presenting the experimental verification of its effect on the reduction of mental stress. A mental arithmetic task was employed to induce acute mental stress, which was followed by either MR content, in which a participant interacted with virtual animals via gestures and voice commands, or a slide show of animal images. During the experiment, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously recorded with a patch-type, wireless ECG sensor on the chest of the subject, and their psychological state was evaluated with the help of questionnaires after each task. The findings of the study demonstrate that the MR-based interaction with virtual animals significantly reduces mental stress and induces positive emotions. We expect that this study could provide a basis for the widespread use of MR-based content in the field of mental health.","Na, Park, Dong","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22031159","20220215","humanÃ¢â‚¬â€œanimal interaction; mental stress relief; mixed reality; virtual animal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27054,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Elderly Patients with Spinal Disorders","During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, home-quarantine has been necessary, resulting in lifestyle changes that might negatively affect patients with spinal disorders, including a reduction in their quality of life (QoL) and activities of daily living (ADLs). However, studies on this impact are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the age-related changes in QoL and ADLs in patients with spinal disorders, and also identify factors associated with decline in ADLs. This multicenter cross-sectional study included patients who visited four private spine clinics for any symptoms. The study participants either had a clinic reservation, were first-time clinic visitors, or had a return visit to the clinic. The participants completed several questionnaires at two points: pre-pandemic and post-second wave. Changes in patient symptoms, exercise habits, ADLs, and health-related QoL were assessed. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of each variable for decline in ADLs. We included 606 patients; among them, 281 and 325 patients were aged &lt;65 and Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years, respectively. Regarding exercise habits, 46% and 48% of the patients in the &lt;65 and Ã¢â€°Â¥65-year age groups, respectively, did not change their exercise habits. In contrast, 40% and 32% of the patients in the &lt;65 and Ã¢â€°Â¥65-year age groups, respectively, decreased their exercise habits.

"A year with the fear of COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis patients: Examination of depression, sleep quality and quality of life before and after the pandemic","The COVID-19 outbreak, which has caused great fear and has affected many aspects of life even in healthy individuals, could become more threatening for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The aim of the present study was to evaluate depression, sleep and quality of life before and one year after the COVID-19 pandemic in PwMS and the association between the fear of COVID-19 and these parameters. A total of 89 PwMS and 262 healthy controls were included in this descriptive cross-sectional study. The study compared the data collected before the pandemic with the data collected online approximately one year after the onset of the pandemic. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Worry and Anxiety Questionnaire (WAQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the MS Quality of life scale (MSQoL-54) were used as data collection tools. The mean age of the patients was 41.08 (Ã‚Â±10.2) years; 62% were female and half (50.6%) of the patients were not working. The mean EDSS and the mean duration of diagnosis were found to be 1.33(Ã‚Â±1.6) and 7.73(Ã‚Â±6.1), respectively. The mean age of the control group was 38.08 (Ã‚Â±11.4) and 51.5% were female. In both groups, social (PwMS 79.8% vs HC 89.3%) and psychological (PwMS 61.8% vs HC 51.9%) fields were found to have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic most. Of the patients, 19% reported that the frequency of exacerbations increased during the pandemic. In the patient group, the fear of coronavirus (p=0.808) and the sleep quality (p=0.906) were found not to be different to those in control group; however, the anxiety (p=0.001) and depression (p=0.001) levels were determined to be significantly higher. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the sleep quality of the patients was seen to be impaired during the pandemic (p&lt;0.05); however, the depression scores were seen not to change (p&gt;0.05). Although there were improvements in energy/vitality (p&lt;0.001) and sexual function (p=0.002) scale scores, compared to the pre-pandemic period, deterioration in many sub-dimensions of quality of life was detected. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the anxiety, depression, and the sleep problems were predictors of both the physical health (p&lt;0.001) and the mental health (p&lt;0.001) sub-dimensions. The fear of coronavirus was determined not to have a significant effect on the quality of life (p&gt;0.05). It was determined that PwMS and were psychosocially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and had a significant deterioration in sleep quality at the end of a year spent with the pandemic. In addition, there was a deterioration in depression scores, although it was not statistically significant. Considering the fact that many subdimensions of quality of life, especially those associated with mental health, were impaired, it can be said that providing psychosocial support to patients is an important necessity.","Yeni, Tulek, Terzi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.103370","20220215","Fear of COVID-19; Mental health; Multiple sclerosis; Quality of life; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27056,""
"Two Sides of the Same Coin: A Mixed Methods Study of Black Mothersâ€™ Experiences with Violence, Stressors, Parenting, and Coping during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to systemic and structural inequities, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacts the Black community, along with ongoing anti-Black racism and violence. Violence against women in the home, particularly Black women, was prevalent during shelter in place, along with the additional family responsibilities of Black mothers. Crenshawâ€™s theory of intersectionality (1991) provides a foundation for examining Black mothersâ€™ experiences during shelter-in-place mandates. This mixed-methods study aimed to quantitatively assess violence victimization, acknowledged racial inequities, depression and anxiety, while qualitatively examining Black mothersâ€™ experiences in parenting during shelter-in-place orders. Participants (N = 127; Mage = 32.4 years) were mothers who self-identify as Black or African American living in a Midwestern US city. Results showed that Black mothers who perceived greater COVID-19 inequities in the Black community reported increased parental stress, decreased emotional support, greater exposure to physical or sexual violence, and higher symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Qualitative results yielded numerous themes, including the integrative theme of two sides of the same coin, highlighting both positive parenting experiences and significant stressors for Black mothers. The implications point to the need for intersectional and feminist approaches to interventions and initiatives that support Black women as humans, mothers, souls, and spirits.","Lama Hassoun Ayoub et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0092-18F-D1D","20220216","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27057,""
"Covid-19-related stressors and mental disorders and distress: A cross-sectional, nationally-representative, face-to-face survey in Serbia","Aim. The Covid-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in mental disorders and mental distress. However, there are no representative studies testing the impact of stressors directly related to Covid-19. We aimed to determine whether Covid-19 related stressors were associated with mental disorders and mental distress in the second year of the pandemic. Method. This cross-sectional observational epidemiological survey was conducted from June to October 2021. We interviewed a representative sample of the adult population in Serbia (18-65 years) in the second year of the pandemic, at a time when large parts of the population had been affected by the pandemic in different ways. Multistage probabilistic household sampling of the adult population in 60 municipalities was used. Mental disorders were assessed by in-person interviews using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and depression and anxiety symptoms were self-rated on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Covid-19 related stressors i.e., infection, self-isolation, infection of a close relative, and lack of protective equipment at work, as well as stressors during the pandemic that were not directly Covid-19 related were measured. Associations of potential predictor variables with mental disorders and mental distress were explored through univariable and multivariable regression analyses. Results. In total, 1023 individuals (mean age 43.7Â±13.6 years, 48.7% male) were interviewed. Most respondents (67.8%) of the sample had already experienced Covid-19 related stressors (20.1% had Covid-19 infection; 43.2% had a close relative member who had Covid-19; 28.1% had to work without appropriate protection; 27.5% had been in quarantine themselves) and about 50% had already been vaccinated. The prevalence of any mental disorder was 15.2% (95% CI 13.2â€“17.2): mood disorders 4.6%, anxiety disorders 4.3% and substance use disorders 8.0%. Mean levels of distress were: PHQ-9=3.2Â±3.8; GAD-7=2.1Â±3.1. A lack of protective equipment was associated with higher levels of any disorder, anxiety disorders, and anxiety symptoms. No other Covid-19 related stressor predicted mental disorders or mental distress. Conclusions. In this study, lack of personal protective equipment for Covid-19 when it would have been appropriate was associated with higher levels of anxiety and a greater frequency of anxiety disorders. Provision of the appropriate equipment at workplaces is likely to prevent lasting increased levels of anxiety. There is no evidence that the prevalence of mental disorders in the second year was elevated.","Nadja P Maric et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0103-1E8-DF5","20220216","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-16","",27058,""
