"The Effect of Education and Follow-up Provided via Tele-nursing on the Quality of Life of Patients With COVID-19","Background Patient education and follow-up can be accomplished without time or space constraints via tele-nursing. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of education and follow-up provided via tele-nursing on the quality of life of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Method This semi-experimental study used a pretest-posttest design in a single group. It was conducted between April 1, 2021, and October 1, 2021, with 63 patients who presented to a state hospital. The Patient Information Form and the Duke Health Profile were administered to the patients prior to the education. Then, the patients completed the COVID-19 education program. Next, follow-up and counseling occurred via tele-nursing every other day for 14 days. At the end of the 14th day, the Duke Health Profile was once again administered to the patients. Results The patients had decreased physical, mental, and social health scores after the intervention. In addition, their pain, anxiety, and depression scores decreased. Conclusion Nurses should assume a more active role in patient education and include tele-nursing in nursing care. <b>[<i>J Contin Educ Nurs</i>. 2022;53(8):365-371.]</b>.","Ãƒâ€“kten, GÃƒÂ¼ndoÃ„Å¸an","https://doi.org/10.3928/00220124-20220706-07","20220801","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35426,""
"Education and patient care in a chiropractic teaching clinic: An organizational approach to health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic","The academic teaching clinic at our chiropractic college in California remained open beginning in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place order requiring individuals to stay at home except for essential activities. We report the experiences described by health center personnel who were present during the shelter-in-place early stages. Narrative approach and descriptive thematic analysis of transcripts of 15 interviews with faculty, staff, and student interns. Report of key events and processes for developing ongoing COVID-related policies and procedures to conform with state and county public health mandates. Themes included (1) Organizational processes and procedures; (2) Perceptions of safety; (3) Successful adaptations and responses; (4) Challenges; (5) Mental health and well-being; (6) Unanticipated benefits and opportunities; and (7) Reflections on chiropractic philosophy. Participants' initial fears diminished as they gained confidence in the safety conferred by the new procedures and a returning sense of normalcy. They discussed the importance of social connection, chiropractic wellness philosophy, and their personal beliefs within the context of the pandemic and public health mandates. Despite initial reductions in numbers of patients and procedures that could be performed, patients received continuing chiropractic care and interns were able to complete their academic requirements while experiencing unique learning opportunities. Despite substantial challenges, the rapid response in the early stages of the pandemic enabled the college to fulfill the multiple missions of providing patient care, community support, and uninterrupted clinical education to student interns while conforming to public health mandates and guidelines.","Odierna, Smith","https://doi.org/10.7899/JCE-21-37","20220801","COVID-19 Pandemic; Chiropractic; Education; Public Health, Patient Care, Mental Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35427,""
"Patients Receive Flexible And Accessible Care When State Workforce Barriers Are Removed","In response to COVID-19, many states increased their supply of health care workers, using emergency policies to remove barriers such as state licensure requirements. The experience in New Jersey suggests that most health care workers who obtained a temporary license, including physicians, nurses, and mental health providers, provided care for existing patients for COVID-19- and non-COVID-19-related conditions, mostly through telehealth. State variation in licensure requirements, as well as scope of practice, may be a barrier to patients having flexible, accessible, and continuous care. As states emerge from the pandemic, emergency policies that expand health workforce supply by removing these state-level barriers should be made permanent.","Frogner","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00759","20220801","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35428,""
"I feel you: Prepandemic physiological synchrony and emotional contagion during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact on mental well-being and interpersonal relationships. Nonetheless, little is known about the complex interactions between one's overall perceived interpersonal closeness and physiological or psychological aspects of interpersonal functioning. This study aimed to understand the interaction between perceived interpersonal closeness during COVID-19 and interpersonal mechanisms in predicting well-being. We focused on two interpersonal mechanisms, one physiological and the other psychological: (a) prepandemic physiological synchrony, a physiological measure of interpersonal coupling, and (b) peripandemic emotional contagion, one's tendency to ""catch"" others' emotions. One hundred fifty-five participants took part in the study. Cardiological interbeat interval synchrony was collected 1.5 to 3 years prior to the beginning of the COVID pandemic in two previous lab studies. Participants were recontacted during the pandemic, this time to complete several questionnaires tapping into perceived interpersonal closeness, tendency for emotional contagion, and psychological well-being during COVID. As hypothesized, overall perceived interpersonal closeness was positively related to well-being. Moreover, this effect was moderated by one's tendency for emotional contagion or by physiological synchrony. Thus, individuals with higher emotional contagion scores or higher physiological synchrony had higher well-being if their interpersonal closeness was perceived as greater. Conversely, their well-being was lower if they perceived their interpersonal closeness as weaker. These results emphasize that individuals may be differentially susceptible to the effects of their relationships on their well-being. Future mental health interventions should consider both the quality of one's perceived interpersonal closeness and the extent to which one is sensitive to others' emotional experiences.

"Changes in Smoking Cessation-Related Behaviors Among US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Smoking cessation is an urgent public health priority given that smoking is associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and other diseases. It is unknown how smoking cessation changed nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate changes in smoking cessation-related behaviors in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted using 2011 to 2020 data on 788Ã¢â‚¬Â¯008 individuals who had smoked in the past year from the nationally representative Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Representative retail scanner sales data between January 2017 and July 2021 for 1004 unique nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) universal product codes in 31 US states from NielsenIQ were also used. Calendar year and 4-week sales periods. Changes in annual self-reported prevalence of past-year quit attempts and recent successful cessation before (ie, 2011-2019) and during (ie, 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in sales volumes in millions of pieces of nicotine gum, lozenge, and patch brands before (1271 four-week sales periods between January 2017 and February 2020) and during (558 four-week sales periods between March 2020 and July 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic were calculated. The 2011 to 2020 pooled BRFSS sample (response rate range, 45.2%-49.9%) included 788Ã¢â‚¬Â¯008 respondents (243Ã¢â‚¬Â¯061 individuals ages 25-44 years [weighted percentage, 42.5%]; 374Ã¢â‚¬Â¯519 men [weighted percentage, 55.7%]). For the first time since 2011, annual past-year quit attempt prevalence decreased between 2019 and 2020, from 65.2% (95% CI, 64.5% to 65.9%) to 63.2% (95% CI, 62.3% to 64.0%), with the largest relative decreases among individuals ages 45 to 64 years (61.4% [95% CI, 60.3% to 62.5%] vs 57.7% [95% CI, 56.3% to 59.2%]), those with 2 or more comorbidities (67.1% [95% CI, 66.0% to 68.2%] to 63.0% [95% CI, 61.6% to 64.4%]), and Black individuals (72.5% [95% CI, 70.3 to 74.6] vs 68.4% [95% CI, 65.3% to 71.3%]). Recent successful cessation remained unchanged during 2019 to 2020. Observed mean (SD) 4-week NRT sales volume in the prepandemic period was 105.6 (66.2) million gum pieces, 51.9 (31.6) million lozenges, and 2.0 (1.1) million patches. Compared with expected sales, observed sales during the COVID-19 pandemic were lower by 13.0% (95% CI, -13.7% to -12.3%) for lozenges, 6.4% (95% CI, -7.3% to -5.5%) for patches, and 1.2% (95% CI, -1.7% to -0.7%) for gum. This study found that serious smoking cessation activity among US adults decreased immediately and remained depressed for more than a year during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that smokers experiencing disproportionately negative outcomes during the pandemic should be reengaged and assisted in quit attempts.","Bandi, Asare, Majmundar, Xue, Han, Westmaas, Nargis, Jemal","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25149","20220801","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35430,""
"Psychological distress and morbidity of family members experiencing virtual visiting in intensive care during COVID-19: an observational cohort study","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, intensive care units (ICUs) around the world introduced virtual visiting to mediate the psychological impact of in-person visiting restrictions. Our objective was to evaluate levels of distress, depression, anxiety, and stress among family members experiencing virtual visits. Multi-centre prospective observational study recruiting adult family members of critically ill patients in the United Kingdom (UK) using a bespoke virtual visiting solution (aTouchAway). We recruited participants and administered validated questionnaires digitally via their aTouchAway account. Prior to first virtual visit, participants completed the Distress Thermometer (score range 0-10) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)-21. Following first and subsequent virtual visits, participants repeated the Distress Thermometer and completed the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire. We recruited 2166 adult family members of ICU patients in 37 UK hospitals. Most were grown up children (33%) or spouses/partners (23%). Most (91%) wereÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°65Ã‚Â years. Mean (SD) pre-virtual-visit Distress Thermometer score was 7 (2.6) with 1349/2153 (62%) reporting severe distress. Pre-visit Distress Thermometer scores were associated with relationship type (spouse/partner OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-2.12) but not family member age, or length of ICU stay. Mean (SD) post-visit Distress Thermometer score provided by 762 (35%) participants was 1.6 (3.2) points lower than pre-visit (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Of participants experiencing multiple visits, 22% continued to report severe distress. Median (IQR) pre-visit DASS-21 score was 18 (2-42) (1754 participants). Severe-to-extremely severe depression, anxiety, or stress were reported by 249 (14%), 321 (18%), and 165 (9%) participants, respectively. Participants reported a range of emotions with reassurance being the most common, anger being the least. Family members exposed to COVID-19 pandemic ICU visiting restrictions experienced severe distress. One fifth of family members reported severe-to-extremely sever anxiety or depression. Distress score magnitude and prevalence of severe distress decreased after undertaking one or more virtual visits.","Rose, Cook, Onwumere, Terblanche, Pattison, Metaxa, Meyer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-022-06824-9","20220801","COVID-19; Family; Intensive care; Psychological distress; Virtual visiting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35431,""
"Efficacy of a peer-based in-home education program in improving social-emotional outcomes of parents and children","Significant disparities in education and social-emotional outcomes exist between racial/ethnic groups, particularly impacting children growing up in impoverished environments. Home visitation intervention programs, such as the Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), have been used for decades to improve academic readiness in these vulnerable preschool-aged children. Although the benefits of HIPPY on academic readiness and performance are well-documented, there has been no examination of social-emotional benefits to participating parent-child dyads. This study followed a HIPPY cohort over the course of 1Ã‚Â year to evaluate change in maternal and child social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Program participants demonstrated reduced parental stress and depression and increased parental social connection as well as reduced child externalizing behaviors and improved child adaptive functioning over the course of the program, even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown. These data highlight the additional benefits of early home-based academic intervention programs.","Koop, Holliday, Mathews, Namaste, Alt, Biel","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.22010","20220801","home visitation; parent-child dyads; preschool; social-emotional functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35432,""
"Changes in EMS utilization in the state of Maryland during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic","Emergency medical services (EMS) is an invaluable healthcare resource, providing life-saving care in the prehospital setting. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been concerns that healthcare resources, including EMS, would be overwhelmed by the potential surge in critically ill patients. This study seeks to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EMS utilization in the state of Maryland. A retrospective review of data from the Maryland Emergency Medical Services Data System was performed. EMS call volumes were compared from March 1 to August 31 in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. In addition, adult cases from the three time periods that contained an EMS impression of stroke, cardiac arrest, asthma, traumatic injury, ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), sepsis, and overdose were also analyzed. There was a significant decrease in overall EMS call volumes in the state of Maryland in the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the prior 2 years. While the total number of calls decreased, a higher proportion of patients in 2020 had EMS impressions of cardiac arrest, STEMI, stroke, and traumatic injury compared to the previous 2 years. Additionally, there was an increase in termination of resuscitation for out of hospital cardiac arrest. In the state of Maryland, overall call volumes decreased, but the proportion of EMS patients with time-sensitive illnesses increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jasani, Alemayehu, Chizmar, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.5055/ajdm.2022.0418","20220801","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35433,""
"Recognition between CD147 and cyclophilin A deciphered by accelerated molecular dynamics simulations","CD147 functions as the receptor of extracellular cyclophilin A (CypA) in various diseases, and CD147-CypA binding ulteriorly underlies the pathological process of various viral infections including HIV-1, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2. Although CyPA has been identified as a key intermediate pro-inflammatory factor, the mechanism by which CD147 cooperates with CypA in the development of the cytokine storm remains largely unknown, and the binding profile of CD147 with CypA remains to be elucidated as well. Here, we prepared three binding models of the CD147-CypA complex, including the active site of CypA severally binding to the groove bound by the Ig1 and Ig2 domains (model-0), P180-G181 (model-1), and P211 (model-2) of CD147, as well as introducing mutations P180A-G181A and P211A individually in each model. All systems were studied using accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. For model-0, CypA bound to the ectodomain of CD147 with the highest binding affinity. Moreover, mutations P180A-G181A of CD147 in model-0 decreased the binding affinity and weakened the dynamic correlation between CD147 and CypA, which resulted in CypA shifting from the initial binding location. Other residue mutations of CD147 did not significantly affect the CD147-CypA binding, as reflected by the energy and structural analyses. Compared with surface plasmon resonance results and nuclear magnetic resonance shift signals, CypA should tend to reciprocally bind to the groove of CD147, and the binding process might be modulated by P180-G181 rather than P211. Besides, residue R201 of CD147 is critical for CD147-CypA binding and needs further experimental verification. These findings further our understanding of the recruitment between CD147 and CypA and its potential role in the development of inflammation and viral infection.","Yang, Zang, Wang, Kang, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1039/d2cp01975b","20220801","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35434,""

"Healthy workplace onboard: Insights gained from the COVID-19 impact on mental health and wellbeing of seafarers","Seafarers' psychological health is seriously affected by COVID-19. The pandemic could act as a catalyst for change with respect to seafarers' mental health protection and promotion. The study explores the main factors contributing to the mental health and wellbeing of seafarers. Moreover, elements to help seafarers lessen the impact of the pandemic on their work and life onboard are analyzed, and their role in developing a positive psychosocial environment and promoting a healthy workplace onboard are discussed. The study involved the use of an ad hoc questionnaire and the adoption of both quantitative and qualitative methods. The sample included one hundred and five active seafarers. Ninety-six percent of the sample stated that mental health is a very or extremely important part of their general health. Seafarers perceive that their mental health has been seriously impacted by COVID-19. Major factors contributing to seafarers' mental health and wellbeing reveal three groups of factors: rest and spare time-related factors, communication/relationship with the external world, and interaction and social life on board factors. Strategies suggested by seafarers for coping with ""inevitable"" psychological stress produced by COVID-19 and promoting their wellbeing include managerial, emotional, facilities-related (including communication infrastructure), physical, and social elements to promote wellbeing. Economic, intellectual, and spiritual elements also have to be taken into consideration and require further investigation. Building on seafarers' insights and experiences, a healthy environment onboard should cultivate holistically the four main spheres of a healthy workplace (physical work environment, psychosocial work environment, personal health resources, and enterprise community involvement) and the five features of a healthy psychosocial environment (social, emotional, physical, intellectual and spiritual) under all circumstances, whether exceptional or ordinary.","Carrera-Arce, BartuseviÃ„ÂienÃ„â€”, Divari","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210791","20220801","Healthy work environment; pandemic; psychological health; seafaring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35436,""

"Investigating the Impacts of Information Overload on Psychological Well-being of Healthcare Professionals: Role of COVID-19 Stressor","While past research has focused on the benefits of social media during pandemics, this study emphasizes the possible negative effects of social media use among healthcare professionals. It has been stated that healthcare professionals are exposed to COVID-19 and its impacts on the mental health of these workers. Even though recognizing the importance of healthcare professionals during the pandemic, the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been rarely considered for investigation by researchers. By applying differential susceptibility to the media effects model (DSMM), the current article investigated the effect of COVID-19 information overload (CIO) on psychological and mental well-being and underline mechanisms. Time-wave technique was applied to collect the data. This study tested moderated mediation model by collecting data from 314 healthcare professionals. The findings stated that COVID-19 information overload impacted COVID-19 fatalism and COVID-19 exhaustion directly. Likewise, COVID-19 fatalism mediated the association between CIO and COVID-19 exhaustion. Moreover, the COVID-19 stressor moderated this mediating relationship.

"InGaAs based gratings for UV-VIS spectrometer in prospective mRNA vaccine research","During the outbreak of the COVID-19 illness, mRNA (messenger RNA) injections proved to be effective vaccination. Among the presently available analytical techniques, UV/VIS spectrophotometry is a trustworthy and practical instrument that may provide information on the chemical components of the vaccine at the molecular level. In this paper, we will present a one-dimensional grating of InGaAs as a prospect grating structure for UV-VIS spectrometer that can be used for mRNA vaccine development. The main parameters and the wavelength region used in mRNA vaccine development lies in the range of 200Ã‚Â nm to 700Ã‚Â nm (UV-VIS Range). The incorporation of new materials that are excellent for cutting-edge semiconductor industry procedures for MEMS manufacture, as well as new optimal parameters, will improve the grating and spectrometer's performance which will enhance the mRNA vaccine development and manufacturing workflows enabled by UV-VIS spectroscopy. Hence we evaluated the feasibility of the materials, Si (Silicon), GaN (Gallium Nitride), InGaAs (Indium Gallium Arsenide) and InP (Indium Phosphide) as a grating material. Reflection spectrum of the proposed structure shows 48% increase compared to the grating made up of Silicon. In order to model wave propagation in one grating unit cell, electromagnetic waves frequency domain interface is used. The periodic constraints of floquet periodicity are used for simulation at both faces of the unit cell.

"Perceptions of Homeless Adults and Their Providers on Coping With the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health, Substance Use, and Harm Reduction Services","Adults experiencing homelessness experience a disproportionate burden of health disparities which has further exacerbated mental health, substance use, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic. As limited data is available to understand the experience of adults experiencing homelessness and their health during this time, the purpose of this study was to explore how COVID-19 may have impacted their mental health, substance use, and ways of coping in this population. Using community-based participatory research, a community advisory board was established and remote individual interviews with 21 adults experiencing homelessness and 10 providers were conducted in Skid Row, Los Angeles. Using a qualitative, data analytic approach, the following major themes emerged: (1) Negative Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health; (2) Negative Impact of COVID-19 on Limitation of Harm Reduction Services; and (3) Coping Strategies Utilized During the COVID-19 Pandemic. More research is needed to understand the impact of this pandemic on underserved communities.","Nyamathi, Gelberg, Lee, Arce, Patten-Jones, Yadav, Goodwine, Alikhani, Yao, Chang, Salem","https://doi.org/10.1177/23333936221108712","20220801","COVID-19; Western USA; adults experiencing homelessness; mental health; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35441,""
"Two Cases of COVID-19-Related Deaths Unaccounted for: A Call for Action","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) high-risk survivors experience long-term COVID-19 symptoms. Hence, these individuals require early and ubiquitous respiratory rehabilitation to avoid malnutrition. We report the case of a 93-year-old woman who recovered from moderate II severity (pneumonia requiring oxygen). The patient, after prolonged hospitalization, demonstrated low severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity and showed no COVID-19 respiratory symptoms for more than 72 hours. Subsequently, the patient became debilitated and lost her appetite without dysphagia, dysgeusia, and smell disorder, developed nosocomial pneumonia as a sequela of acute COVID-19 and died. We also report the second case of an 84-year-old man diagnosed with moderate II COVID-19 severity. After recovery, the patient was frail due to the previous onset of COVID-19 and worsened during his stay at home, losing appetite without dysphagia, dysgeusia, and smell disorder, and dying of senility as the official cause. Recovered COVID-19 appears to be a health risk by malnutrition without anorexia and depression, among other conditions. A proven rehabilitation program for each phase of the disease is required for better lung function and nutritional status.","Usami","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.26238","20220801","covid-19; mortality; pcr; pneumonia; rehabilitation; sars-cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35442,""
"Pulmonary Barotrauma in COVID-19 Patients: Experience From a Secondary Care Hospital in Oman","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many patients developed pulmonary barotrauma either self-inflicted or ventilator-induced. In pulmonary barotrauma,Ã‚Â air leaks into extra-alveolar tissue resulting in pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum. Methods After obtaining institutional approval, we retrospectively reviewed data from March 1, 2021, to September 31, 2021. Being a retrospective study, informed consent was not applicable. Patient data were collected from the Al Shifa patient information portal, which is an electronic medical record system available to all hospitals inÃ‚Â the Ministry of Health, Oman.Ã‚Â After identifying patients with pulmonary barotrauma, the following details were recorded and entered into an Excel sheet (Microsoft Corporation, Albuquerque, New Mexico) and a database was created, which contained the following: age, sex,Ã‚Â smoking history, comorbidities, type, location, mode of barotrauma, mode of ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, interventions performed, and overall outcome (survived/deceased). Results A total of 529 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted from March 2021 to September 2021 to the ICU. Twenty-eightÃ‚Â patients developed barotrauma of variable severity and required interventions like the placement of intercostal drains. Out of 28, five patients developed spontaneous barotrauma, 14 patients had barotrauma after initiation of non-invasive ventilation, and nine patients had barotrauma as a result of invasive ventilation. The median number of days in the ICU was 19.5 (interquartile range: 12.5-26.5). Of the 28 patients, eight patients survived and were discharged from the hospital. Conclusion In this single-center, retrospective study at a secondary care hospital in Oman, weÃ‚Â described our experience with patients who suffered pulmonary barotrauma during their ICU admission. We have also presented the incidence of spontaneous versus ventilator-induced barotrauma, the length of stay of these patients, the outcomes in terms of survival or death, the need for tracheostomy, secondary infections, and interventions performed as indicated.","Kajenthiran, Tiwary, Lal, Paul, Al Sawafi, Manhas, Yadav, Al Harthi, Nair","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.26414","20220801","ards (acute respiratory distress syndrome); covid-19; invasive mechanical ventilation; morbidity and mortality; pulmonary barotrauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35443,""
"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (CBT-ACT) vs Standard Care After Critical Illness Due to COVID-19: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Post-covid syndrome is an emerging condition involving a wide range of symptoms, including high rates of poor mental health. The diagnostic relevance and clinical severity of these symptoms are largely unknown, and evidence for treatment of post-covid mental health symptoms is lacking. This protocol describes a pilot randomized clinical trial, primarily aiming to assess feasibility, participant adherence and satisfaction in a novel phycho-therapeutic intervention on post-covid anxiety and depression symptoms Ã¢â€°Â¥1 year after critically ill COVID-19. Whether the intervention may generate improvements in post-covid depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) will be addressed in a following larger trial. A multicenter, investigator-initiated randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trial Identifier number NCT05119608) including Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-treated COVID-19 survivors, who display symptoms of anxiety and/or depression at follow-up 12 months after hospitalization (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Ã¢â€°Â¥8 for depression or anxiety). Eligible individuals are referred to a psychiatrist for structured diagnostic assessment and inclusion in the trial. Participants will be randomized to either a 10-week cognitive behavioral therapy intervention with added acceptance and commitment therapy (CBT-ACT) or standard care (primary care referral). Primary study outcome measure is feasibility and patient adherence, defined as the proportion of participants who consent to randomization and remain in the study including follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include reduced symptoms in the HADS depression/anxiety subscales, post-traumatic symptoms, HRQoL and user satisfaction at 3 months after the intervention. This protocol describes a pilot trial to assess feasibility and preliminary effects of a structured psycho-therapeutic intervention to ameliorate mental health in a population severely affected by COVID-19, where evidence for structured psycho-therapy is lacking.","HÃƒÂ¥kansson, Cronhjort, Lidin-Darlington, Lilja, Nilsson, Schandl, Friberg","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.907215","20220801","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; acceptance and commitment therapy; post-covid syndrome; randomized controlled trial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35444,""
"Attitudes toward innovative mental health treatment approaches in Germany: E-mental health and home treatment","E-mental health and home treatment are treatment approaches that have proven to be effective, but are only slowly implemented in the German health care system. This paper explores the attitudes toward these innovative treatment approaches. Data was collected in two large, non-clinical samples representative of the German population in spring 2020 (<i>N</i> = 2,503) and winter 2020/2021 (<i>N</i> = 2,519). Statistical associations between variables were examined using two-tailed tests. Binary and multinomial logistic regressions were performed to predict attitudes toward online-based treatment concepts and home treatment approaches. Only few (&lt;20%) people preferred online-based treatment approaches, while a larger proportion (~50%) could imagine being treated at home. Overall, younger subjects were more open to online-therapy approaches, while people with lower education preferred more often a traditional therapy setting. Acceptance of online-therapy did not raise significantly during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. When different online-based treatment options were available, the probability of accepting home treatment significantly increased with increasing levels of therapeutic support. Further promotion of acceptance for online-therapy and home treatment seems to be necessary. In the future, more information on innovative treatment approaches should be actively provided.","Lincke, Ulbrich, Reis, Wandinger, BrÃƒÂ¤hler, DÃƒÂ¼ck, KÃƒÂ¶lch","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.889555","20220801","acceptance of healthcare; attitudes toward healthcare; e-therapy; eHealth; online interventions; outreach care; preferences; representative survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35445,""
"A Critical Review of Text Mining Applications for Suicide Research","Applying text mining to suicide research holds a great deal of promise. In this manuscript, literature from 2019 to 2021 is critically reviewed for text mining projects that use electronic health records, social media data, and death records. Text mining has helped identify risk factors for suicide in general and specific populations (e.g., older adults), has been combined with structured variables in EHRs to predict suicide risk, and has been used to track trends in social media suicidal discourse following population level events (e.g., COVID-19, celebrity suicides). Future research should utilize text mining along with data linkage methods to capture more complete information on risk factors and outcomes across data sources (e.g., combining death records and EHRs), evaluate effectiveness of NLP-based intervention programs that use suicide risk prediction, establish standards for reporting accuracy of text mining programs to enable comparison across studies, and incorporate implementation science to understand feasibility, acceptability, and technical considerations.","Boggs, Kafka","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40471-022-00293-w","20220801","COVID-19; Suicide; Text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35446,""
"Emotional Contagion: Research on the Influencing Factors of Social Media Users' Negative Emotional Communication During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the epidemic, social media platforms were frequently used by users to express and spread negative emotions. Under emotional contagion, individual emotions gradually generalized into group emotions. At the same time, the public could not regulate their emotions and lacked access to release them rationally. This study explores the factors influencing the negative emotions' communication among social media users during the COVID-19 epidemic from the perspective of emotion contagion theory to discover the psychological mechanisms among the public. The questionnaire was tested for reliability and validity and then distributed online on Chinese social media platforms, and the data collected were statistically analyzed. The findings show that there are significant differences in negative emotional communication in social media among different age groups; the seven dimensions of deindividuation, risk perception, group identity, group efficacy, event stimulation, event publicness, and emotion contagion all have significant positive effects on users' negative emotional communication. This study aims to raise public awareness of negative emotions and promote the reconstruction and recovery of public mental health in the epidemic era.","Lu, Hong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.931835","20220801","emotion contagion theory; negative emotional communication; psychological mechanisms; social media; the COVID-19 epidemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35447,""
"Healthcare Worker Mental Health and Wellbeing During COVID-19: Mid-Pandemic Survey Results","HealthCare worker (HCW) mental health and wellbeing are uniquely affected by the complexities of COVID-19 due to exposure to the virus, isolation from family and friends, risk and uncertainty. Little if any inquiry has examined the effects on an entire healthcare system, particularly immediately post-surge. We sought to examine the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and behavioral health difficulties as a healthcare system transitioned out of the first wave. We assessed the effects of work role, setting and individual diversity factors on employee distress and coping strategies. This was an Institutional Review Board approved, unfunded, voluntary survey sent via REDCap link, to all employees of Hartford HealthCare, a mid-sized healthcare system (<i>N</i> Ã¢â€°Ë† 29,900) between May 15th and June 26th, 2020. Two system-wide emails and two emails targeting managers were sent during this time frame. Eight thousand four hundred and ninety four employees (28.4% of all e-mails distributed) participated in the survey, representing clinical, support, administrative, and medical staff across hospital, outpatient, residential, and business settings. The survey contained items assessing personal background, work environment/culture, and formal measures, including: patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), general anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), primary care post-traumatic stress disorder screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD), alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT-C), and the insomnia severity index (ISI). Almost 1/3 of respondents (31%) reported symptoms of clinically significant anxiety; 83% moderate to severe depression; and 51% moderate to severe insomnia. Thirteen percent screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder. Frontline staff (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001 vs. others) and females (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 vs. males) endorsed the highest levels of distress, while race (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.005) and ethnicity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.03 for anxiety, PTSD and insomnia) had a complex and nuanced interaction with symptoms. Pandemic stress effects all healthcare employees, though not equally. The effects of work role and environment are intuitive though critical. These data suggest individual diversity factors also play an important role in mental health and wellbeing. All must be considered to optimize employee functioning.","Young, Kolcz, Ferrand, O'Sullivan, Robinson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.924913","20220801","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; depression; diversity; healthcare worker (HCW); wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35448,""
"Alleviating Work Exhaustion, Improving Professional Fulfillment, and Influencing Positivity Among Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19: A Study on Sudarshan Kriya Yoga","Demanding work-life and excessive workload, the conflict between professional and personal lives, problems with patients and those related to the occurrence of death and high risk for their own life are a few factors causing burnout, disengagement, and dissatisfaction in the professional lives of healthcare professionals (HCPs). The situation worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is of utmost importance to find effective solutions to mitigate the stress and anxiety adversely affecting the mental well-being and professional lives of HCPs. This study was designed to examine the efficacy of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for alleviating work exhaustion, improving Professional Fulfillment, and influencing positivity among HCPs during COVID-19. In a comparative observation before the intervention (Pre), after the intervention (Post), and 30 days after the intervention (Day 30) in the Experimental Group (29 physicians) and Control Group (27 physicians), it was found that immediately after SKY, HCPs experienced a significant improvement in Professional Fulfillment (<i>p</i> = 0.009), work exhaustion (0.008), positive affect (<i>p</i> = 0.02), and negative affect (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared to the Control Group. The effect of SKY continued until Day 30 for Professional Fulfillment and had positive and negative effects. Findings suggest that SKY elevated Professional Fulfillment among HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced their work exhaustion and the negative effect on their mental health. SKY can aid HCPs in maintaining their well-being when faced with unprecedented challenges.","Kanchibhotla, Harsora, Gupte, Mehrotra, Sharma, Trehan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.670227","20220801","Sudarshan Kriya Yoga; healthcare professionals; mental wellbeing; negative affect; positive affect; professional fulfillment; work exhaustion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35449,""
"Global Research Mapping of Psycho-Oncology Between 1980 and 2021: A Bibliometric Analysis","Psycho-oncology is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative sub-specialty of oncology that focuses on the psychological, behavioral, ethical, and social aspects of cancer in clinical settings. The aim of this bibliometric study was to analyze and characterize the research productivity and trends in psycho-oncology between 1980 and 2021. In May 2022, the Scopus<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> database was searched for psycho-oncology-related publications using predetermined search keywords with specific restrictions. Lotka's law was applied to check the authors' productivity, while Bradford's law was used to assess the core journals in this field. The data was analyzed for different bibliometric indicators in the Biblioshiny package, an RStudio tool for bibliometric analysis. The initial search resulted in a total of 2,906 publications. Of which, 1,832 publications were included in the final analysis, published between 1980 and 2021. The analyzed publications were written by 7,363 authors from 74 countries and published in 490 journals. There has been a significant increase in psycho-oncology-related publications after 2010. The most productive year was 2021 (<i>n</i> = 365). The annual scientific growth rate was found to be 13.9%. The most relevant leading author in terms of publications was Luigi Grassi from the University of Ferrara, Italy (<i>n</i> = 42). Lotka's law found that the number of authors declined as the number of papers written increased. The core journals were Psycho-Oncology, Supportive Care in Cancer, and Journal of Psychosocial Oncology. The most frequently used author's keywords other than searching keywords were cancer, oncology, quality of life, depression, and anxiety. Recent psycho-oncology-related topics included mental health, COVID-19 infection in humans, people, pandemic, and tumor. The University of Sydney was the top-ranked institution. The leading country in terms of publications, citations, corresponding author country, and international collaboration was the United States of America (United States). The United States had the strongest collaboration with Australia and Canada. The research hotspots include mental health conditions and interventions in cancer patients. We identified international collaboration and research expenditure to be strongly associated with psycho-oncology research productivity.

"COVID-19 related stressors and mental health outcomes of expatriates in international construction","The construction industry is labor-intensive, and employees' mental health has a significant impact on occupational health and job performance. In particular, expatriates in international projects under the normalization of the epidemic are under greater pressure than domestic project employees. This paper aims to explore the association of stressors and mental health in international constructions during COVID-19. Furthermore, test the mediation effect of psychological resilience and moderating effort of international experience in this relationship. A survey of 3,091 expatriates in international construction projects was conducted. A moderating mediation model was employed to test the effect of psychological resilience and international experience. Then, statistical analysis with a bootstrap sample was used to test the mediation effect of the model, and a simple slope was used to test the moderating effect. Moderated by experience, the slope of the effect of stressors on psychological resilience changed from -1.851 to -1.323. And the slope of the effect of psychological resilience on mental health outcomes reduced by about 0.1. This suggests that experience is one of the buffering factors for individual psychological resilience of expatriates to regulate stress. Theoretically, this study verifies the mediation effect of psychological resilience between COVID-19 related stressors and mental health outcomes and importance of an expatriate's experience in an international assignment. Practically, this study provides guidelines for international construction enterprises and managers to make an assistant plan for expatriates during this pandemic time and pay more attention to their psychological status. The research also suggests that the best choice for challenging assignments is choosing a more experienced employee.","Gao, Deng, Yang, Fang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.961726","20220801","COVID-19 related stressors; expatriates; international assignments experience; international construction; mental health; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35451,""

The primary aim of this study was to explore the effects of an online mindfulness program on resiliency in health care workers during the pandemic using a mixed-methods approach. An online 4-week mindfulness program was delivered to healthcare workers (<i>N</i> = 130) in Ontario, Canada. Resiliency was assessed at 3-time points (i.e., pre, post, and 1-month follow-up), and the mindfulness program's efficacy on resiliency was analyzed using linear regression. Semi-structured interviews (<i>N</i> = 10) were conducted to substantiate their experiences. Healthcare workers' resiliency significantly increased after the mindfulness program compared to the baseline, maintaining the effect after 1 month in both unadjusted and adjusted regression models. These findings were further bolstered by the positive experiences shared by participants highlighting the program's efficacy on empathy and resiliency. Evidence suggests that mindfulness is associated with promoting resiliency in healthcare workers and may be an important strategy to promote resiliency in this population.","Kim, Crawford, Hunter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.907528","20220801","COVID-19; healthcare workers; mindfulness; online delivery; resiliency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35452,""
"Politics, Pandemics, and Trauma: Understanding and Addressing Latino Health Needs Through a Culturally-Informed Lens","Latino communities in the United States (U.S.) have long endured trauma due to multiple intersecting social and political forces. New restrictive immigration policies since 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic have each created novel stressors for Latino communities, while escalating the risk of mental health disorders and highlighting the communities' vulnerabilities. The effects of these stressors have been particularly pronounced in southeastern states, such as Tennessee and Georgia, due to their state-level anti-immigrant legislation. Yet, we lack sufficient data to understand how these factors present among Latinos seeking services. To focus attention on the specific experiences of Latino communities living in the U.S. Southeast, the authors analyzed the perspectives of 44 service providers working with these communities in the region using qualitative data collected in an online survey administered during the COVID-19 pandemic and while President Trump's exclusionary immigration policies were in force. Four themes were identified: (1) Latino communities' strengths; (2) impact of the Trump administration on Latino communities; (3) impact of COVID-19's on Latino communities; and (4) strategies to enhance service delivery in Latino communities. Results provide meaningful data to inform micro- and macro-level service delivery in two exclusionary policy states and beyond. Findings suggest future research should include other new immigrant destinations and explore perceptions of Latino community members.","Held, Villarreal-OtÃƒÂ¡lora, McPherson, Jennings-McGarity","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.877328","20220801","COVID-19; Latino immigrant communities; Southeastern U.S; immigration policies; service provision; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35453,""
"The Effect of Regional Factors on the Mental Health Status of Frontline Nurses and Patients With COVID-19 During COVID-19: The Role of Depression and Anxiety","At the end of 2019, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, experienced the ravages of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a few months, infected people rose to tens of thousands. This study aimed to explore the mental health status of military nurse personnel assisting (non-Hubei area) in the fight against COVID-19 and local nurse personnel (in the Wuhan area), as well as the differences in mental health status between nurses and COVID-19 patients that provide a reference basis for psychological crisis intervention. A convenience sampling method was used to select frontline nurses and COVID-19 patients (sample size 1,000+) from two mobile cabin hospitals from January to March 2020. The questionnaire consists of socio-demographic information, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), General Mental Health Service Questionnaire and Work Intensity and Physical Status Questionnaire. The results showed that depression was present in 117 nurses (19.73%) and 101 patients (23.33%) with PHQ-9 scores &gt;10; anxiety was present in 60 nurses (10.12%) and 54 patients (12.47%) with GAD-7 &gt;10. The anxiety and depression levels of nurses in Wuhan area were higher than those in non-Hubei area. The differences in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were also statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) when comparing patients from different regions, with anxiety and depression rates of 30.19 and 16.04% in local patients and 16.74 and 9.50% in foreign patients. The comparison between nurses and patients showed that the nurses were more depressed than the patients, while the patients were more anxious. Local nurses in Wuhan had a higher workload intensity than aid nurses (77.72 vs. 57.29%). Over 95% of frontline nurses and patients reported that they had not received any form of psychological counseling before the COVID-19 outbreak. 12.87% (26/194) of frontline nurses in Wuhan had a history of taking hypnotic drugs. However, fewer patients (16/212, 7.55%) took medication than frontline nurses. Anxiety and depression levels were far higher among local nurses and patients in Wuhan than in non-Hubei areas. The nurses had higher levels of depression, while the patients had higher anxiety levels.

The current work aims to describe the design, methods, and descriptive information at recruitment and preliminary findings of the Chilean Maternal &amp; Infant Cohort Study II (CHiMINCs-II) cohort. The CHiMINCs-II is an ongoing cohort that is part of the Chilean Maternal and Infant Nutrition Observatory of the South-East area of Santiago, Chile. In total, 1954 pregnant women beneficiaries of the public health systems and their offspring were recruited before 15 weeks of gestation and are followed across pregnancy (&lt;15, 26-28, and 35-37 weeks of gestation) and up to 2 years of age in their offspring. Two studies are currently nested within the CHiMINCs-II cohort: (1) Breast Cancer Risk Assessment in Mothers (BRECAM) study, and (2) the CHiMINCs-COVID study. The primary objective of BRECAM study is to test the association between maternal metabolic indicators (i.e., insulin, glucose, insulin growth factor 1, and hemoglobin A1c concentrations) at early pregnancy (i.e., &lt;15 and 26-28 weeks of gestation) and breast density 3 months after the cessation of lactation. For this purpose, we collect maternal obstetric, lifestyle, dietary intake, anthropometric, and biochemical information. The aim of the CHiMINCs-COVID study is to assess maternal dietary intake and mental health problems derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and their association with maternal and infant's health and nutrition. Thus, we collected detailed information on dietary behaviors, mental health, and COVID-related information at each trimester, along with neonatal and infant nutritional information. The findings of this study will provide novel and critical information to better understand maternal nutritional status, mental health, as well as infant growth and nutrition during the COVID-19 era.

"Examining the Mental Health, Wellbeing, Work Participation and Engagement of Medical Laboratory Professionals in Ontario, Canada: An Exploratory Study","The overall objective of this proposed project is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health, functioning and wellbeing of medical laboratory technologists (MLT) and medical laboratory technicians/assistants (MLT/A) in Ontario, Canada. A cross-sectional study included a self-reported questionnaire for MLT and MLT/A in Ontario. The questionnaire included questions about demographics and occupational characteristics. Questions about mental health, functioning, well-being and psychosocial work environments were also included using validated questionnaires. There were 551 MLT and 401 MLT/A in the analytic sample. Most of the respondents were women. The mean age and standard deviation of the overall sample were 42.0 Ã‚Â± 11.8. MLT demonstrated higher quantitative demands, possibilities for development, and organizational justice compared to MLT/A. The scores of work pace, emotional demands, role conflicts, job insecurity, insecurity over working conditions and negative acts were higher for MLT/A than MLT. The WHODAS 2.0 scores of the respondents were 20.80 Ã‚Â± 6.68, higher than approximately 92% average people. For both groups, most respondents scored the COPSOQ-III domains as worse since COVID-19. The study provides preliminary evidence regarding the workplace mental health outcomes of medical laboratory professionals in Ontario, Canada. The findings suggest that MLT and MLT/A experience psychosocial work conditions that impact mental health, functioning and disability. Accordingly, additional research is necessary to understand the experiences of medical laboratory professionals.","Nowrouzi-Kia, Dong, Gohar, Hoad","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.876883","20220801","Canada; medical laboratory assistants/technicians; medical laboratory professionals; medical laboratory technologists; mental health; occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35456,""
"Sleep Quality Impairment Is Associated With Pandemic Attitudes During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Circuit Breaker Lockdown in England: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with sleep quality impairment and psychological distress, and the general public has responded to the pandemic and quarantine requirements in a variety of ways. We aimed to investigate whether sleep quality is low during a short-term (circuit break) quarantine restriction, and whether sleep quality is associated with respondents' overall attitudes to the pandemic using a validated scale. Online cross-sectional study in England in November 2020. The study included 502 respondents over the age of 18. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and pandemic attitudes were assessed using the Oxford Pandemic Attitudes Scale-COVID-19 (OPAS-C), a validated 20-item, 7-domain scale that assesses pandemic-related stress, fear, loneliness, sense of community, sense of exaggerated concern, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and vaccine hesitancy. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression odds ratios of association were assessed between the dependent variable of poor sleep quality (PSQI&gt;5) and risk factors, including OPAS-C score, age, sex, educational status, and income. The mean (SD) PSQI score was 7.62 (3.49). Overall, 68.9% of respondents met criteria for poor sleep quality using the PSQI cutoff of &gt;5. The mean (SD) OPAS-C score was 60.3 (9.1). There was a significantly increased odds of poor sleep quality in the highest vs. lowest OPAS-C quartiles (OR 4.94, 95% CI [2.67, 9.13], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Age, sex, income, political leaning, employment status, and education attainment were not associated with poor sleep quality. More than two-thirds of respondents met criteria for poor sleep quality. The odds of poor sleep quality increased in a dose-response relationship with pandemic attitudes (such as higher levels of pandemic-related stress, fear, or loneliness). The association between poor sleep quality and pandemic attitudes suggests opportunities for public health and sleep medicine interventions, and highlights the need for further research.","Kantor, Kantor, Fortgang, Pace-Schott","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.819231","20220801","COVID-19; OPAS-C; mental health; pandemic (COVID-19); sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35457,""
"Afghan Health Related Concerns Following the US Withdrawal: Results of a Survey Given <i>via</i> Social Media","The United States Armed Forces completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30th, 2021, ending 20 years of war in Afghanistan. This rapid timeline from announcement to withdrawal and subsequent power transfer had profound consequences on the Afghan people, particularly in the domains of health and healthcare. On 15 September 2021, we posted an anonymous online cross-sectional survey on social media (Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp groups) to collect data about respondents from Afghanistan. Questions focused on COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and individual care with a focus on changes related to the United States (US) withdrawal from Afghanistan. The form was composed of 17 questions which included multiple choice, single choice, and numeric options. All questions were optional including demographic data. Our survey yielded 1,074 responses from the Farsi version and 572 responses from the Pashto version for a total of 1,646 responses. 1,286 (80%) of respondents were in Afghanistan at the time of survey submission. Concerning the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, 26% (412) respondents were extremely concerned and 12% (181) were moderately concerned. A majority of respondents report concerns regarding mental health due to the US withdrawal. 27% (418) report extreme concern, 12% (186) report moderate concern, and 15% (229) report a little concern. There is a significant difference in the proportions of concern (for US withdrawal generally, as well as physical and mental health) across gender. 49% of Female respondents report extreme concern regarding the US withdrawal compared to 22% of Male respondents (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). With respect to physical health concerns 36% of Females report extreme concern compared to 16% of Males (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Finally on the mental health concerns, 54% of Females report extreme concern compared to 22% of Males (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The results from this survey are susceptible to the possibility of internal validity and/or external validity. However, we are accepting of those possibilities considering this survey wasn't designed to be bulletproof, but rather serve as a voice for those who can't be heard and to inform the public of the hardships occurring across the globe due to a steadfast retraction of the US footprint from their soil. Our findings indicate salient changes and public health concerns among Afghans following the US withdrawal from the region. These concerns varied across gender and ethnic groups. Our findings may serve as the first step in addressing the health concerns of Afghans following two decades of US military presence. The results should be understood through the limitations associated with a survey study design. Future research and policy aimed at tackling short and long-term health and social concerns in Afghanistan should consider the role of US withdrawal.","Shah, Shah, Tokhi, Shedrow, Hernandez, Varney, Qaderi, Masoumi, Qaderi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.905481","20220801","Afghanistan; US withdrawal; concerns; mental health; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35458,""

"Prevalence of Anxiety among Qassim university female medical students during Covid-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia","Anxiety disorders are common but under-recognized psychiatric disorders. The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of anxiety and factors associated with anxiety during the Covid 19 pandemic among female medical students at Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. An online cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered questionnaire, was conducted from August to December 2021. The questionnaire using Google Forms, submitted to the WhatsApp groups of female medical students, gathered personal data and information related to the Covid19 pandemic effects. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used for measuring the severity of anxiety. Out of 278 invited students, 179 responded (response rate: 64.4%). Mean age of the respondents was 22.45 (Ã‚Â±1.57) years, 89.9% were living with their parents, and 46.9% perceived their academic performance as 'Good'. A total of 34 (19%) suffered from COVID-19, and 50.3% (n=90) of students reported family members affected by COVID-19, and 24.4% of the affected family members were hospitalized. The prevalence of anxiety among study participants was 26.8% (n=48); 31 (17.3%) participants had moderate and 17 (9.5%) had severe anxiety. The overall median anxiety score was 11 (IQR=21).

"Longitudinal changes in fear and anxiety among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a one-year follow-up study","There is growing evidence that levels of fear and anxiety have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given regular epidemic prevention and control measures, longitudinal changes and causal factors in the incidence of fear and anxiety need to be measured and explored. College students completed online surveys in two wave studies a year apart. The participants who completed both of the surveys numbered 22,578. The online surveys were completed at the pandemic's normalization/prevention stage (T1, from June 1 to 15, 2020) and during a phase of new local transmission of the disease in Guangdong Province (T2, from June 10 to 18, 2021). Multiple linear regressions were used to examine fear and anxiety predictors from demographic characteristics. Fear related to COVID-19 had significantly decreased at T2 (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°66.64, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), however, anxiety had significantly increased at T2 (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-5.03, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In particular, not implementing preventive measures (e.g., handwashing) during the COVID-19 pandemic had the greatest impact in predicting the change in fear levels. By contrast, prior poor mental health status contributed the most in predicting the change in degree of anxiety. These results suggest different changes in anxiety levels (deterioration) and degree of fear (mitigation) occurred as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. These findings have implications for planning mental health crisis provisions and have long-term impact beyond this pandemic.","Peng, Liu, Liang, Chen, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03487-z","20220801","Anxiety; COVID-19; College students; Fear; Longitudinal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35462,""

The study included 111 healthcare employees and 222 non-healthcare workers between the ages of 18 and 65 who applied to the hospital. For some reason, no one was excluded from the research. Socio-demographic and lifestyle-related questions, depression, anxiety, work-social adjustment scores, and pandemic-social status-operation connections were all assessed using a self-report questionnaire containing psychometric measures. the mean age of the participants in the study was 33.67Ã‚Â±10.01 and 59% of the participants were female.

"Medical student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, medical students exhibited poorer mental health relative to the general population and other students. This research aimed to assess American medical student mental health during the pandemic's height, while also identifying stressors and vulnerable populations. In this cross-sectional study, 960 US allopathic and osteopathic medical students completed a mental health survey screening for depression, anxiety, burnout, suicidal ideation and increased substance use during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential relationships were explored between these mental health indicators and demographic and environmental factors, such as COVID-19 exposure. Of the 960 medical students surveyed, 25.1% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°241) screened positive for depression, 40.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°388) screened positive for anxiety, 21.3% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°201) met criteria for at least one dimension of burnout, 19.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°182) started or increased substance use and 7.2% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°69) experienced thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Significant differences (pÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.01) in measures of mental health were associated with those who had accessed mental health care, had a personal COVID-19 diagnosis, knew someone who died of COVID-19 or were female. Although rates of anxiety and substance use among medical students in our study were higher than previously reported, rates of burnout and thoughts of self-harm or suicide were surprisingly lower. These results indicate that some aspects of remote learning imposed by the pandemic could be protective, warranting additional study for post-pandemic medical education. Meanwhile, medical schools and clerkships should offer additional resources to students particularly vulnerable to stressors, including females and those with personal pandemic impacts.","Jupina, Sidle, Rehmeyer Caudill","https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13518","20220801","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35465,""
"Behavioural adaptations and responses to obstetric care among pregnant women during an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong: a cross-sectional survey","This study evaluated behavioural adaptations and responses to obstetric care among pregnant women during an early stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This cross-sectional survey included pregnant women who received obstetric care from 27 May 2020 to 16 June 2020 in a university-affiliated hospital in Hong Kong. Responses were collected with respect to obstetric appointment scheduling, workplace changes, mask-wearing practices, travel and quarantine experiences, obstetric service adjustments, and visiting arrangements. Regression analysis was used to compare the effects of patient characteristics on their responses. In total, 1000 surveys were distributed; 733 pregnant women provided complete survey responses. Among obstetric-related appointments in public hospitals, 16% were postponed or cancelled by pregnant women; such changes were most frequent among women beyond 24 weeks of gestation, women who had previous deliveries, and women who had a history of mental illness. The practice of working from home imposed psychological stress and negatively impacted the pregnancy experience in 4.5% of women. Childbirth companionship was regarded as an important service by 88.1% of women; only 4.2% agreed with its suspension. Obstetric service adjustments had the greatest impact on Chinese women and nulliparous women. The findings provide an overview of how pregnant women adapted during an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Women adjusted obstetric service attendance, began working from home, and wore masks. Women's expectations did not match changes in childbirth companionship and peripartum services. Hospital administrators should consider psychological impacts on pregnant women when implementing service adjustments.","Hui, Seto, Cheung","https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj209032","20220801","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Postpartum period; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35466,""

"The associations among psychological distress, stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic, and disinhibited eating of parents of three- to five-year-old children","Individuals' psychological distress is associated with disinhibited eating (external and emotional eating). The aim of the current study was to examine the moderating associations of COVID-19-related stress on parents' psychological distress (anxiety, hostility, depression) and external and emotional eating. One hundred and sixty U.S. parents of three- to five-year-old children (M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 34.08, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.76; 89 females) completed an online survey. After accounting for participant characteristics (i.e., age, BMI, sex), regression analyses showed that COVID-19 stress moderated the effects of anxiety, hostility, and depression on external eating. Additionally, findings showed that COVID-19 stress moderated hostility (but not anxiety or depression) on emotional eating. These findings suggest that unexpected stressors from the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate disinhibited eating among those individuals who experience psychological distress. This presents support for providing interventions that focus on healthy coping strategies and family well-being, support groups, and community resources (e.g., financial assistance) to alleviate external pressures during unprecedented times.","Herzog, Sherrard, Kemmerley, Tan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2022.101654","20220731","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Emotional eating; External eating; Hostility; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35469,""
"Virtual individual cognitive stimulation therapy in Hong Kong: A mixed methods feasibility study","We aimed to translate and culturally adapt Virtual Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (V-iCST) for the Hong Kong (HK) Chinese population, and to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability. A mixed methods case series (N=8) was used to assess the feasibility of V-iCST and changes in cognition, quality of life (QoL), mood, and communication pre and post-test. Data were analyzed with the reliable change index. Thematic analysis of post-therapy interviews and content analysis of session rating forms were used to evaluate the acceptability. V-iCST was feasible with low attrition (0%) and high attendance (100%). Participants had reliable improvements in all outcomes. Six had improved and stable cognition; four had clinically significant changes in depression. There were no reliable changes in QoL. Qualitative analyses indicated V-iCST as acceptable but required assistance. V-iCST can be adapted for HK Chinese with dementia and potentially improve cognition, QoL, mood, and communication.","Hui, Wong, Tischler, Yuan, Leung, Saunders, Suen, Spector","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2022.07.010","20220731","Aging; COVID-19; Chinese; Dementia; Mixed methods; Older adults; Psychosocial interventions; Teletherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35470,""
"The reliability of symptom assessment by telepsychiatry compared with face to face psychiatric interviews","With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the various social distancing policies imposed have mandated psychiatrists to consider the option of using telepsychiatry as an alternative to face-to-face interview in Hong Kong. Limitations over sample size, methodology and information technology were found in previous studies and the reliability of symptoms assessment remained a concern. To evaluate the reliability of assessment of psychiatric symptoms by telepsychiatry comparing with face-to-face psychiatric interview. This study recruited a sample of adult psychiatric patients in psychiatric wards in Queen Mary Hospital. Semi-structural interviews with the use of standardized psychiatric assessment scales were carried out in telepsychiatry and face-to-face interview respectively by two clinicians and the reliability of psychiatric symptoms elicited were assessed. 90 patients completed the assessments The inter-method reliability in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale showed good agreement when compared with face-to-face interview. Symptoms assessment by telepsychiatry is comparable to assessment conducted by face-to-face interview.","Yung, Yeung, Law","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114728","20220731","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35471,""

The goal of our research is to analyze the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on the Hungarian population over 60 years of age. We collected data using the authentic Hungarian translation of the ""World-Wide FINGERS SARS-CoV-2 Survey"" between 1st of February and 1st of June 2021. Our study included 431 people with a low rate of COVID infection (6%). The most marked changes were the increase in the use of digital services in 71%, increased feeling of loneliness in 46%, decrease in subjective sleep quality in 47%, and reduced contact with friends and relatives in 80% of the respondents. Eight-six percent of participants had at least one chronic illness and 23% missed an illness-related medical visit during the pandemic. In 45%, the subjective quality of life deteriorated and 25% reported impairment of memory functions. Participants became socially isolated during the pandemic having a significant negative impact on their way of life. The changes in physical and mental health are likely to be reflected in an increased incidence and accelerated progression of age-related diseases in the elderly. In order to reduce the direct and indirect harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to know how the pandemic and the following restrictions affect the behavior and lifestyle of the elderly as well as the care of patients living with chronic diseases.

"Developmental Trajectories of Temperament from Late Childhood through Adolescence and Associations with Anxiety and Depression in Young Adulthood","Anxiety and depression are pervasive and pernicious mental health problems for young adults. Developmental trajectories of adolescent temperament (Effortful Control, Negative Emotionality, Positive Emotionality) may help us predict who will experience anxiety/depression during young adulthood. The present study uses longitudinal data from a large, community sample of Mexican-origin youth (N = 674), to examine how temperament develops across adolescence (age 10 to 16) and whether the developmental trajectories of temperament are associated with anxiety/depression during young adulthood (ages 19 and 21). Results indicate that Effortful Control, Negatively Emotionality, and the Affiliation facet of Positive Emotionality tend to decrease across adolescence, whereas Surgency tends to increase. Greater increases in Effortful Control and Positive Emotionality across adolescence are associated with fewer anxiety/depression symptoms during young adulthood, whereas greater increases in Negative Emotionality are associated with more anxiety/depression symptoms later on. Thus, temperament development serves as both a protective factor (Effortful Control, Positive Emotionality) and a risk factor (Negative Emotionality) for later anxiety/depression in Mexican-origin youth.","Katherine M.

"Risk and protective factors for new onset binge eating, low weight, and self-harm symptoms in >25,000 individuals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with poor mental health, including increases in eating disorder and self-harm symptoms. We investigated risk and protective factors for new onset of these symptoms during the pandemic. Method: Data were from the COVID-19 Psychiatry and Neurological Genetics study and the Repeated Assessment of Mental health in Pandemics Study (n = 45,058). Exposures were socio-demographic characteristics, lifetime psychiatric disorder, and COVID-related variables, including SARS-CoV-2 infection/illness with COVID-19. We identified four sub-samples of participants without pre-pandemic experience of our outcomes: binge eating (n = 18,172), low weight (n = 19,148), suicidal and/or self-harm ideation (n = 12,650), and self-harm (n = 20,266). Participants reported on our outcomes at frequent intervals (fortnightly to monthly). We fitted four logistic regression models to identify factors associated with new onset of our outcomes. Results: Within each subsample, new onset was reported by: 16.9% for binge eating, 8.9% for low weight, 26.6% for suicidal and/or self-harm ideation, and 3.3.% for self-harm. Shared risk factors included having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, not being in paid employment, and higher pandemic worry scores. Conversely, infection with SARS-CoV-2/illness with COVID-19 was linked to lower odds of all outcomes. Other factors were associated with one outcome, such as pandemic-related loneliness with suicidal and/or self-harm ideation. Discussion: Overall, we detected shared risk factors that may drive the comorbidity between eating disorders and self-harm. Subgroups of individuals with these risk factors may require more frequent monitoring during future pandemics.","Helena L Davies et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E000B-031-DC0","20220802","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Feeding and Eating Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; psychiatric disorders; eating disorders; suicidal ideation; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35474,""
"College, Interrupted: Profiles in First-Year College Students Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic Across One Year","First-year college students in the 2019-2020 academic year are at risk of having their mental health, identity work, and college careers derailed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess emerging and evolving impacts of the pandemic on mental health/well-being, identity development, and academic resilience, we collected data from a racially, ethnically, geographically, and economically diverse group of 629 students at 4 universities across the US within weeks of lockdown, and then followed up on these studentsâ€™ self-reported mental health, identity, and academic resilience three times over the following year. Our findings suggest that: 1) studentsâ€™ mental health, identity development, and academic resilience were largely negatively impacted compared to pre-pandemic samples; 2) these alterations persisted and, in some cases, worsened as the pandemic wore on; and 3) patterns of change were often worse for students indicating more baseline COVID-related stressors.","Monisha Pasupathi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E013E-65C-8DD","20220801","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Self-concept and Identity; well-being; academic success; mental health; covid; identity; college students","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-02","",35475,""
