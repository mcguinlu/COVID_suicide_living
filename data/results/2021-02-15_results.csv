"Emotional Reactivity and Wellbeing of Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Short and Long Term Effects and The Impact of Social and Socioeconomic Stressors","Adolescence is a formative period for socio-emotional development which is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal study examined the impact of the pandemic on young peopleâ€™s mood, emotional reactivity, and wellbeing (i.e., operationalized as balancing needs of self and others). Hence, we conducted an online two-week daily diary study among 462 Dutch adolescents (Mage = 15.27 years, 64% females) and 371 young adults (Mage = 21.49 years, 81% females) in May 2020, with a follow-up to study long-term effects in November 2020 (N = 238 and 231, respectively adolescents and young adults). In May 2020, young adults and older relative to younger adolescents showed higher levels and more fluctuations in tension and depression and lower levels of vigor. Vigor levels decreased and tension and depression levels increased between May 2020 and November 2020, especially for younger adolescents. A closer examination in the adolescent sample, revealed positive associations between instability of negative emotions (i.e. tension and depression fluctuations) and the exposure to social and socioeconomic stressors (i.e. family stress and inequality of online homeschooling). Together, this study demonstrates vulnerability regarding young peopleâ€™s mood and emotional reactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for adolescents who experience more stressors.","Kayla Green et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-D6E-037","20210215","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; adolescence; covid-19; young adulthood; family; emotional reactvity; socioeconomic stressors; wellbeing; mood","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-15","",10730,""
