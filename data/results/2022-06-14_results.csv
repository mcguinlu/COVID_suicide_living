"Online dashboards for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater data need standard best practices: an environmental health communication agenda","The rapid development of scientific communication approaches for environmental surveillance data with online information dashboards has been done in the absence of a global organizing body during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We aim to make a case for standardization of dashboards presenting SARS-CoV-2 wastewater data. The list of dashboards was compiled as of March 31, 2022. The 127 dashboards reviewed represented 27 countries using a range of line/bar graphs, maps, and tables with symbol presentation. We identified 96 separate units of measure for the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data. There was also inconsistency in using linear or log scale. Twenty-five percent of dashboards presented SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring. Only 30% (38/125) of dashboards provided downloadable source data. There is great opportunity to improve scientific communication though the adoption of uniform data presentation conventions or standards for this field.","Colleen C Naughton; Rochelle H Holm; Brooklyn P James; Ted R Smith","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.08.22276124","20220613","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32725,""
"Media coverage and speculation about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide: A content analysis of UK news","Rationale: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been much concern and speculation about rises in suicide rates, despite evidence that suicides did not in fact increase in the first year of the pandemic in most countries with real-time suicide data. This public narrative is potentially harmful, as well as misleading, and is likely to be perpetuated by sensational news coverage. Method: We conducted a systematic analysis of UK news coverage (including opinion pieces) on the impact of COVID-19 on suicidality, to examine the content and quality of such reporting as the pandemic developed, and as different coronavirus restrictions were imposed. Results: We identified 372 stories about COVID-19 and suicidality in online and print news between the first UK lockdown (March 2020) and May 2021 (when restrictions were significantly eased in the UK). Throughout this period, over a third of articles (39.2%) and headlines (41.4%) claimed or predicted a rise in suicide, often attributed to feelings of entrapment and poor mental health (especially amongst young people), and fueled by expert commentary and speculation. Almost a third of reports were rated as being of poor overall quality (116, 31.2%), and at least half included no signposting to help and support. However, reporting improved in phases of less stringent COVID-19 restrictions and over time, with later articles and headlines including fewer negative statements and predictions about rises in suicides, and greater reliance on academic evidence. Conclusions: As the longer-term consequences of the pandemic develop, and other national and global events unfold, it is increasingly important that the media, and the wider community of experts shaping its narratives, strive for a positive and evidence-informed approach to news coverage of suicide.","Lisa Marzano; Monica Hawley; Lorna Fraser; Yasmine Lainez; James Marsh; Keith Hawton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.10.22275998","20220613","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32726,""
"Addressing the Treatment and Service Needs of Young Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a complex period in which multiple changes take place (education, work, independent living, and social relations). This stage is especially difficult for adolescents suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who have to move on from child and adolescent mental health services to adult mental health services. This review analyzes developmental and environmental risk and protective factors as well as critical variables such as executive functioning and self-monitoring that influence the course of ADHD in transitional age youth and guide the priorities for an optimal transition of care. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic is also discussed. We reflect on the unmet needs for an optimal transition of care and propose practice and policy recommendations to achieve this goal.","Quintero, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Quiroga, ÃƒÂlvarez-Mon, Mora, Rostain","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chc.2022.03.007","20220613","ADHD; Atomoxetine; Guanfacine; Lisdexamfetamine; Methylphenidate; Nonstimulants; Stimulants; Transition of care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32727,""

"Digital Screening and Automated Resource Identification System to Address COVID-19-Related Behavioral Health Disparities: Feasibility Study","Digital mental health (DMH) tools use technology (e.g., websites, mobile apps) to conveniently deliver mental health resources to users in real-time, reducing access barriers. Underserved communities facing healthcare provider shortages and limited mental health resources may benefit from DMH tools, as these tools can help improve access to resources. The current study described the development and feasibility evaluation of the Emotional Needs Evaluation and Resource Guide for You (ENERGY) System, a DMH tool to meet the mental health and resource needs of youth and their families developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ENERGY System offers a brief assessment of resource needs; problem-solving capabilities; and symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma, and alcohol/substance use followed by automated, personalized feedback based on the participant's responses. Individuals aged 15 years and older were recruited through community partners, community events, targeted electronic health record messages, and social media. Participants completed screening questions to establish eligibility, entered demographic information, and completed the ENERGY System assessment. Based on the participant's responses, the ENERGY System immediately delivered digital resources tailored to their identified areas of need (e.g., relaxation). A subset of participants also voluntarily completed the following: COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) or COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA); resource needs assessment; and feedback on their experience using the ENERGY System. If resource needs (e.g., housing, food insecurity) were endorsed, lists of local resources were provided. A total of 212 individuals accessed the ENERGY System link; 96 (45.3%) individuals completed the screening tool and 89 (40.6%) received resources. Participant responses on the mental health screener questions triggered on average two intervention domains (M = 2.04, SD = 1.94). Behavioral Activation/Increasing Activities was the most frequently launched intervention domain (56.3%) and domains related to alcohol or substance use were the least common (4.2%). The most frequently requested support areas were finances (33.3%), transportation (26.0%), and food (24.0%). The CEFIS and CEFIS-AYA indicated higher than average impacts from the pandemic (i.e., average scores &gt; 2.5). Participants were satisfied with the ENERGY System overall (65%) as well as the length of time it took to answer the questions (90%), which they found easy to answer (87%). The current study provided initial support for the feasibility of the ENERGY System, a DMH tool capable of screening for resource and mental health needs, and providing automated and personalized free of cost resources and techniques to meet the identified needs. Future studies should seek direct feedback from community members to further improve the ENERGY System and dissemination to encourage use.","Stiles-Shields, Batts, Reyes, Archer, Crosby, Draxler, Lennan, Held","https://doi.org/10.2196/38162","20220613","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32729,""
"Post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and related factors among COVID-19 patients during the fourth wave of the pandemic in Vietnam","This study investigated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and their related factors among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients during the fourth wave of the pandemic in Vietnam. Vietnamese-fluent confirmed COVID-19 patients for at least 3Ã‚Â d were recruited in this online cross-sectional study to answer a three-part questionnaire including participants' sociodemographic characteristics, PTSD (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Associated factors were determined using multivariable binary logistic regression models. Of 1544 responses, the majority were female (53.0%), ages 18-39Ã‚Â y (74.8%) and were isolated and treated at field hospitals (72.2%). Family or friends were the greatest sources of mental support (68.2%), followed by healthcare providers (51.1%). The overall prevalence rates of PTSD, anxiety and depression among COVID-19 patients were 22.9%, 11.2% and 17.4%, respectively. Risk factors included older age, higher education, getting infected from the public, knowing someone who died from COVID-19 and high perception of life threat. Meanwhile, mental assistance from family or friends, a greater number of supporters, living with someone not vulnerable and higher salaries were significantly protective factors.

"Mental health impact on healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a US cross-sectional survey study","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health and well-being of health care workers (HCWs). This study examined mental health outcomes and COVID-related stress impacts among a diverse sample of ambulatory HCWs, including clinicians and support staff, as well as the associations between mental health outcomes and work impairments in this population. Detailing these results can help in designing interventions to alleviate this burden. ""The Health Care Worker Stress Survey"" was administered to ambulatory care providers and support staff at three multispecialty care delivery organizations as part of an online, cross-sectional study conducted between June 8, 2020, and July 13, 2020. The greatest stress impact reported by HCWs was the uncertainty regarding when the COVID-19 outbreak would be under control, while the least reported concern was about self-dying from COVID-19. Differences in COVID-19 stress impacts were observed by age, gender, and occupational risk factors. Approximately 50% of participants reported more than a minimal level of anxiety, including 22.5% who indicated moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Higher levels of anxiety were observed with younger ages and female gender, while occupational roles with increased exposure risk did not report higher levels of anxiety. Roughly two-thirds of the sample reported less than good sleep quality and one-third to one-half of the sample reported other sleep related problems that differed by age and gender. Role limitations due to emotional health correlated with COVID-19 related stress, anxiety and sleep problems. Using established, validated measures, we quantified mental health outcomes within a diverse sample of ambulatory care HCWs during the pandemic. Younger and female HCWs reported greater anxiety burden; HCWs with higher occupational risk of COVID exposure did not report higher levels of anxiety. Notable proportions of HCWs reported sleep and work impairments. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, it is difficult to attribute these patterns to the pandemic. These results underscore the depth and extent of mental health outcomes in HCWs in ambulatory settings and raise important questions on new interventions to relieve that burden. Further research is needed to study specific interventions to support the mental health and wellbeing of HCWs.","Biber, Ranes, Lawrence, Malpani, Trinh, Cyders, English, Staub, McCausland, Kosinski, Baranwal, Berg, Pop","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-022-00467-6","20220613","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32731,""
"Event centrality and post-traumatic stress symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: the roles of attention to negative information, catastrophizing, and rumination","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected college students' mental health and caused post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Event centrality is thought to play a key role in the development of PTSS, but it is not yet clear by what mechanism. Theoretically, event centrality may affect the retrieval of traumatic memories and further prompt post-traumatic cognitions to understand events, and so may in turn be associated with PTSS in college students. However, few empirical studies have examined the mediating role of post-traumatic cognitions in the relationship between event centrality and PTSS, especially among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to examine the mediating roles of post-traumatic cognitive factors (e.g. attention to negative information, catastrophizing, and rumination) in the relationship between event centrality and PTSS among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 1153 college students who completed the pandemic experiences scale, the centrality of event scale, the attention to positive and negative information scale, the cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire, and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. In this sample of college students, event centrality directly predicted PTSS, and PTSS was also indirectly predicted by event centrality through attention to negative information, catastrophizing, and rumination. These findings support the existing literature on the relationship between event centrality, proposed cognitive variables, and PTSS, and shed light on the mechanisms underlying PTSS. Our findings also highlight the importance and applicability of targeted cognitive interventions for PTSS in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused post-traumatic stress symptoms among college students.Event centrality is a risk factor of post-traumatic stress symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.Attention to negative information, catastrophizing and rumination mediate the relationship between event centrality and post-traumatic stress symptoms. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La pandemia de enfermedad coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) ha afectado la salud mental de los estudiantes universitarios y causado sÃƒÂ­ntomas de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (PTSS por sus siglas en ingles). Se cree que la centralidad del evento juega un rol importante en el desarrollo de PTSS, pero aÃƒÂºn no estÃƒÂ¡ claro por quÃƒÂ© mecanismo. TeÃƒÂ³ricamente, la centralidad del evento podrÃƒÂ­a afectar la recuperaciÃƒÂ³n de los recuerdos traumÃƒÂ¡ticos y estimular cogniciones postraumÃƒÂ¡ticas para comprender los eventos y asÃƒÂ­ su vez, podrÃƒÂ­a estar asociada con PTSS en estudiantes universitarios. Sin embargo, pocos estudios empÃƒÂ­ricos han examinado el rol mediador de las cogniciones postraumÃƒÂ¡ticas en la relaciÃƒÂ³n entre centralidad del evento y PTSS, especialmente entre estudiantes universitarios durante la pandemia de COVID-19.<b>Objetivos:</b> El objetivo de este estudio fue examinar los roles mediadores de los factores cognitivos postraumÃƒÂ¡ticos (ej.: atenciÃƒÂ³n a informaciÃƒÂ³n negativa, catastrofizaciÃƒÂ³n y rumiaciÃƒÂ³n) en la relaciÃƒÂ³n entre centralidad del evento y PTSS entre los estudiantes universitarios durante la pandemia de COVID 19<b>.</b> <b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> Reclutamos 1.153 estudiantes universitarios que completaron la escala de experiencias pandÃƒÂ©micas, la escala de centralidad del evento, la escala de atenciÃƒÂ³n a la informaciÃƒÂ³n positiva y negativa, el cuestionario de regulaciÃƒÂ³n cognitiva de las emociones y la lista de chequeo de TEPT para el DSM-5 durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en mayo del 2020.<b>Resultados:</b> En esta muestra de estudiantes universitarios, la centralidad del evento predijo directamente PTSS, y PTSS fueron tambien predichos indirectamente tambien por la centralidad del evento travÃƒÂ©s de la atenciÃƒÂ³n a la informaciÃƒÂ³n negativa, catastrofizaciÃƒÂ³n y rumiaciÃƒÂ³n.<b>Conclusiones:</b> Estos hallazgos apoyan la literatura existente en la relaciÃƒÂ³n entre centralidad del evento, las variables cognitivas propuestas y PTSS y arrojan luz sobre los mecanismos subyacentes a PTSS. Nuestros hallazgos destacan tambien la importancia y aplicabilidad de las intervenciones cognitivas dirigidas a los PTSS en estudiantes universitarios durante la pandemia de COVID-19. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> 2019Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½(COVID-19)Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥Â¼â€¢Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶(PTSS)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Å“Â¨PTSSÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨ÂµÂ·Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã©â€Â®Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã¥Â°Å¡Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¦Â¸â€¦Ã¦Â¥Å¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Ââ€ Ã¨Â®ÂºÃ¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¨Â®Â°Ã¥Â¿â€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â­Â¥Ã¤Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã§Ââ€ Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¦Â­Â¤Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Å¡â€žPTSSÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€žÂ¶Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥Â°â€˜Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¤Â¸Å½PTSSÃ¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Å“Â¨COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥Â½â€œÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã§Â©Â¶COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â (Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¥Â¦â€šÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Â¶Ë†Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§ÂÂ¾Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†Â)Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¥â€™Å’PTSSÃ¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¹Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Å“Â¨2020Ã¥Â¹Â´5Ã¦Å“Ë†COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦â€¹â€ºÃ¥â€¹Å¸Ã¤Âºâ€ 1153Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥Å’â€“Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾Â/Ã¦Â¶Ë†Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¥â€™Å’ DSM-5 PTSDÃ¦Â Â¸Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Âµâ€¹Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¯Â¥Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã§â€ºÂ´Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹PTSSÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¹Å¸Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¦Â¶Ë†Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦Â³Â¨Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§ÂÂ¾Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ë†ÂÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹PTSSÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã¥Å’â€“Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥ÂËœÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¥â€™Å’PTSSÃ¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Å½Â°Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã§Å’Â®Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã©ËœÂÃ¦ËœÅ½Ã¤Âºâ€ PTSSÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â¿ËœÃ¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å“Â¨COVID-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸PTSSÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Å“â€°Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦ÂÃ¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©â‚¬â€šÃ§â€Â¨Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Yang, Xu, Tan, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2022.2078563","20220613","Event centrality; PTSS; attention to negative information; catastrophizing; rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32732,""
"Community mental health interventions for people with major depressive disorder: A scoping review","People with major depressive disorder continue to be marred by chronically pernicious yet preventable outcomes in the biopsychosocial aspects. With the reallocation of healthcare resources towards the fight against the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, much emphasis has been placed on existing community mental health interventions to ameliorate the disruption of mental health services. Moreover, the recent propulsion of community mental health services by the World Health Organization Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 ignited the need to bolster existing community interventions by providing comprehensive, responsive and integrated mental healthcare. The enhanced emphasis on mental healthcare in the community and the heightened demands of people with major depressive disorder underscores the need to explore the current state of community mental health interventions. This scoping review examined 51 primary studies published from year 2010 to 2020 using Arskey &amp; O'Malley's five-stage framework and provided an overview of the impact of existing community mental health interventions for people with major depressive disorder. Findings using thematic analysis have recommended the adoption of person-centred community mental healthcare via the biopsychosocial approach for people with major depressive disorder. Enablers of community mental health interventions were driven by culturally appropriate care and augmented by technology-driven modalities. Challenges and gaps of community mental health interventions include the perpetuation of stigma and misconception, complex demands of persons with major depressive disorder and lack of holistic and long-term outcomes. Given the impact of major depressive disorder on the various biopsychosocial aspects, it is envisioned that our insights into the enablers and barriers of community mental health interventions will guide prospective interdisciplinary and nurse-led interventions in holistically improving the care of persons with major depressive disorder in the community settings.","Tan, Goh","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13029","20220613","community mental health centres; community mental health service; community psychiatry; depressive disorder; depressive disorder, major","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32733,""
"Breastfeeding Practices Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Fortaleza, Northeastern Brazil","Physical distancing associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to suboptimal maternal mental health, social support after birth, and infant feeding practices. To compare breastfeeding prevalence in participants who were pregnant at a time when strict physical distancing measures were imposed in Fortaleza, the capital of CearÃƒÂ¡ state, Brazil, with the pre-pandemic breastfeeding levels, and to assess the association of breastfeeding prevalence with maternal common mental disorders, and sociodemographic and health predictors. A cross-sectional prospective two-group comparison design using two population-based surveys was carried out in Fortaleza before and after the pandemic. Participants (<i>n</i> = 351) who had a live birth in Fortaleza in July or August 2020, and participants (<i>n</i> = 222) who had a child younger than 12 months in 2017 were surveyed. Crude and adjusted multinomial logistic regressions with robust variance were used to estimate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Similar prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding were observed in 2021 (8.1%) and 2017 (8.5%; <i>p =</i> .790). An increase in predominant (2.2% vs. 13.4%; <i>p &lt;</i> .001) and a decrease in complementary breastfeeding (64.0% vs. 48.4%; <i>p =</i> .037) was observed in 2021, compared to 2017. The prevalence of maternal common mental disorders also increased in 2021 (17.6% vs. 32.5%, <i>p &lt;</i> .001). No statistically significant associations were found between breastfeeding patterns, maternal common mental disorders, and other predictors in 2017 or 2021. Participants who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic delayed solid foods introduction and breastfed predominantly longer than participants during the pre-pandemic period. While common mental disorders significantly increased, they were not associated with differences in breastfeeding.","FarÃƒÂ­as-AntÃƒÂºnez, Correia, AraÃƒÂºjo, Penna, de Sousa, Silva, Campos, Rocha, Aquino, Castro, Tavares Machado","https://doi.org/10.1177/08903344221101874","20220613","Brazil; COVID-19 lockdown; COVID-19 pandemic; breastfeeding; breastfeeding practices; cross-sectional studies; maternal and child Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32734,""

"Strategies and Lessons Learned from a Home Delivery Food Prescription Program for Older Adults","Food insecurity (FI) is a growing health problem, worsening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fresh food prescription programs (FFRx) have been shown to increase healthy eating and decrease FI, but few FFRx are community-informed, or theory based. Our FFRx was a delivery program developed to alleviate FI for older adults. It was implemented in an academic medical center and guided by the Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations, and Behaviors and Theoretical Domains Framework.

"CoviXNet: A novel and efficient deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 using chest X-Ray images","The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created havoc on humanity by causing millions of deaths and adverse physical and mental health effects. To prepare humankind for the fast and efficient detection of the virus and its variants shortly, COVID-19 detection using Artificial Intelligence and Computer-Aided Diagnosis has been the subject of several studies. To detect COVID-19, there are numerous publicly accessible datasets of Chest X-rays that the researchers have combined to solve the problem of inadequate data. The cause for concern here is that in combining two or more datasets, some of the images might be duplicates, so a curated dataset has been used in this study, taken from an author's paper. This dataset consists of 1281 COVID-19, 3270 Normal X-rays, and 1656 viral-pneumonia infected Chest X-ray images. Dataset has been pre-processed and divided carefully to ensure that there are no duplicate images. A comparative study on many traditional pre-trained models was performed, analyzing top-performing models. Fine-tuned InceptionV3, Modified EfficientNet B0&amp;B1 produced an accuracy of 99.78% on binary classification, i.e., covid-19 infected and normal Chest X-ray image. ResNetV2 had a classification accuracy of 97.90% for 3-class classification i.e., covid-19 infected, normal, and pneumonia. Furthermore, a trailblazing custom CNN-based model, CoviXNet, has been proposed consisting of 15 layers that take efficiency into account. The proposed model CoviXNet exhibited a 10-fold accuracy of 99.47% on binary classification and 96.61% on 3-class. CoviXNet has shown phenomenal performance with exceptional accuracy and minimum computational cost. We anticipate that this comparative study, along with the proposed model CoviXNet, can assist medical centers with the efficient real-life detection of Coronavirus.","Srivastava, Chauhan, Jangid, Chaurasia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2022.103848","20220613","COVID-19; Chest X-Ray images; Convolutional neural networks; CoviXNet; Deep transfer learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32738,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychiatric Emergencies in Two Different Settings: Emergency Room and Community Mental Health Service","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a public health emergency with profound consequences on physical and mental health of individuals. Emergency Rooms (ER) and Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) played a key role in the management of psychiatric emergencies during the pandemic. The purpose of the study was to evaluate urgent psychiatric consultations (UPCs) in the ERs of the General Hospitals and in the CMHS of a Northern Italian town during the pandemic period. This monocentric observational study collected UPCs carried out in ER from 01/03/2020 to 28/02/2021 (the so called ""COVID-19 period"") and the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who required UPCs in the 12-months period, comparing these data with those collected from 01/03/2019 to 29/02/2020 (the so called ""pre-COVID-19 period""). The same variables were collected for UPCs carried out in CMHS from 01/03/2020 to 31/01/2021 and compared with those collected from 01/03/2019 to 31/01/2020. The data, were statistically analyzed through STATA 12-2011. In ER, we reported a 24% reduction in UPCs during the COVID-19 period (<i>n</i> = 909) in comparison with the pre-COVID-19 period (<i>n</i> = 1,194). Differently, we observed an increase of 4% in UPCs carried out in CMHS during the COVID-19 period (<i>n</i> = 1,214) in comparison with the previous period (<i>n</i> = 1,162). We observed an increase of UPCs in ER required by people who lived in psychiatric facilities or with disability pension whereas more UPCs in CMHS were required by older people or those living in other institutions compared to the previous period. In the COVID-19 period, the most frequent reasons for UPCs in ER were aggressiveness, socio-environmental maladjustment and psychiatric symptoms in organic disorders whereas in CMHS we reported an increase of UPCs for control of psychopharmacology therapy and mixed state/mania. In light of our findings, we conclude that the most vulnerable people required more frequent attention and care in both ER and CMHS during pandemic, which disrupted individuals' ability to adapt and induced many stressful reactive symptoms. In order to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, psychological support interventions for the general population should be implemented, having particular regard for more psychologically fragile people.","Di Lorenzo, Pinelli, Bertani, Cutino, Dragone, Elia, Farina, Fiore, Luisi, Panico, Valeo, Rovesti, Ferri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.894939","20220613","COVID-19 pandemic; Community Mental Health Service; Emergency Room; psychiatric emergencies; vulnerable people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32739,""
"The Feasibility and Effectiveness of a Novel, On-Line Social Skills Intervention for Individuals With Prader-Willi Syndrome","People with neurodevelopmental disabilities, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), are at heightened risk for the negative sequalae of loneliness, including depression and anxiety. While societal factors such as stigma or limited social opportunities contribute to loneliness, so too do deficits in social cognition and social skills. People with PWS have specific difficulties recognizing affect in others, accurately interpreting social interactions, and taking the perspectives of others. These features, combined with hyperphagia, rigidity, and insistence on sameness conspire to impede the abilities of people with PWS to make and sustain friendships and reduce feelings of loneliness. We developed and administered an intervention, Building Our Social Skills (BOSS), that aimed to improve social skill deficits in PWS. The 10-week intervention was administered on-line via Zoom to 51 young people with PWS in the U.S. (M age = 20.8, SD = 6.42). Two clinicians co-led groups of 6-8 participants in 30-min sessions, 3 times per week, and also trained 4 graduate students to co-lead groups with high fidelity. We used a pre-post intervention and 3-month follow-up design, with no control group, and mitigated this design limitation by triangulating across informants and methodologies. Specifically, parents completed the widely used Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and participants were individually interviewed about their friendships and loneliness. Interview responses were reliably coded by independent raters. Repeated measure multivariate analyses, with baseline values entered as covariates, revealed significant pre-to post-test improvements in the SRS's social cognition, motivation and communication subscales (<i>p</i>'s &lt; 0.001), with large effect sizes ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>n</mml:mtext></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mtext>p</mml:mtext></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:msubsup> </mml:math> = 0.920, 0.270, and 0.204, respectively). Participant and parental reports of loneliness were correlated with the CBCL's Internalizing domain, specifically the Anxiety/Depressed subdomain. Over time, parents reported getting along better with peers, increased contact with friends, more friends and less loneliness. Participants also reported significantly less loneliness and more friends. This mixed method, proof-of-concept study demonstrated the feasibility of delivering an on-line social skills intervention to young people with PWS. As no differences were found between clinician vs. graduate student outcomes, the BOSS curriculum holds considerable promise for wider dissemination and implementation in the PWS community.","Dykens, Roof, Hunt-Hawkins, McDonald","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.863999","20220613","COVID-19; building social skills in Prader-Willi syndrome; loneliness; social cognition; social isolation; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32740,""
"COVID-19 Information Overload, Negative Emotions and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Cross-Sectional Study","Under the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large amount of COVID-19-related information can cause an individual's perceived information overload, further halting the individual's psychological health. As a minor psychological discomfort could develop severe mental disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, it is necessary to understand the chain linkage of COVID-19 information overload turn to posttraumatic stress disorder to ensure timely intervention can be offered at each point of mental state transformation. Hence, we examined the negative outcomes of COVID-19 information overload and investigated the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on posttraumatic stress disorder. A convenient sample of Chinese adults (<i>n</i> = 1150) was investigated by an online survey from July 2020 to March 2021. The extent of COVID-19 information overload was measured by the information overload severity scale on the text of the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological distress symptoms were measured using a 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9), and the psychometric properties of the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C). Structural equation modeling and bootstrap methods were utilized to analyze the relationships between variables. COVID-19 information overload is positively related to an individual's anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, COVID-19 information overload can indirectly affect an individual's PTSD symptoms by increasing the feeling of depression. R<sup>2</sup> values of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were 0.471, 0.324, and 0.795, respectively. COVID-19 information overload, anxiety, depression, and PTSD are negative psychological states, and each variable is closely linked with the others, suggesting the need for potential psychological interventions at specific times. Practical public training, such as crisis coping and information filtering, is essential. Regulation of technology companies is also essential.","Wang, Huang, Wang, Wang, Xu, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.894174","20220613","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; information dissemination; mental health; nursing; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32741,""
"Increased Autonomic Reactivity and Mental Health Difficulties in COVID-19 Survivors: Implications for Medical Providers","Because there is a relationship between mental health (MH) and medical adversity and autonomic dysregulation, we hypothesized that individuals infected with COVID-19 would report greater current autonomic reactivity and more MH difficulties (emotional distress, mindfulness difficulties, and posttraumatic stress). We also hypothesized that individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who are experiencing difficulties related to their prior adversity and those providing medical care to COVID-19 patients would be more negatively impacted due to their increased stress and infection rates. US participants (<i>N</i> = 1,638; 61% female; Age <i>M</i> = 46.80) completed online self-report measures of prior adversity, current autonomic reactivity and current MH difficulties, and COVID-19 diagnosis history. Participants diagnosed with COVID-19 (<i>n</i> = 98) were more likely to be younger and providing medical care to COVID-19 patients. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 reported increased current autonomic reactivity, being more negatively impacted by their prior MH/medical adversities, and currently experiencing more MH difficulties with an increased likelihood of clinically-significant PTSD and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01 - <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Current autonomic reactivity mediated 58.9% to 85.2% of the relationship between prior adversity and current MH difficulties; and COVID-19 diagnosis moderated and enhanced the effect of prior adversity on current autonomic reactivity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Being a medical provider was associated with increased current autonomic reactivity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), while moderating and enhancing the relationship between current autonomic reactivity and emotional distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Combining COVID-19 diagnosis with being a medical provider increased likelihood of clinically-significant PTSD and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

"Social distancing and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis and mental health","Many states, local authorities, organizations, and individuals have taken action to reduce the spread of COVID-19, particularly focused on restricting social interactions. Such actions have raised controversy regarding their implications for the spread of COVID-19 versus mental health. We examined correlates of: (1) COVID symptoms and test results (i.e., no symptoms/tested negative, symptoms but not tested, tested positive), and (2) mental health symptoms (depressive/anxiety symptoms, COVID-related stress). Data were drawn from Fall 2020 surveys of young adults (n = 2576; <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 24.67; 55.8% female; 31.0% sexual minority; 5.4% Black; 12.7% Asian; 11.1% Hispanic) in six metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with distinct COVID-related state orders. Correlates of interest included MSA, social distancing behaviors, employment status/nature, household composition, and political orientation. Overall, 3.0% tested positive for COVID-19; 7.0% had symptoms but no test; 29.1% reported at least moderate depressive/anxiety symptoms on the PHQ-4 Questionnaire. Correlates of testing positive (vs. having no symptoms) included residing in Oklahoma City vs. Boston, San Diego, or Seattle and less social distancing adherence; there were few differences between those without symptoms/negative test and those with symptoms but not tested. Correlates of greater depressive/anxiety symptoms included greater social distancing adherence, being unemployed/laid off (vs. working outside of the home), living with others (other than partners/children), and being Democrat but not Republican (vs. no lean); findings related to COVID-specific stress were similar. Despite curbing the pandemic, social distancing and individual (e.g., political) and environmental factors that restrict social interaction have negative implications for mental health.","Dickey-Chasins, Romm, Vyas, McDonnell, Wang, Ma, Berg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-022-01722-2","20220613","COVID-19; Mental health; Restriction adherence; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32743,""
"Gender differences in mental distress and affect balance during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major threat to the health and well-being of people around the world that has impacted freedom of movement, social interaction and the economy. The aim of the present work was twofold: first, to study the presence of mental distress, positive and negative experiences and affect balance in women and men in Spain in two different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial ""first state of alarm"" phase, characterized by maximum restrictions, and in the ""new normal"" phase with minimal restrictions, and second, to study the protective role of age, educational level, self-esteem, marital status and social support against mental distress, and as factors that increase the affect balance of women and men in the above mentioned phases of the first wave of the COVID- 19 pandemic in Spain. The study sample consisted of 652 women and 652 men from the general population, aged between 18 and 88 years, who were evaluated through self-reports. Results show greater mental distress in women than men but, strikingly, the magnitude of such differences were greater in the ""new normal"" phase than in the maximum restriction phase. In addition, in this last phase, women also experienced more negative feelings and less affect balance than men. High self-esteem and social support were also found to be protective factors for mental health, both in women and men, during the two phases of the pandemic studied.

"Pregnant Women's Anxiety and Depression Symptoms and Influence Factors in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Changzhou, China","With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pregnant women's psychological conditions have become a global challenge. The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and analyze their influence factors among pregnant women in Changzhou, China during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide them with appropriate healthcare strategies. Participants were 681 pregnant women who visited various obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Changzhou, China between 25 February 2020 and 7 March 2020. They were asked to complete an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. The chi-squared test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were carried out to examine the associated factors in these groups. Overall, the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among pregnant women were 31.72 and 36.12%, respectively, but most of them were mild. Having an irregular diet with poor subjective sleep quality, perceiving little family support, spending too much time on news related to the coronavirus, and having severe subjective life impact by the coronavirus were related to anxiety and depression symptoms. In addition, lack of physical exercise and exposure to electronic screens over 5 h per day were associated with depression symptoms. Pregnant women with an irregular diet, poor sleep quality, little family support, excessive attention to COVID-19 news, and lives impacted by the coronavirus severely are at high risk for anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicates that targeted measures to address mental health in pregnant women during the pandemic period are needed.","Wang, Yang, Zhou, Mao, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.855545","20220613","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; influence factor; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32746,""
"Mental Health and Social Connectedness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of Sports and E-Sports Players","Recently, the pandemic context in which the world finds itself has inspired studies that sought to evaluate to mental health and the way people are relating to the purpose of understanding and promoting improvements psychological health. The epidemiological and public health literature shows that social connection protects and promotes mental health, being an important clinical tool for reducing anxiety, depression, and stress. Thinking in the broad sense of connection, that is, feeling and perceiving oneself connected with the environment, applied to the context of sport, it is suggested that social connection could be related to the interactions in the practice of sport. Although playing sports can promote mental health, there are few findings on the topic in the context of a pandemic and with physical sports and electronic sports (e-sports) players. In this sense, the present study aims to assess the extent to which social connection and mental health indicators are correlated in a sample of sports and e-sports players. The participants were 401 Brazilian physical sports (<i>N</i> = 199, 49.6%) and e-sports players (<i>N</i> = 202, 50.4%), mostly male (53.1%) and single (59.9%), who filled in the Social Connectedness Scale (SCS), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), and demographic questions. The results indicated that social connection was negatively correlated and also predict the anxiety (<i>r</i> = -0.37), depression (<i>r</i> = -0.54), and stress (<i>r</i> = -0.39). When comparing sports and e-sports players, a statistically significant difference was identified in the levels of social connection [<i>t</i>(398) = -3.41; sports<sub>mean</sub> (SD) = 4.53 (1.14); e-sports<sub>mean</sub> (SD) = 4.14 (1.15)] and depression [<i>t</i>(396) = 2.90; sports<sub>mean</sub> (SD) = 1.10 (0.89); e-sports<sub>mean</sub> (SD) = 0.85 (0.81)]. These findings can serve as a theoretical basis for the development of intervention programs (e.g., to guide managers regarding the social distancing rules that enable them to keep holding sports practices and events) and promoting discussions that focus on the analysis of aspects promoting psychological health in sports context (physical and e-sports).","Soares, Goedert, Vargas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.802653","20220613","e-sport; mental health; social connectivity; sports; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32747,""
"Climate change and allergies","The climate crisis poses aÃ‚Â major challenge to human health as well as the healthcare system and threatens to jeopardize the medical progress made in recent decades. However, addressing climate change may also be the greatest opportunity for global health in the 21st century. The climate crisis and its consequences, such as rising temperatures, forest fires, floods, droughts, and changes in the quality and quantity of food and water, directly and indirectly affect human physical and mental health. More intense and frequent heat waves and declining air quality have been shown to increase all-cause mortality, especially among the most vulnerable. Climate warming alters existing ecosystems and favors biological invasions by species that better tolerate heat and drought. Pathogen profiles are changing, and the transmission and spread of vector-borne diseases are increasing. The spread of neophytes in Europe, such as ragweed, is creating new pollen sources that increase allergen exposure for allergy sufferers. In addition, the overall milder weather, especially in combination with air pollution and increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels, is changing the production and allergenicity of pollen. The phenomenon of thunderstorm asthma is also occurring more frequently. In view of the increasing prevalence of allergic diseases due to climate change, early causal immunomodulatory therapy is therefore all the more important. During aÃ‚Â climate consultation, patients can receive individual advice on climate adaptation and resilience and the benefits of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction-for their own and the planet's health. Almost 5% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from the healthcare sector. It thus has aÃ‚Â central responsibility for aÃ‚Â climate-neutral and sustainable transformation.","Luschkova, Traidl-Hoffmann, Ludwig","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40629-022-00212-x","20220613","Air pollution; COVID-19; Heat wave; Pollen allergenicity; Ragweed; Thunderstorm asthma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32748,""
"Global trends of suicidal thought, suicidal ideation, and self-harm during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. The current systematic review is done to know the trend of suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation, and self-harm during COVID-19 pandemic. The search was done by using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases. With the help of Mendeley portal, articles were retrieved on the basis of inclusion criteria like to know the risk factors, vulnerable group, complete article PDFs, prevention strategies, aims, results, and limitations. The shortlisted data from search was tabulated, and the PRISMA chart was framed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixteen studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria were organized and selected. The variables and global scenario were considered in databases. It has been noticed that trends of suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation, and self-harm remains the same in some countries like Japan, whereas in some countries like Bangladesh and France, trends of suicides had increased during the pandemic period. The probable cause could be lockdown, social isolation, and stoppage of recreational activities. The trends of suicidal ideation, suicidal thoughts, and self-harm are more in vulnerable categories like health care professionals, university students, elderly individuals, and psychiatrically ill patients. In health care professional, it is due to the increased risk of contagion and watching deaths closely. In university students, it is due to the lack of recreational activities and social isolation. Among elderly, it is due to thinking themselves as overburden. The increase in suicidality in psychiatric ill patient admitted during COVID-19 pandemic is due to unknown cause.","Shobhana, Raviraj","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41935-022-00286-2","20220613","COVID-19 pandemic; Global scenario; Self-harm; Suicidal ideation; Suicidal thoughts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32749,""

"Effect of Bhramari Pranayama intervention on stress, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among COVID 19 patients in home isolation","COVID-19 outbreak is considered to be a major public health concern as it has a negative impact on the patient's psychological health. In addition, patients under home isolation might be more panic and in stress. In this study, we examined the effect of Bhramari Pranayama (Bhr.P) intervention on patients' psychological distress during home isolation. Ninety-two asymptomatic COVID-19 patients were recruited from the host hospital and willing patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria (n= 42) were selected for the study. The patients were given Bhr.P intervention (20 min) through online for 15 days. Participants were assessed with Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21(DASS-21), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) at baseline and post-intervention. Bhr.P practice has shown a significant (P&lt;0.05) reduction in DASS-21 score of depression, anxiety and stress. In addition, the patients stated significant improvement in quality of sleep (PSQI; p&lt;0.05) and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF; p&lt;0.05) after the intervention. Our findings indicate that Bhr.P intervention had a positive impact on psychological health as well as quality of sleep among the COVID-19 patients during home isolation.

We compare strategies from recent, past and ongoing outbreak measures used to protect HCWs, including those facing additional challenges such as racial disparities, violence and stigmatization. Outbreaks and pandemics superimposed on countries with preexisting crises have also affected emergency response to these viral outbreaks. Strategies to protect HCWs include adherence to recommended infection prevention and control measures; new technology such as rapid point-of-care tests and remote monitoring; adopting national public health preparedness plans to ensure the supply and allocation of PPE, staff, and testing supplies; occupational health and mental health support services.

"Impact of COVID-19 severity on health-related quality of life among Saudi adult patients","COVID-19 patients may experience varying degrees of symptom severity, significantly impacting the health-related quality of life. As a result, the current study examines the impact of symptom severity on health-related quality of life among Saudi adult COVID- 19 patients. In this cross-sectional study 310 adult COVID-19 patients were recruited through a snowball technique in Saudi Arabia. We used a questionnaire (SF-12 RAND tool questionnaire) that included three parts: sociodemographic factors, perception of degree severity of COVID-19 symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Out of 310 COVID-19 adult patients, 200 (64.5%) were female, 110 (35.5%) were between 30-49 years old. The mean scores of the HRQoL, physical components summary (PCS), and mental components summary (MCS) were 58.11Ã‚Â±17.02, 71.32Ã‚Â±23.72, and 44.91Ã‚Â±17.94, respectively.

"Adaptive governance of urban green spaces across Latin America ---Insights amid COVID-19","Urban green spaces' well documented role as a hub for physical and mental health was enhanced by restrictions to mobility issued worldwide as a response to COVID-19. In this context, managers of urban green spaces (UGS) were prompted to provide controlled access under <i>impromptu</i> safety protocols. This unprecedented challenge required planning and operational strengths reflecting flexibility, innovation and learning. These management features are essential for an adaptive governance -an underdeveloped research topic within the study of UGS. Using eighteen semi-structured interviews from six countries, we analyze adaptive governance as reflected by UGS managers' responses across Latin America -a region where access to UGS is a matter of public health and of environmental justice. We document responses that can be categorized based on the governance arrangement in place. On one hand, both polycentric and dedicated-management governances have been able to learn through piloting ideas, adapting personnel roles and the function of UGS infrastructure, and adjusting their decision-making process. On the other hand, managers within municipal public services areas -the most prevalent governance arrangement across Latin America- report difficulty to adapt -likely due to their dependence on political will, lack of continuity due limited autonomy, insufficient budgets, absence of formal paths to self-funding, shortage of technical know-how, and insufficient citizens' involvement. We discuss implications of UGS adaptive governance in terms of capacity to deal with future public health, climate-related or other types of shocks.","Sainz-Santamaria, Martinez-Cruz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127629","20220613","Adaptive governance; COVID-19; Latin America; Urban green spaces","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32756,""
"Anxiety and Coping Stress Strategies in Researchers During COVID-19 Pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world, leading to changes in one's personal and working life.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown ""Home Quarantine"" on the Physical Activity and Lifestyle of Children in Qatar","Several studies have investigated how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted children's lifestyle. To our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses the impact of quarantine on physical activity, screen time, sleep, and diet in children aged 5 to 12 in Qatar. Cross-sectional data from an online survey distributed in Qatar was analyzed. The survey measured the parents' or caregivers' assessment on the change in the child's physical activity, sleep, screen time, and diet between the two periods (before quarantine and during quarantine). The data was analyzed using frequency distributions, paired t-test and McNemar's test. Data from 144 respondents were analyzed. Due to the quarantine, the total weekly average hours of physical activity significantly decreased with a greatest reduction for the school and after school durations. Only 4.5% of the children were engaging in at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day (in contrast to 25.6% prior to quarantine). The reported barriers for physical activity were screen time for school (52.8%) and leisure (51.4%). There was a significant increase in the total number of main meals per day, with a higher consumption of unhealthy food. The majority of the children had their bedtime and waketime shifted to later because of the quarantine.

"Psychological Outcomes of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People with Type 1 Diabetes Globally: A Scoping Review","People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) face heightened risks for morbidity and mortality from the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19). They also have elevated risks for disparate psychological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, given their predisposition to mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, and skyrocketing rates of these conditions among the general population. To investigate the psychological ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with T1D globally, we conducted a scoping review of recent literature across eight online databases. Articles were screened via a rigorous process, and data pertaining to psychological outcomes were coded into thematic areas for analysis. Forty articles presenting data from 27 countries and 14 categories of psychological outcomes affecting people with T1D were included in this review. Psychological outcomes, in order of most to least frequently identified, included: stress, anxiety, social factors, worry, distress, fear, sleep habits, quality of life, depression, attitudes regarding COVID-19, other psychological issues, mental health services utilization, burnout, and temperament. Recurring findings demonstrated significant increases in the prevalence of mental health conditions, changes in sleeping habits, reductions of social support, and extensive psychosocial concerns among people with T1D. Associations between patients' psychological issues and demographic characteristics, diabetes self-management behaviors, glycemic control, and overall wellbeing were evident. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people with T1D have experienced pervasive psychological burdens. This review calls for further research examining the long-term impacts of the pandemic and strengthens awareness of the need for interventions to offset psychological challenges affecting people with T1D.","Maizel, Dixon, Walker","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573399818666220609154132","20220613","COVID-19; coronavirus; diabetes; mental health; psychology; type 1 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32761,""
"Problem drinkers and high risk-taking behaviors under the stay-at-home policy of the COVID-19 emergency declaration","To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether problem drinkers have had high risk-taking behaviors during the stay-at-home policy (e.g., dining out at a bar) under the COVID-19 emergency declaration. We investigated data from Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey(JACSIS)study-a web-based nationwide survey, conducted from August to September 2020. From a total of 12,076 current drinkers, problem drinkers were detected by Cut, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener (CAGE) questions. A CAGE score of 4 showed potential alcohol use disorder and scores of 2 to3 showed potential alcohol abuse; individuals with these scores were regarded as problem drinkers compared to light-or-no-risk drinkers, with a CAGE score of 0 to 1. The outcome assessed the presence of 18 behaviors against the stay-at-home policy, such as dining out at a bar, meeting people, or going to crowded places. All these behaviors were limited in Japan during the first declaration of emergency between April and May 2020. Based on the multivariable logistic regression, the participants with potential alcohol use disorder demonstrated 16 out of the 18 risk-taking behaviors, such as dining out at a bar (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-2.79), dining out at a restaurant (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI:1.37-2.35), visiting friends (aOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.34-2.44), going to karaoke (1.97; 95% CI: 1.26-3.10), and riding on a crowded train (aOR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.07-1.99), compared to light-or-no risk drinkers with a CAGE score of 0 to 1. Additionally, participants with potential alcohol abuse (CAGE score of 2 to 3) had 10 out of 18 behaviors against the stay-at-home policy: the corresponding aORs for the aforementioned behaviors were 1.45 (95% CI: 1.25-1.67), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12-1.44), 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01-1.36), 1.49 (95% CI: 1.17-1.90), and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.03-1.38), respectively. Problem drinkers had a significant association with being men, a higher income and job position, smoking, sleep deprivation, depression, and other mental diseases.

Data of 5945 respondents age 18-years-old and above from 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa collected through an online survey conducted between June and December 2020, were extracted. The dependent variable was COVID-19 status (testing positive for COVID-19 and having symptoms of COVID-19 but not getting tested). The independent variables were non-communicable disease status (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, heart conditions, respiratory conditions, depression), HIV positive status, COVID-19 status (knowing a close friend who tested positive for COVID-19 and someone who died from COVID-19) and co-habiting (yes/no). Two binary logistic regression models developed to determine associations between the dependent and independent variables were adjusted for age, sex, employment, sub region and educational status. Having a close friend who tested positive for COVID-19 (AOR:6.747), knowing someone who died from COVID-19 infection (AOR:1.732), and living with other people (AOR:1.512) were significantly associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 infection, while living with HIV was associated with significantly lower odds of testing positive for COVID-19 infection (AOR:0.284). Also, respondents with respiratory conditions (AOR:2.487), self-reported depression (AOR:1.901), those who had a close friend who tested positive for COVID-19 infection (AOR:2.562) and who knew someone who died from COVID-19 infection (AOR:1.811) had significantly higher odds of having symptoms of COVID-19 infection but not getting tested. Non-communicable diseases seem not to increase the risk for COVID-19 positive test while cohabiting seems to reduce this risk. The likelihood that those who know someone who tested positive to or who died from COVID-19 not getting tested when symptomatic suggests there is poor contact tracing in the region. People with respiratory conditions and depression need support to get tested for COVID-19.","Folayan, AbeldaÃƒÂ±o ZuÃƒÂ±iga, Virtanen, El Tantawi, AbeldaÃƒÂ±o, Ishabiyi, Jafer, Al-Khanati, Quadri, Yousaf, Ellakany, Nzimande, Ara, Khalid, Lawal, Lusher, Popoola, Idigbe, Khan, Ayanore, Gaffar, Osamika, Aly, Ndembi, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07498-w","20220612","COVID-19; COVID-19 testing; Depression; HIV; Respiration disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32763,""
"The effects of compulsory isolation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic: The example of prison workers","The aim of this research was to identify depression, anxiety, and perceived social support levels among prison workers and to determine the relationship between anxiety and depression and perceived social support. The descriptive, cross-sectional research was conducted between 15 November 2020, and 10 February 2021. The study sample consisted of 603 prison workers contacted using the convenience sampling method, consenting to take part in the research, and working under compulsory Covid-19 isolation measures. A questionnaire produced in an electronic environment consisting of a personal information form, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) questions was employed. The mean GAD, PHQ and MSPSS scores of the prison workers working under compulsory isolation conditions were 18.38Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 5.78, 14.30Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.99, and 42.76Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 20.27, respectively. Of the prison workers in this study, 71.5% exhibited severe depression symptoms and 21.4% moderate depression, while 25.5% exhibited severe anxiety symptoms and 23.4% moderate anxiety symptoms. MSPSS and its subdomains exhibited negative correlation with depression, and the MSPSS friends subdomain was negatively correlated with anxiety. Anxiety and depression scores were at high levels in prison workers exposed to compulsory isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Ayhan, Balsak, Ayhan","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3528","20220612","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; prison workers; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32764,""
"Eotaxin-1 (CCL11) in neuroinflammatory disorders and possible role in COVID-19 neurologic complications","The related neurologic complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients and survivors comprise symptoms including depression, anxiety, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, fatigue, and anosmia/hyposmia that may continue for months. Recent studies have been demonstrated that chemokines have brain-specific attraction and effects such as chemotaxis, cell adhesion, modulation of neuroendocrine functions, and neuroinflammation. CCL11 is a member of the eotaxin family that is chemotactic agents for eosinophils and participate in innate immunity. Eotaxins may exert physiological and pathological functions in the central nerve system, and CCL11 may induce neuronal cytotoxicity effects by inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in microglia cells. Plasma levels of CCL11 elevated in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. COVID-19 patients display elevations in CCL11 levels. As CCL11 plays roles in physiosomatic and neuroinflammation, analyzing the level of this chemokine in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization and to predicting post-COVID-19-related neurologic complications may be worthwhile. Moreover, using chemokine modulators may be helpful in lessening the neurologic complications in such patients.","Nazarinia, Behzadifard, Gholampour, Karimi, Gholampour","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13760-022-01984-3","20220612","CCL11; COVID-19; Eotaxin-1; Neuroinflammation; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32765,""
"Mindfulness: Implications for Research Methods","Mindfulness, defined as focusing on the present moment without judgment, has shown clinical efficacy in pediatric research. Mindfulness-based interventions reduce anxiety, depression, and burnout in pediatric nurses and health care providers, and improve asthmatic symptoms, eating disorders, and stress in pediatric patients. We provide an overview of mindfulness-based interventions in pediatric research, a summary of the techniques and exercises that comprise mindfulness, and a list of mindfulness measures that can be used for evaluating mindful practices in research. We aimed to provide an educational overview of how mindfulness can be incorporated into research methods, including interventions in pediatric health care.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2022.01.004","20220501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32766,""

"Quaranteens: Pre-pandemic relationship quality and changes in adolescent internalizing problems during the COVID-19 pandemic","This preregistered longitudinal study examined changes in adolescents' depressive and anxiety symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using latent piece-wise growth models. It also assessed whether perceived support from and conflict with mothers, fathers, siblings, and best friends could explain heterogeneity in these change patterns. 192 Dutch ethnic majority adolescents (Mean age 14.3 years; 68.8% female) completed online questionnaires every two weeks for a year (November 2019 to October 2020), which included a pre-pandemic, a lockdown, and a re-opening phase. During lockdown, depressive symptoms but not anxiety symptoms increased, and during re-opening, depressive and anxiety symptoms decreased. Heterogeneity in depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was not explained by pre-pandemic family and friend support and conflict.","Kirsten Buist et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0134-A71-776","20220614","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; adolescents; internalizing problems; relationship quality; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-14","",32768,""
