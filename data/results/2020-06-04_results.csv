"Impact of psychological health on dry eye and management during the coronavirus disease-19 epidemic","At the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan and has spread throughout the world, bringing great challengees to the public health, prevention, and control work in our country and globally  Although the national medical staff and Public Health Epidemic Prevention personnel are fighting the epidemic, the large numbers of patients and the long-term isolation measures greatly impacted people&#039;s lifestyles  The epidemic&#039;s development has currently been eased, but the blockades and quarantines in many cities have not been completely lifted  While controlling the coronavirus, lifestyle changes caused by long-term isolation, as well as fear of the disease and economic recession have brought people various negative emotions  These mental health issues may cause or aggravate the occurrence and development of dry eye  Therefore, the authors explore the impact of mental health on dry eye during the COVID-19 epidemic, alongside possible mechanisms, and put forward relevant suggestions for managing eye-related diseases during and after the epidemic","Yu, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Wan, S.; Huang, Y.; Wang, H.; Yang, Y.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+psychological+health+on+dry+eye+and+management+during+the+coronavirus+disease-19+epidemic","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1546,""
"Online Mental Health Survey in a Medical College in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei province, has led to the quarantine of many residents in their homes, in order to mitigate its spread  Some of these people developed mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease  However, not much attention has been given to students, particularly those from medical school  The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of students from a medical college in Hubei province  Materials and Methods: The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star, which contained questions from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), was utilized for the present study  Results: A total of 217 students participated in the survey  Among these students, 127 were female and 90 were male  Furthermore, 77 students (35 5%) who participated in the survey were in a state of depression, and 48 (22 1%) were in a state of anxiety  The majority of students who were in depressed (n=75) or anxiety (n=46) states had mild or moderate states  There were no significant differences in students in terms of gender, geographical location, and grade, for the prevalence of depression and anxiety  Conclusion: The present study implies that universities need to take measures to prevent, identify, and deal with mental health problems among students during large-scale stressors","Liu, J.; Zhu, Q.; Fan, W.; Makamure, J.; Zheng, C.; Wang, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Online+Mental+Health+Survey+in+a+Medical+College+in+China+During+the+COVID-19+Outbreak","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1547,""
"The role of ecosystems in mitigation and management of Covid-19 and other zoonoses","There is rising international concern about the zoonotic origins of many global pandemics  Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health  Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems  This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans  It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission  Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem services into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases  Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity  We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases;and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer;and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks  From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management  Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity  The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future  Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the â€˜biodiversity crisisâ€™  This also highlights the need for concerted global action, and is also consistent with the duties, and ultimately the self-interests, of developed, donor nations","Everard, M.; Johnston, P.; Santillo, D.; Staddon, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+role+of+ecosystems+in+mitigation+and+management+of+Covid-19+and+other+zoonoses","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1548,""

"How mental health services are adapting to provide care in the pandemic","Emma Wilkinson talks to healthcare workers who are trying to ensure that vulnerable psychiatric patients do not get sidelined by covid-19â€”and finds that some changes may become permanent As the NHS rapidly ramped up critical care capacity to deal with the surge of severely ill covid-19 patients, other specialties quickly had to rethink how to manage routine care while avoiding face-to-face contact with patients when possible  For mental health services this has meant a host of changes, the biggest being the rapid adoption of video and phone consultationsâ€” an approach that had rarely been used in a field where relationships and trust between clinicians and patients are vital, and where body language and eye contact are a key part of assessment  Billy Boland, consultant psychiatrist and deputy medical director at Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, says that some therapy is also being done online, and community crisis teams that have always worked to keep people out of hospital are making greater use of technology  He explains, â€œMost services have not stopped seeing people face to face completely, but they have definitely tried to adjust  It is more widespread than it has ever been â€ Communicating with a patient who is not in the room can be hard, he says  â€œWhen examining a patient you are trying to get a feel for their mental health symptoms, and that assessment includes how they look, how they behave, [and] how they respond to your questions,â€ says Boland  â€œIt doesnâ€™t mean it canâ€™t be done, but you have to consider the differences â€ Alka Ahuja, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and visiting professor at the University of South Wales, believes that â€œmental health is something that aligns itself very well with telehealthâ€ but that it is a cultural shift for clinicians to use it  She â€¦","Wilkinson, Emma","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+mental+health+services+are+adapting+to+provide+care+in+the+pandemic","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1558,""

METHODS: In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS: Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0%; p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition. They could show atypical symptoms without fever or cough and multiple organ dysfunction. Old-old patients tend to have more complications than young-old patients during hospitalization. Careful nursing, observation, and systemic treatment are very important in elderly patients.","Guo, Ting; Shen, Qinxue; Guo, Wei; He, Wenlong; Li, Jinhua; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Yunnian; Zhou, Zhiguo; Deng, Dingding; Ouyang, Xiaoli; Xiang, Zhi; Jiang, Minyan; Liang, Minyong; Huang, Peng; Peng, Zaimei; Xiang, Xudong; Liu, Wenlong; Luo, Hong; Chen, Ping; Peng, Hong","CH","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1562,""

"Compliance and Psychological Impact of Quarantine in Children and Adolescents due to Covid-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVES: To examine a cohort of children and adolescents quarantined during Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in India and to describe their understanding of, compliance with and the psychological impact of quarantine experience. METHODS: One hundred twenty one children and adolescents along with their parents were interviewed regarding their compliance and psychological distress during the quarantine period. A comparable data was also obtained from 131 children and adolescents who were not quarantined. RESULTS: Most of the children and adolescents were non-compliant as compliance with all requirements was low (7.43%), though compliance with community protective measures (17.35%) was better than compliance with household protective measures (10.71%). Quarantined children and adolescents experienced greater psychological distress than non-quarantined children and adolescents (p Ã‹<U+0082>0.001). Worry (68.59%), helplessness (66.11%) and fear (61.98%) were the most common feelings experienced under quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: The low compliance with quarantine requirements as seen in this study raises a serious concern about the effectiveness of quarantine as a preventive measure of disease transmission. Compliance and mental health problems can be improved by providing adequate financial support and enhanced knowledge about pandemic planning.","Saurabh, Kumar; Ranjan, Shilpi","IN","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1574,""

"[THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH - LITERATURE REVIEW]","INTRODUCTION: The spread of epidemics resulting in many deaths has been known since the dawn of civilization, for example, the typhus and smallpox epidemics and the plague. Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60&#039;s, the AIDS epidemic (HIV). Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza. In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more. Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life. Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives. It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people. The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world. The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths. Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority. However, coping with the implications to people&#039;s mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.","Shelef, Leah; Zalsman, Gil","IL","","159","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1598,""

"One Health Aotearoa: a transdisciplinary initiative to improve human, animal and environmental health in New Zealand","There is increased recognition that complex health challenges at the human-animal-environmental interface require a transdisciplinary, â€œwhole-of-societyâ€ approach. This philosophy is particularly pertinent in Aotearoa-New Zealand because of the countryâ€™s relatively isolated island ecosystem, economic reliance on agriculture and its intensification, and existing indigenous worldview that emphasises holism and interconnectivity between humans, animals and the environment. In New Zealand, the One Health Aotearoa (OHA) alliance was established in order to better connect researchers and to address a growing number of infectious diseases challenges. The emphasis of OHA is to bring together and facilitate interactions between people from diverse disciplines, link to stakeholders and communities, and engage with policy-makers, government operational agencies, and funders, thus providing a holistic and integrative systems-thinking approach to address priority questions and achieve desired outcomes in One Health. The initial focus of OHA has been on infectious diseases, but there is increasing recognition of the potential benefits of the alliance to address broader complex issues. Greater involvement and overlap of the environmental sciences, human and animal health sciences, social science, and indigenous kaupapa Maori research is particularly critical for ensuring its success within the New Zealand context. Given the economic and cultural importance of New Zealandâ€™s â€œclean, greenâ€ image, a One Health approach that draws strongly on the environmental sciences makes particular sense. Furthermore, as the global environment becomes increasingly stressed by anthropogenic pressures our research may hold potential solutions for similar challenges elsewhere.","Harrison, Sarah; Baker, Michael G.; Benschop, Jackie; Death, Russell G.; French, Nigel P.; Harmsworth, Garth; Lake, Robin J.; Lamont, Iain L.; Priest, Patricia C.; Ussher, James E.; Murdoch, David R.","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s42522-020-0011-0","20200131","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1614,""
"Quality Improvement Innovation in a Maternal and Child Health Network: Negotiating Course Corrections in Mid-Implementation","This article analyzes mid-implementation course corrections in a quality improvement innovation for a maternal and child health network working in a large Midwestern metropolitan area. Participating organizations received restrictive funding from this network to screen pregnant women and new mothers for depression, make appropriate referrals, and log screening and referral data into a project-wide data system over a one-year pilot program. This paper asked three research questions: (1) What problems emerged by mid-implementation of this program that required course correction? (2) How were advocacy targets developed to influence network and agency responses to these mid-course problems? (3) What specific course corrections were identified and implemented to get implementation back on track? This ethnographic case study employs qualitative methods including participant observation and interviews. Data were analyzed using the analytic method of qualitative description, in which the goal of data analysis is to summarize and report an event using the ordinary, everyday terms for that event and the unique descriptions of those present. Three key findings are noted. First, network participants quickly responded to the emerged problem of under-performing screening and referral completion statistics. Second, they shifted advocacy targets away from executive appeals and toward the line staff actually providing screening. Third, participants endorsed two specific course corrections, using â€œopt out, not opt inâ€ choice architecture at intake and implementing visual incentives for workers to track progress. Opt-out choice architecture and visual incentives served as useful means of focusing organizational collaboration and correcting mid-implementation problems.","McMillin, Stephen Edward","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42972-020-00004-z","20200508","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1615,""

"Engaging in Late-Life Mental Health Research: a Narrative Review of Challenges to Participation","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This narrative review seeks to ascertain the challenges older patients face with participation in mental health clinical research studies and suggests creative strategies to minimize these obstacles. RECENT FINDINGS: Challenges to older adultsâ€™ engagement in mental health research include practical, institutional, and collaboration-related barriers applicable to all clinical trials as well as more personal, cultural, and age-related patient barriers specific to geriatric mental health research. Universal research challenges include (1) institutional barriers of lack of funding and researchers, inter-researcher conflict, and sampling bias; (2) collaboration-related barriers involving miscommunication and clinician concerns; and (3) practical patient barriers such as scheduling issues, financial constraints, and transportation difficulties. Challenges unique to geriatric mental health research include (1) personal barriers such as no perceived need for treatment, prior negative experience, and mistrust of mental health research; (2) cultural barriers involving stigma and lack of bilingual or culturally matched staff; and (3) chronic medical issues and concerns about capacity. SUMMARY: Proposed solutions to these barriers include increased programmatic focus on and funding of geriatric psychiatry research grants, meeting with clinical staff to clarify study protocols and eligibility criteria, and offering transportation for participants. To minimize stigma and mistrust of psychiatric research, studies should devise community outreach efforts, employ culturally competent bilingual staff, and provide patient and family education about the study and general information about promoting mental health.","Newmark, Jordyn; Gebara, Marie Anne; Aizenstein, Howard; Karp, Jordan F.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s40501-020-00217-9","20200522","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1617,""

"Intimate Partner Violence Prevention and Intervention Group-Format Programs for Immigrant Latinas: a Systematic Review","Immigrant Latinas (IL) experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) often experience barriers to accessing formal support systems due to immigration-related issues (e.g., fear of deportation, language proficiency, lack of family support in the U.S.). This paper contains a systematic review of peer-reviewed published articles within the past 25 years addressing IPV prevention and intervention programming designed for this vulnerable population. We examined specific group-format programs and curricula conducted at community-based agencies with social services across the country. Qualitative analysis of the 10 articles that met search criteria (i.e., programs must be culturally specific, designed to serve IL, conducted in group-format, focused on IPV intervention or prevention) generated information regarding the nature of group interventions addressing this issue and population. Several themes emerged upon completion of the qualitative review describing key characteristics of each intervention. All reviewed articles reported generally positive outcomes using a variety of methods. Studies using quantitative methods found statistically significant outcomes for constructs including depression, self-esteem, and knowledge of wellness. Professionals from diverse practice settings working with IL would likely benefit by developing intervention and prevention group-format programming to address this problem.","Marrs Fuchsel, Catherine L.; Brummett, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10896-020-00160-6","20200523","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1619,""
"Trust in and Ethical Design of Carebots: The Case for Ethics of Care","The paper has two main objectives: to examine the challenges arising from the use of carebots as well as to discuss how the design of carebots can deal with these challenges. First, it notes that the use of carebots to take care of the physical and mental health of the elderly, children and the disabled as well as to serve as assistive tools and social companions encounter a few main challenges. They relate to the extent of the care robotsâ€™ ability to care for humans, potential deception by robot morphology and communications, (over)reliance on or attachment to robots, and the risks of carebot use without informed consent and potential infringements of privacy. Secondly, these challenges impinge upon issues of ethics and trust which are somewhat overlapping in terms of concept and practice. The existing ethical guidelines, standards and regulations are general in nature and lack a central ethical framework and concrete principles applicable to the care contexts. Hence, to deal with these important challenges, it is proposed in the third part of the paper that carebots be designed by taking account of Ethics of Care as the central ethical framework. It argues that the Ethics of Care offer the following advantages: (a) it provides sufficiently concrete principles and embodies values that are sensitive and applicable to the design of carebots and the contexts of caring practices; (b) it coheres with the tenets of Principlism and select ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics); and (c) it is closely associated with the preservation and maintenance of trust.","Yew, Gary Chan Kok","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12369-020-00653-w","20200523","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1620,""
"Suicidal ideation, psychopathology and associated factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia","BACKGROUND: Suicidal behavior is a prevalent psychiatric emergency in HIV-infected adults. Detection of suicidal ideation is important in planning early psychiatric intervention and optimizing HIV/AIDS management. Characterization of suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults is crucial; however, practically there is no data in Indonesia, the country with the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. This study aims to identify suicidal ideation and analyze the associated psychopathology and determining factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults aged 18â€“65 years old receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Measurement using Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was performed to assess the existing psychopathology. Firthâ€™s penalized logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. RESULTS: A total of 86 subjects were recruited. Most subjects were male (65.1%), median age was 35 years, and median latest CD4 count was 463 cells/Âµl. Lifetime suicidal ideation was identified in 20 subjects (23.3%). Mean SCL-90 T-score for depressive and anxiety symptoms were both significantly higher among subjects with suicidal ideation (M = 60.75, SD = 12.0, p = 0.000 and M = 57.9, SD = 2.8, p = 0.001, respectively) compared to those without. Bivariate analyses showed that lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, non-marital status, CD4 count < 500 cells/Âµl, and efavirenz use. Multivariate analysis identified that a single-point increase in SCL-90 depression symptoms score (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 4.5â€“123.6, p = 0.000) and efavirenz use (AOR 5.00, 95% CI 1.02â€“24.6, p = 0.048) were significant independent factors related to suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: Suicidal ideation is commonly found among Indonesian HIV-infected adults on ART. Depressive symptoms and efavirenz use are independent factors related to the presence of suicidal ideation. Thus, early screening of psychopathology as well as substitution of efavirenz with other ART regiment are recommended to prevent suicide and improve HIV/AIDS management outcome.","Ophinni, Youdiil; Adrian; Siste, Kristiana; Wiwie, Martina; Anindyajati, Gina; Hanafi, Enjeline; Damayanti, Reza; Hayashi, Yoshitake","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02666-1","20200524","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1621,""
"Basic Income Advocacy in Canada: Multiple Streams, Experiments and the Road Ahead","Basic income has a long history in Canada, going back to the Great Depression. Its recognition has risen and fallen cyclically, several experiments have been mounted, and some programs, such as the Canada Child Benefit and the Old Age Security demogrant, have been identified as partial basic income schemes. However, a universal basic income for all members of the Canadian political community has never been visibly close to implementation. Against this background, this chapter examines basic income political advocacy from three vantage points. First, the multiple streams framework is used to assess linkages of basic income in the problem stream, its position in the policy stream and forces at play in the political stream. Next, the fate of experiments is described, along with approaches for increasing the likelihood that experiments will result in full-scale policy implementation if outcomes are sufficiently promising. Third, some advocacy strategies for the future are recommended.","Frankel, Sid","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43904-0_8","20200527","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1622,""

"Know Yourself: An Adaptive Causal Network Model for Therapeutic Intervention for Regaining Cognitive Control","Long term stress often causes depression and neuronal atrophies that in turn can lead to a variety of health problems. As a result of these cellular changes, also molecular changes occur. These changes, that include increase of glucocorticoids and decrease of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have the unfortunate effect that they decrease the cognitive abilities needed for the individual to solve the stressful situation. Such cognitive abilities like reappraisal and their adaptation mechanisms turn out to be substantially impaired while they are needed for regulation of the negative emotions. However, antidepressant treatments and some other therapies have proved to be quite effective for the strengthening of such cognitive abilities. This study introduces an adaptive causal network model for this phenomenon where a subject loses his or her cognitive abilities (negative metaplasticity) due to long-term stress and re-improve these cognitive abilities (positive metaplasticity) through mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Simulation results have been reported for demonstration of the phenomenon.","Ullah, Nimat; Treur, Jan","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49186-4_28","20200506","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1624,""

While many of the therapeutic skills leading to the effectiveness of face-to-face treatments are transferable, the effectiveness of telemental health requires unique skills. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to determine the experience of learning how to use videoconferencing to deliver relationally focused mental health care. Participants included 10 graduates of a COAMFTE-accredited master's degree program emphasizing training in telemental health. Each student had practicum placements that required videoconferencing to deliver relationally based psychotherapy.

None goes to states for public health or to substance use disorder treatment or prevention. Reporters covering the separate stories of the stimulus package and opioid overdoses never converged on coverage, and most of the opioid stories predicted that the pandemic would make the opioid crisis worse.

"Psychopharmakotherapie in Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie","In view of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patient care, including that of psychiatric patients, is facing unprecedented challenges. Treatment strategies for mental illness include psychotherapy and psychopharmacological interventions. The latter are associated with a multitude of adverse drug reactions (ADR); however, they may currently represent the preferred treatment due to restrictions regarding patient care (i.e. social distancing). Direct contact to patients may have to be reduced in favor of telephone calls or video conferences, so that new techniques in diagnosing and treating patients have to be established to guarantee patient safety. Patients should be extensively informed about relevant ADRs and physicians should actively ask patients about the timely recognition of ADRs. The use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an increased risk of developing ADRs, which are considered to be particularly unfavorable if they occur simultaneously with an acute infection or may even lead to an increased risk of infection. These include respiratory depression, agranulocytosis, intoxication by inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and venous thromboembolism, each of which may be associated with potentially fatal consequences; however, physicians should simultaneously ensure adequate efficacy of treatment, since the ongoing crisis may lead to a worsening of preexisting mental illnesses and to a surge in first onset of psychiatric disorders.","Seifert, J.; Heck, J.; Eckermann, G.; Singer, M.; Bleich, S.; Grohmann, R.; Toto, S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00115-020-00939-4","20200602","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1628,""
"Belief in Conspiracy Theory about COVID-19 Predicts Mental Health and Well-being -- A Study of Healthcare Staff in Ecuador","Abstract Objective: We aim to provide the first evidence of belief in conspiracy theory regarding the COVID-19 virus as a predictor of the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers. Methods: We conducted a survey of 252 healthcare workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. Results: In Ecuador, 32.54% of the sampled healthcare workers experienced distress disorder, and 28.17% had anxiety disorder. Compared to healthcare workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab reported higher levels of distress and anxiety, and lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Older healthcare workers and those who exercise more reported higher job satisfaction. Married healthcare workers, those who exercise more, and those not infected reported higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: This paper identifies belief in a COVID-19 conspiracy theory as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction of healthcare workers. It enables mental health services to better target and help mentally vulnerable healthcare workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, X.; Zhang, S. X.; Jahanshahi, A.

"A survey of the psychological status of primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Hangzhou China","Objective: To investigate the presence of social anxiety and depression and the risk factors for them among primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hangzhou China. Methods: A total of 1620 students who were quarantined at home for at least one month were recruited from two primary schools in Hangzhou. Students completed a questionnaire on a mobile App with help from their guardians; the measures included demographic and general information, the Social Anxiety Scale for Children (SASC), and the Depression Self-rating Scale for Children (DSRSC). Results: The mean SASC score of the participants was 3.90{+/-}3.73, which was higher than the mean norm score of Chinese urban children (3.48{+/-}3.47) (P < 0.01). The mean DSRSC score of the participants (5.67{+/-}4.97) was much lower than the mean norm score of Chinese urban children (9.84{+/-}4.73) (P < 0.05). A total of 279 (17.2%) students had social anxiety, with a mean score of 10.41{+/-}2.59, and 102 (6.3%) students had depression, with a mean score of 18.96{+/-}3.89. The following variables were found to be significant risk factors for social anxiety during home quarantine: deterioration of the parent-child relationship, increased conflicts with parents, irregular work and rest, and worrying more about being infected. Deterioration of the parent-child relationship, less physical activity, irregular work and rest, and negative mood during home quarantine were significant risk factors for depression. Conclusion: Primary school students who were quarantined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic were more likely to have social anxiety but less likely to have depressive symptoms. Poor parent-child relationships, irregularity of work and rest, and epidemic-related problems were the main reasons for psychological problems.

"Loneliness during lockdown: trajectories and predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 35,712 adults in the UK","There are increasing worries that lockdowns and stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a rise in loneliness, which is recognised as a major public health concern. But profiles of loneliness during the pandemic and risk factors remain unclear. Data from 35,712 UK adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the pandemic) were analysed from 21/03/2020-03/05/2020. The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Growth mixture modelling was used to identify the latent classes of loneliness growth trajectories and their predictors. Analyses revealed four classes, with the baseline loneliness level ranging from low to high. In the first six weeks of lockdown, loneliness levels increased in the highest loneliness group, decreased in the lowest loneliness group, and stayed relatively constant in the middle two groups. Younger adults (OR=2.17-6.81), women (OR=1.59), people with low income (OR=1.3), the economically inactive (OR=1.3-2.04) and people with mental health conditions (OR=5.32) were more likely to be in highest loneliness class relative to the lowest. Further, living with others or in a rural area, and having more close friends or greater social support were protective. Perceived levels of loneliness in the first few weeks of lockdown during COVID-19 were relatively stable in the UK, but for many people these levels were high with no signs of improvement.

"COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Measuring differences in individual precautionary behaviors among young adults","Aim: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already hit Bangladesh, and various control measures have been taken to flatten the epidemic curve. Due to the current demographic distribution in Bangladesh, young adults are vital to the demography of the country. Therefore, their precautionary behavior is very important to ensure the success of preventive policies. This exploratory study examined the differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors among young adults, and estimated and compared the predictors of precautionary behavior adoption among young adults living in the capital city Dhaka and a nearby district, Tangail. Subject and Methods: A total of 350 respondents from each district participated in the study. ANOVA and two-sample t-tests were utilized to detect differences in precautionary behavior across demographic groups of young adults, and quantile regression modeling was used to find the predictors of adopting precautionary behaviors and to compare these predictors between the two districts. Results: Individuals who had a postgraduate education and had good mental health tended to show better precautionary behaviors in Dhaka. Female respondents from Tangail who had no psychological distress took precautionary behaviors more often than their counterparts. However, no significant differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among young adults were found between the two districts. Better self-control ability, higher education, and good mental health emerged as factors that significantly shaped the precautionary behaviors of young adults in this study. Conclusion: Having better knowledge did not ensure better adoption of precautionary behaviors among the participants. In effect, strong intervention by the government to keep people at home and distant from each other and continued lockdown for several more days are probable immediate solutions. At the same time, the economic burden on lower-income people should be addressed.","Imtiaz, A.; Hossain, M. A.; Khan, N.

"BCG vaccination and socioeconomic variables vs Covid-19 global features: clearing up a controversial issue","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic is characterized by extreme variability in the outcome distribution and mortality rates across different countries. Some recent studies suggested an inverse correlation with BCG vaccination at population level, while others denied this hypothesis. In order to address this controversial issue, we performed a strict epidemiological study collecting data available on a global scale, considering additional variables such as cultural-political factors and adherence to other vaccination coverages. Methods: Data on 121 countries, accounting for about 99% of Covid-19 cases and deaths globally, were from John's Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations, Human Freedom Report, and BCG Atlas. Statistical models used were Ordinary Least Squares, Tobit and Fractional Probit, implemented on Stata/MP16 software. Results: Based on our results, countries where BCG vaccination is or has been mandated in the last decades have seen a drastic reduction in Covid-19 diffusion (-80% on average) and mortality (-50% on average), even controlling for relative wealth of countries and their governmental health expenditure. A significant contribution to this reduction (respectively -50% and -13% on average) was also associated to the outbreak onset during summer, suggesting a possible influence of seasonality. Other variables turned out to be associated, though to a lesser extent. Conclusions: Relying on a very large dataset and a wide array of control variables, our study confirms a strong and robust association between Covid-19 diffusion and mortality with BCG vaccination and a set socio-economic factors, opening new perspectives for clinical speculations and public health policies.","Ventura, L.; Vitali, M.; Romano Spica, V.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20107755","20200526","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1635,""
"Paradigms about the COVID-2 pandemic: knowledge, attitudes and practices from medical students","Background: As the disease caused by the new coronavirus has spread globally, economic instability in healthcare systems has been significant, and the lack of knowledge, attitudes and practices among people has led the magnification of this disease. This reality is more accentuated especially in Ecuador, where, although many healthcare workers have been called to help in the regions most affected; the shortage of them combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors have led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation on the front line of the last year medical students are indispensable. For that reason, appropriate training on COVID-19 to last year medical students is an urgent need that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices in Ecuadorian last year medical students in order to identify the knowledge gaps, perceptions and behavior patterns, which could guide the design of better medical educational curricula on COVID-19. Methods: This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 20 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian last year medical students. It was sent by email and by Facebook and WhatsApp. Results: A total of 309 students answered the survey. 88% (274/309) of students scored high about knowledge of the disease (more than 16 points). The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of the COVID-19 in Ecuador and volunteering during the outbreak in 77% (238/309) and 58% (179/309) of the students, respectively. Moreover 91% (280/309) of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment, neither training in their health facilities (49%, 152/309). Conclusions: The high level of students knowledge is an important opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training toward COVID-19. Creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways for all students to be trained. Hopefully with this, negative attitudes will change and students will be better qualified.

"Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and COVID-19: systematic review and narrative synthesis of efficacy and safety","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has required clinicians to urgently identify new treatment options or the repurposing of existing drugs. Several drugs are now being repurposed with the aim of identifying if these drugs provide some level of disease resolution. Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), first developed as an antimalarial therapy. There is increasing concern with regards to the efficacy and safety of these agents. The aims of this review are to systematically identify and collate studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Methods and Findings: Searches for (COVID AND chloroquine [title/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) and two (COVID AND hydroxychloroquine[title/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) yielded 272 unique articles. Unique articles were manually checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria and also subjected to a quality appraisal assessment. A total of 19 articles were included in the systematic review. Seventy-five percent of observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy recorded no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes, between COVID-19 patients given a range of CQ and/or HCQ doses, and the control groups. All clinical trials and 82% of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Seventy-five percent of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects found a greater incidence among patients administered a wide range of CQ and/or HCQ doses, with QTc prolongation the most common finding, in addition to its consequences of VT and cardiac arrest. Of the total studies using mortality rate as an end-point, 60% reported no significant change in the risk of death, while 30% showed an elevation, and 10% a depression, in treated relative to control patients. Conclusion: The strongest available evidence suggests that, relative to standard in-hospital management of symptoms, the use of CQ and HCQ to treat hospitalised COVID-19 patients has likely been unsafe. At the very least, the poor quality of data failing to find any significant changes in the risk of VT should preclude definitive judgment on drug safety until the completion of high-quality randomised clinical trials.","takla, M.; Jeevaratnam, K.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.20115741","20200530","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1637,""
"Assessing visible aerosol generation during vitrectomy in the era of Covid-19","Objective: To assess visible aerosol generation during simulated vitrectomy surgery. Methods: A model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber was used. Three-port 25 gauge vitrectomy simulated surgery was performed with any visible aerosol production recorded using high speed 4K camera. The following were assessed: (1) vitrector at maximum cut rate in static and dynamic conditions inside the model, (2) vitrector at air-fluid interface in physical model, (3) passive fluid-air exchange with a backflush hand piece, (4) valved cannulas under air, and (5) defective valved cannula under air. Results: No visible aerosol or droplets were identified when the vitrector was used within the model. In the physical model, no visible aerosol or droplets were seen when the vitrector was engaged at the air-fluid interface. Droplets were produced from the opening of backflush hand piece during passive fluid-air exchange. No visible aerosol was produced from the intact valved cannulas under air pressure, but droplets were seen at the beginning of fluid-air exchange when the valved cannula was defective. Conclusions: We found no evidence of visible aerosol generation during simulated vitrectomy surgery with competent valved cannulas. In the physical model, no visible aerosol was generated by the high-speed vitrector despite cutting at the air-fluid interface.","Liyanage, S.

"Emotional distress and associated sociodemographic risk factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain","Background Spain is one of the countries that has been most affected by COVID-19 disease. However, the emotional distress on the Spanish population remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of emotional disorders and related symptoms and to assess the influence of sociodemographic characteristics on this population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey using an online platform. Participation was completely voluntary. Sociodemographic variables were collected and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic were assessed through three questionnaires: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-Panic Disorder (PHQ-PD). Chi-squared statistics were applied to determine the influence of sociodemographic variables on symptom severity and diagnosis. Results Most respondents (n=1753) were female (76.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 (12.9) years; 39.1% were married and 39.5% held a high school degree. Severe and moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression were high (6.5% and 14.3%; 9.9% and 12.9%, respectively) and more than one in four participants (25.7%) experienced a panic attack. A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD; 12.2% for MDD; and 17.2% for PD. Significant risk factors were as follows: female, young adult, single, unemployed, and low income. Conclusion Due to limitations related to the study design (convenience sample), the findings of these study may not be applicable to the general population. Nonetheless, the high prevalence of emotional symptoms and disorders in this sample suggests that mental health interventions are urgently needed in Spain.","Munoz-Navarro, R.; Cano-Vindel, A.; Schmitz, F.; Cabello, R.; Fernandez-Berrocal, P.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117457","20200530","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1639,""
"Predictors of misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of Saudi population and its impact: a cross-sectional study","Objectives: To explore the predictors of misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of the Saudi population and its impact. Design: An online cross-sectional study. Setting: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Participants: A total of 2006 participants [953(47.5%) females, and 1053(52.5%) males], and more than 18 years of age were included in the study. Data collection and analysis: This cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University (KAU). The participants were approached by social media (SM). An online questionnaire was administered, and the data were analyzed on SPSS-26. Results: The SM was the leading source of information 889(43.9%). Two-thirds of the participants, 1250(66.9%) had various misconceptions, and about one-third of the study participants 637(31.7%) had disturbed social, mental, and psychological wellbeing, and many participants became more religious. Two-thirds of the study participants, 1292(68.1%) had good knowledge score. The attitude was highly positive in 1867(93.1%) participants, and the practice score was adequate in 1939(97.7%). The participants educational status was the predictor of good knowledge. Male gender and divorced ones were the predictor of poor practice scores and age 51-60 years, private jobholders, and students were the predictors of the good practice scores. The Saudi nationality was the predictor of participants positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced ones were predictors of a negative attitude. The male gender and higher education status were the predictors of good concepts, while the older age and job (own business) were the predictors of misconceptions. Conclusion: Our study observed several predictors of misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices among the Saudi population. Our participants had a good realization of the impact of this pandemic.","Baig, M.; Jameel, T.; Alzahrani, S. H.; Mirza, A. A.; Gazzaz, Z. J.; Ahmad, T.; Baig, F.; Almurashi, S.

"Mechanistic rationale of drugs, Primary endpoints, Geographical distribution of clinical trials against Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2: A Systematic Review","Objective To do a systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials that are assessing various therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 with an aim to provide insight into the various interventions tested, clinical rationale, geographical distribution of the trials as well as the endpoints assessed in the studies. Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of the ongoing clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2. Data sources ClinicalTrials.gov, World health organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Cochrane COVID registry were assessed till May 11th 2020. Study selection Studies on any intervention based randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective clinical studies on SARS-CoV-2 in patients [=]18 years of age. Studies on autopsy series, preclinical studies, diagnostic methods, mathematical modelling, epidemiology and health services research, pediatric populations were excluded. Data extraction The data was extracted by two authors independently into pre-defined forms based on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The data was extracted on various domains such as trial number, study title, abstract of the study, interventions assessed, sample size, phase of the study, study sponsor, primary endpoint assessed and country of study. Results The search resulted in 3242 ongoing studies of which 829 studies were included. There are 134 different drug-based interventions being assessed in 463 clinical trials as treatment options. Seventy-two studies assessed preventive options of which 53 are drug-based prophylaxis and 19 assessed vaccines. Herbal medicines are being assessed in 79 studies; convalescent plasma therapy in 56 studies; stem cell based interventions in 42 studies; anesthesia-based interventions in 31 studies, machine-based interventions in 24 studies, mental health- based interventions in18 studies, rehabilitation based interventions in 12 studies and miscellaneous interventions in 32 studies. China accounts for 35% of all ongoing clinical studies followed by USA 23%, France 7%, Spain 3.3%,Canada 2%, multi-country studies account only for 1.5% (13) and other countries together account for 28%.Amongst the 463 studies assessing drug-based treatment options, studies that are funded by federal and academic institutions are 79.6%, pharmaceutical company funded studies are 15.11% and no funding information is available in 5.10%. The definitive outcomes like mortality are being assessed as primary outcome in 22.8% of the studies only and need for ventilator in 6.2% of the studies. Rest of the studies has primary outcomes such as clinical recovery (15.9%), viral clearance(17.4%), time to recovery (10.1%), oxygen improvement (5.6%), ICU admission (1.9%), lab and imaging(6.4%), adverse effects (5.3%) and symptom reduction(1.5%),no outcome reported(6.2%) which account for 71% of the studies. Amongst the pharmaceutical company funded drug-based studies, only 20% of the studies had mortality as the primary outcome. Only 5.5% of the ongoing clinical trials are specifically designed to assess the most vulnerable population like elderly, patients with comorbidities and cancer. The most common intervention being tested against COVID-19 are antimalarial medications with 105 clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine is the most common drug being tested with 83 ongoing studies. Conclusion Multiple intervention based clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2 are being performed throughout the world with a high concentration of clinical trials in the developed world. There is a high concern that most of the studies maybe repetitive; elderly and patients with comorbidities are being underrepresented; definite endpoints like mortality are being assessed in only one-fifth of the studies.","Venkatesulu, B.

"Psychosocial factors and hospitalisations for COVID-19: Prospective cohort study of the general population","Objective: To examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: England. Participants: UK Biobank comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Main outcome measure: Hospitalisation for COVID-19 in England between 16th March and 26th April 2020 as provided by Public Health England. Results: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 people. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function: verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend <=0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). Conclusion: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function was most robust to statistical adjustment.","Batty, G.

"Psychological impact of Covid-19 lockdown in India: Different strokes for different folks","The psychological impact of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic are widely documented. In India, a family-centric society with a high population density and extreme social stratification, the impact of the lockdown might vary across diverse social groups. However, the patterning in the psychological impact of the lockdown among sexual minorities and persons known to be at higher risk of contracting Covid-19 is not known in the Indian context. We used mixed methods (online survey, n=282 and in-depth interviews, n=14) to investigate whether the psychological impact of the lockdown was different across these groups of Indian adults. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Thematic analysis helped us identify emergent themes in our qualitative narratives. Anxiety was found to be higher among sexual minorities ({beta}=2.44, CI: 0.58, 4.31), high-risk group ({beta}=2.20, CI:0.36, 4.05), and those with history of depression/loneliness ({beta}=3.89, CI:2.34, 5.44). Addiction to pornography was also found to be higher among sexual minorities ({beta}=2.72, CI: 0.09, 5.36). Qualitative findings suggested that sexual minorities likely used pornography and masturbation to cope with the lockdown, given the limited physical access to sexual partners in a society that stigmatizes homosexuality. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative study findings suggested that greater frequency of calling family members during lockdown could strengthen social relationships and increase social empathy. The study thereby urgently calls for the attention of policymakers to take sensitive and inclusive health decisions for the marginalized and the vulnerable, both during and after the crisis.","Sharma, A.

"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Pakistani University Students and How They Are Coping","Background: COVID-19 is spreading quickly, causing great deal of fear and unrest in the public. Methods: This web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among students of four renowned Pakistani education institutions. Google forms were used to disseminate the online questionnaire to assess anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale), depression (9-item patient health questionnaire), sources of distress (14-items) and the coping strategies (Brief-COPE). Results: A total of 1134 responses (age 21.7 {+/-} 3.5 years, 70.5% females) were included. The frequency of students having moderate-severe anxiety and depression (score [=] 10) were {approx} 34% and 45%, respectively. The respondents aged [=] 31 years had significantly lower depression score than those below 30 years. Males had significantly less anxiety and depression scores than females. Additionally, those having a family member, friend or acquaintance infected with disease had significantly higher anxiety score. The main sources of distress were related to adverse effects of ongoing pandemic on daily life followed by the rapid disease spread. Regarding coping strategies, majority of respondents were found to have adopted religious/spiritual coping followed by acceptance. Conclusions: COVID-19 have significant adverse impact on students' mental health. The most frequent coping strategy adopted by them are religious/spiritual coping, acceptance, self-distraction and active coping. It is suggested that mental health of students should not be neglected during epidemics.","Salman, M.; Asif, N.; Mustafa, Z. U.; Khan, T. M.; Shehzadi, N.; Hussain, K.; Tahir, H.; Raza, M.

"Feeling Like It is Time to Reopen Now? COVID-19 New Normal Scenarios based on Reopening Sentiment Analytics","The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances. This research discovers public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the US economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time sensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new normal future.","Samuel, Jim; Rahman, Md.

"Mental health outcomes and associations during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey of the US general population","Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to significant mental health stresses, potentially with modifiable risk factors. To determine the presence of and magnitude of associations between baseline associations and anxiety and depression in the US general population, we performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race- stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 45 (16), and 494 (48.8%) were male. Baseline demographic data were similar between those that were (n=663, 66.2%) and were not (n=339, 33.8%) under a shelter in place/ stay at home order, with the exception of sex and geographic location. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%) meeting clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.49, 0.87]) and living in a larger home (OR 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. Rural location (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03, 1.89]), loneliness (OR 4.92, 95% CI [3.18, 7.62]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.04, 95% CI [1.38, 3.03]), were associated with increased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. 232 subjects (23.6%) met criteria for clinical depression. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.71, 95% CI [0.53, 0.95]), increased time outdoors (OR 0.51, 95% CI [0.29, 0.92]), and living in a larger home (OR 0.35, 95% CI [0.18, 0.69]), were associated with decreased odds of meeting depression criteria. Having lost a job (OR 1.64, 95% CI [1.05, 2.54]), loneliness (OR 10.42, 95% CI [6.26, 17.36]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.42, 95% CI [1.62, 3.62]), were associated with an increased odds of meeting depression criteria.

"Panique et pandÃ©mie: revue de la littÃ©rature sur les liens entre le trouble panique et l'Ã©pidÃ©mie Ã  SARS-CoV-2","RÃ©sumÃ© Lâ€™Ã©tat de panique associÃ© Ã  la pandÃ©mie liÃ©e au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite Ã  sâ€™interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait gÃ©nÃ©rer ou aggraver. Si la littÃ©rature a dÃ©jÃ  fourni des projections gÃ©nÃ©ralistes en la matiÃ¨re, les donnÃ©es concrÃ¨tes concernent Ã  ce stage davantage le trouble de stress post-traumatique et le trouble obsessionnel compulsif, tandis que quelques Ã©valuations sâ€™intÃ©ressent au cadre nosographie du trouble anxieux gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©. Le trouble panique ne se voit que peu ou pas citÃ© et lâ€™Ã©vocation de la Â« panique Â», au sens social, la supplante largement. Bien que dâ€™une lÃ©gitimitÃ© clinique encore dÃ©battue, le trouble panique qualifiÃ© de Â« respiratoire Â» pourrait se voir augmenter en nombre et/ou Ãªtre intensifiÃ© chez les patients qui en prÃ©sentent dÃ©jÃ . Dâ€™Ã©ventuelles situations co-morbides entre un tel trouble et la COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) doivent inciter Ã  certaines prÃ©cautions en matiÃ¨re de prescriptions mÃ©dicamenteuses, notamment en lien avec les traitements, ou situations, sources dâ€™hypokaliÃ©mie : (i) le salbutamol, source potentielle de surconsommation, notamment chez les patients anxieux, (ii) lâ€™infection par le SARS-CoV-2 et plus encore en cas de diarrhÃ©es et/ou vomissements. Lâ€™hypokaliÃ©mie est associÃ©e Ã  un risque accru de torsade de pointe, il convient donc Ã©galement dâ€™Ãªtre prudent en matiÃ¨re de prescription de psychotropes Ã  risque : comme avec le citalopram et lâ€™escitalopram, des antidÃ©presseurs indiquÃ©s dans le trouble panique, ou encore lâ€™hydroxyzine, Ã  visÃ©e anxiolytique. Ces donnÃ©es sont de nature Ã  resituer lâ€™importance de la prise en considÃ©ration du trouble panique dans le cadre de la pandÃ©mie en cours. Abstract Although the â€˜panicâ€™ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder â€“ i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities â€“ are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010","20200521","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1648,""
"Videokonsultationen durch Psychotherapeuten in Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie: Wirksamkeit, Gestaltung des Settings und erste Erfahrungen aus einer Machbarkeitsstudie sowie mit dem Routineangebot im Krankenhaus","Due to the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the resulting constraints on personal (i.e. face to face) treatment, video consultations have recently gained a major role in the delivery of healthcare services; however, until now, most psychotherapists have little experience with conducting video consultations, not least because of poor possibilities for reimbursement from the statutory health insurance. This article provides (1) an overview of the effectiveness of psychotherapy interventions delivered via video consultations for depression and anxiety disorders, (2) recommendations for setting up and conducting these consultations and (3) first experiences of psychotherapists from a German feasibility study and from the provision in routine care in hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Haun, Markus W.; Hoffmann, Mariell; TÃ¶nnies, Justus; Dinger, Ulrike; Hartmann, Mechthild; Friederich, Hans-Christoph","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00278-020-00438-6","20200526","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1649,""
"The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers under the Outbreak of COVID-19","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (FMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, and make a comparison with non-FMW. METHODS: The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. RESULTS: A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3Â±3.8 vs 7.5Â±3.7; P<0.001; Cohen's d=0.47), AIS (6.9Â±4.3 vs 5.3Â±3.8; P<0.001; Cohen's d=0.38), anxiety (4.9Â±2.7 vs 4.3Â±2.6; P<0.001; Cohen's d= 0.22) and depression (4.1Â±2.5 vs 3.6Â±2.4; P=0.001; Cohen's d=0.21), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR]= 1.29; P<0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR=1.45; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: FMW have higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-FMW. Further interventions should be administrated for FMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle against COVID-19.","Qi, Jing; Xu, Jing; Li, Bo-Zhi; Huang, Jin-Sha; Yang, Yuan; Zhang, Zhen-Tao; Yao, Dong-Ai; Liu, Qun-Hui; Jia, Min; Gong, Dao-Kai; Ni, Xiao-Hong; Zhang, Qi-Mei; Shang, Fu-Rong; Xiong, Nian; Zhu, Chun-Li; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xi","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.023","20200523","","Elsevier; PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1650,""
"The educational value of outpatient CL rotations- a white paper from the ACLP residency education subcommittee","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As mental health services in outpatient medical clinics expand, psychiatrists must be trained to practice in these settings. The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (ACLP) residency education subcommittee convened a writing group with the goal of summarizing the current evidence about outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and providing a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. METHOD: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and PsycINFO (via OVID), were reviewed each from inception to December 2019, for psychiatric CLP services in ambulatory settings that involved residents or fellows. The CLP education guidelines were reviewed for recommendations relevant to outpatient CLP. We also searched MedEd portal for published curriculums relevant to CLP. The group held 2 conferences to reach consensus about recommendations in setting up outpatient CLP rotations. RESULTS: Seventeen articles, three ACLP supported guidelines, and eight online didactic resources were identified as directly reporting on the organization and/or impact of an outpatient CLP rotation. These manuscripts indicated that residents found outpatient CLP rotations effective and relevant to their future careers. However, the literature provided few recommendations for establishing formal outpatient CLP training experiences. DISCUSSION: Outpatient CLP rotations offer multiple benefits for trainees, including exposure to specific clinical scenarios and therapeutic interventions applicable only in the outpatient setting, increased continuity of care and the unique experience of providing liaison and education to non-mental health providers. The article outlines recommendations and examples for developing outpatient CLP rotations which CLP educators can incorporate in their programs.","Zimbrean, Paula C.; Ernst, Carrie L.; Forray, Ariadna; Beach, Scott R.; Lavakumar, Mallika; Siegel, Andrew M.; Soeprono, Thomas; Schwartz, Ann C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.004","20200519","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1651,""
"Using Latent Class Analysis to Identify the Complex Needs of Youth on Probation","Youth involved with the juvenile justice system have higher rates of unmet social and psychological service needs than the general population. Yet, scant research has addressed the potentially complex needs of youth on probation. This study is thus a first step in improving our ability to promote positive youth development and improved outcomes from youth on probation. It uses administrative data on probation youth from FY2011-2013 in a mid-Atlantic state. We estimated latent class models based on the ordinal scoring (high, moderate, none/low) of the 25 subscales from a standardized assessment administered at intake. In order to test whether groups were distinct, we examined a range of variables, including the official risk classification and recidivism rates measured by officieal rearrests and reconvictions. We report the demographic differences between the estimated groups, as well as adverse childhood experiences, school and employment status, previous legal history, and substance use history. Ultimately, the seven-class model produced four groups that others have noted: a relatively low needs (lowest need), relatively high needs (complex needs), substance use service needs, and mental health service needs. The other three groups that emerged include two gender specific groups (one for male and one for female high-need groups) and a group with skills needs that lacks supportive and protective skills. The analyses will facilitate a better appreciation for the service needs of moderate risk youth. Youth on probation are not a uniform population; they reflect tremendous heterogeneity, and probation systems should embrace systemic responsivity to provide appropriate services to improve youth outcomes. Advancing efforts to provide a broader spectrum of services that address multi-morbid conditions can ensure that youth have opportunities to improve their quality of life during the period of supervision.","Lee, JoAnn; Taxman, Faye","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105087","20200519","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1652,""
"Enfermement carcÃ©ral, confinement socio-sanitaire et moyens dâ€™Ã©vasionDanser sa peine et au-delÃ â€¦","Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic are compared through the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by ValÃ©rie MÃ¼ller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The womenâ€™s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivityâ€¦ move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population â€“ youth to elderlyâ€“try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cookingâ€¦ through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems. A panel of situations goes from deleterious conflictual relationships, dramatic isolation, to funny and positive ones using creativeness to escape, facing the disruption of daily life.","Vaysse, Jocelyne; Poli, Antonella","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.002","20200519","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1653,""
"The emergency reaction questionnaire â€“ First steps towards a new method","During emergencies, people are more or less capable of performing adequately. Knowledge about human behavior while facing emergencies has become more significant nowadays. This knowledge can help improving our already present defensive responses and natural coping mechanisms when facing imminent dangers, natural disasters, and catastrophes. A new method is here offered to explore the core points of this topic. The Emergency Reaction Questionnaire (ERQ), is proposed for predicting one's reaction and behaviour in an emergency. First, a large item pool was created based on interviews with people facing emergencies on a weekly basis and related literature. The factor structure, reliability and validity were assessed on a large sample of lay people (N = 1115, 440 males) and specific groups of firefighters and people doing extreme sports (N = 85, all males). Participants were Caucasian with an age range of 18â€“70. We also used measures of anxiety, depression, and sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition and activation and coping in stressful situations. The ERQ was proved to be reliable and consistent in time and having sound psychometric properties both on the community and special samples. Results show that psychometric properties are satisfying; the test has excellent validity ratings. Consequently, the ERQ can be used in future research effectively and facilitate a better understanding of how people react in a highly dangerous situation. Future directions in the utilization of the new method are discussed.","Zsido, Andras N.; Csokasi, Krisztina; Vincze, Orsolya; Coelho, Carlos M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101684","20200522","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1654,""
"The putative etiology and prevention of autism","Since the initial psychological report by Leo Kanner in 1943, relatively little formal biochemical/neurological research on the cause of autism, other than peripheral searches for genomic mutations, had been carried until the end of the 20th century. As a result of studies on twin sets and the conclusion that autism was largely a hereditary defect, numerous investigations have sought various genetic faults in particular. However, such studies were able to reveal a plausible etiology for this malady in only a small percentage of instances. Key bio-molecular characteristics of this syndrome have been uncovered when the potential roles of the glia were studied in depth. Findings related to biochemical deficiencies appearing early in the newborn, such as depressed IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor #1) in neurogenesis/myelination, are becoming emphasized in many laboratories. Progress leading to timely diagnoses and subsequent prevention of central nervous system dysconnectivity now seems plausible. The tendency for an infant to develop autism may currently be determinable and preventable before irreversible psychosocial disturbances become established. These discussions about glial function will be inter-spersed with comments about their apparent relevance to autism. The concluding portion of this presentation will be a detailed review and summation of this diagnosis and prevention proposition.","Steinman, Gary","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.013","20200510","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1655,""
"Psychological influence of Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the general public, medical workers and patients with mental disorders and its countermeasures","Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019, and now it spreads in more than 100 countries around the world. On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency (PHEIC) of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by (WHO) of the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020 showed that general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg). Therefore, while controlling the pandemic, the government should also pay attention to the mental health of the general public, medical workers and patients with mental disorders. Community mental health service system, online mental health service, telemedicine and other measures for patients with mental disorders may play a vital role during the pandemic.","Wang, Sanwang; Wen, Xin; Liu, Bin; Dong, Yingying; Cui, Ming hu","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.005","20200522","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1656,""
"Impact of Covid-19 on training and wellbeing in subspecialty surgery: a national survey of cardiothoracic trainees in the United Kingdom","Structured Abstract Objectives The Covid-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems and disrupted routine care internationally. Healthcare workers face disruption to their work routines and professional development, as well as an elevated risk of infection and morbidity. We sought to establish the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the wellbeing, practice and progression of all trainees in cardiothoracic surgery in the United Kingdom. Methods A 31-item questionnaire was designed, validated, and disseminated via email and an instant-messaging platform. Results 76 (of 118, 64%) cardiothoracic surgical trainees responded, representing all training grades and programmes nationally. 48 (63%) and 24 (32%) were concerned about their physical and mental health respectively. 25 (33%) had taken time off work due to Covid-19. 65 (86%) had treated Covid-19 patients, 36 of whom (55%) were wearing satisfactory personal protective equipment at the time. 41 (54%) remain concerned about PPE provision at their institution. 42 (55%) had been redeployed to cover other specialties. 23 (30%) had encountered ethical dilemmas related to care of patients. There was a significant impact on time spent in outpatient clinics (44% reduction), multidisciplinary team meetings (79% reduction) and operating theatres (78% reduction). 67 (88%) of respondents were concerned about the impact on their training, and 54 (71%) felt that the deviation may require an extension in their planned training time. Conclusions The duration and impact of the current pandemic is, as yet, uncertain. Timely sharing of experiences, concerns and expectations will inform healthcare and education policy, and influence practice in the pandemic era and beyond.","Caruana, Edward J.; Patel, Akshay; Kendall, Simon; Rathinam, Sridhar","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.05.052","20200601","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1657,""

"Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals","Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management. Purpose This statement aims to summarise some of the potential mental health and psychosocial challenges that may arise in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oâ€™Neil, Adriene; Nicholls, Stephen J.; Redfern, Julie; Brown, Alex; Hare, David L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.05.002","20200521","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1659,""
"Insomnia during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: Prevalence, severity, and associated risk factors in France population","In response to Voitsidis et al. (2020) published in Psychiatry Research addressing the paucity of research on insomnia during a pandemic, we obtained data from an online cross-sectional survey by documenting the prevalence of clinical insomnia and its contributing factors in a French general public sample. Participants (N= 556) completed the Insomnia Severity Index, UCLA Loneliness scale, and provided information on sociodemographics, antecedents of mental and physical health conditions, and COVID-19-related stressful life events. In our sample, 19.1% met the diagnostic criteria of clinical insomnia, which was twice lower than that reported in Voitsidis et al., but close to those found among Chinese and Italian populations. We confirmed COVID-19-related worries and loneliness to be the major contributing factors to clinical insomnia, in addition to education status, being infected by the virus and pre-existing mental health illness. These findings underscore that sleep-related problems should be an important component of mental health interventions during pandemics.","Kokou-Kpolou, Cyrille Kossigan; Megalakaki, Olga; Laimou, Dimitra; Kousouri, Marina","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113128","20200526","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-04","",1660,""
