"Domestic energy-saving behavior index as sustainability indicator: Are Russians ready for sacrifices to protect the environment?","In recent years, it became clear that the human unsustainable behavioursâ€™ impact on the environment. Environment protected behavior is especially relevant in the context of the current epidemiological situation ushered by the COVID-19. Environmental awareness is becoming a part of everyday life. The time has come when it is necessary to sacrifice the comfort for the future of the planet. This study primarily focuses on the attitudes of residents of a typical Russian industrial city towards environmental issues and the use of the Energy-Saving Behavior Index (ESBI) as an environmental indicator of sustainable behavior. Our work investigates ESBI and the factors which are associated with domestic energy-saving behavior. We surveyed 599 people in Chelyabinsk, Russia. We studied (1) the socio-demographic factors of residents and their households, (2) mental health and subjective well-being (SWB), and (3) physical health. The study showed that the overwhelming majority of residents of a typical Russian city are extremely dissatisfied with the state of the environment (more than 80% of respondents) and 70% of them believe that they can contribute to improving the situation. However, Russians are still wasteful in household energy consumption. It has been shown that unstable behavior is due to psychological factors and has a compensatory mechanism that is connected with the â€œfeelings-emotions-behaviorâ€ sequence.","Krupnova, Tatyana G.; Rakova, Olga V.; Shefer, Ekaterina A.; Semenenko, Dmitry P.; Saifullin, Artem F.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2022.100209","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environmental and Sustainability Indicators;JOUR: 100209,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40875,""

"Life experience of Health Sciences teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic in Peru","This study's objective was to analyze Peruvian university teachers' life experience in the area of Health Sciences during the Covid-19 pandemic. The research design was non-experimental, qualitative, and analytical. The total number of participants was defined by purposive sampling, totaling 9 participants, 5 men and 4 women in an age range between 36 and 57 years selected by sampling. The inclusion criterion was active teachers in University Institutions in the cities of Lima - El Callao, during the months of October to December 2021;having practiced teaching with more than 10 years of experience in the area of health, open to all subareas, medicine, dentistry, nursing, among others, in both private and public Institutions. Participants were contacted through the social networks WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, and through the web portals of each University;data collection was carried out through the semi-structured interview technique, and the interviews were conducted via the web;using Zoom software. The Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis provided the referential framework for the in-depth exploration of the different narratives. The results yielded the grouping of 8 main themes and 25 associated codes. The study concludes that the university teachers participating in the study expressed that their life experience during the pandemic was marked by manifestations of stress, suffering from anxiety, uncertainty, and depression. However, the analysis showed a clear tendency of the interviewees to look to the future with optimism and hope, identifying a marked resilience in regard to the effects of the pandemic and dedication to their work despite the difficulties they faced.","Vina, C.

"Non-invasive ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, including COVID-19","Optimal initial non-invasive management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), of both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 etiologies, has been the subject of significant discussion. Avoidance of endotracheal intubation reduces related complications, but maintenance of spontaneous breathing with intense respiratory effort may increase risks of patientsâ€™ self-inflicted lung injury, leading to delayed intubation and worse clinical outcomes. High-flow nasal oxygen is currently recommended as the optimal strategy for AHRF management for its simplicity and beneficial physiological effects. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), delivered as either pressure support or continuous positive airway pressure via interfaces like face masks and helmets, can improve oxygenation and may be associated with reduced endotracheal intubation rates. However, treatment failure is common and associated with poor outcomes. Expertise and knowledge of the specific features of each interface are necessary to fully exploit their potential benefits and minimize risks. Strict clinical and physiological monitoring is necessary during any treatment to avoid delays in endotracheal intubation and protective ventilation. In this narrative review, we analyze the physiological benefits and risks of spontaneous breathing in AHRF, and the characteristics of tools for delivering NIV. The goal herein is to provide a contemporary, evidence-based overview of this highly relevant topic.","RosÃ , Tommaso, Menga, Luca Salvatore, Tejpal, Ambika, Cesarano, Melania, Michi, Teresa, Sklar, Michael C.; Grieco, Domenico Luca","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jointm.2022.08.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Intensive Medicine;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40878,""
"Stumbling from One Disaster to Another: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health Calls for Police Service across Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on crime in Canada and internationally. However, less is known about the impact of the pandemic on police-reported mental-health-related incidents. We explore three types of mental-health-related incidents (suicide and suicide attempts, Mental Health Act apprehensions, and mental health [other]) against property and violent crimes, across 13 police jurisdictions in Canada. Despite an international decline in most crime types during COVID-19, we find general stability across police-reported mental-health-related incidents. These findings suggest that the change in social behaviour that reduced opportunities for crime did not have a similar effect on mental-health-related incidents. It also suggests that calls for increased police budgets to respond to expected increases in mental-health-related incidents may be unjustified.","Andresen, Martin, Hodgkinson, Tarah","https://doi.org/10.3138/cjccj.2022-0016","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40879,""
"The Long Tail of COVID 19: Implications for the Future of ED Nursing","Objective To understand the perspectives of emergency nursesâ€™ perception of psychological trauma during COVID 19 and protective mechanisms used to build resilience. Method The primary method was qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews, with survey data on general resilience, moral resilience, and traumatic stress used to triangulate and understand qualitative findings. Analyses and theme development were guided by Social Identity Theory and informed by the Mid-Range Theory of Nursesâ€™ Psychological Trauma. Results A total of 14 emergency department (ED) nurses were interviewed, 11 from one site and 3 from the other. Almost all nurses described working in an ED throughout the pandemic as extraordinarily stressful, morally injurious, and exhausting at multiple levels. While the source of stressors changed throughout the pandemic, the culmination of continued stress, moral injury, and emotional and physical exhaustion almost always exceeded their ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape in healthcare created by the pandemic. Two primary themes were identified: Losing Identity as a Nurse and Hopelessness and Self-Preservation. Conclusion The consequences of the pandemic on nurses are likely to be long-lasting. Nurses need to mend and rebuild their identity as a nurse. The solutions are not quick fixes but rather will require fundamental changes in the profession, healthcare organizations and society. These changes will require a strategic vision, sustained commitment, and leadership to accomplish.","Holtz, Heidi, Weissinger, Guy M.; Swavely, Deborah, Lynn, Lisa, Yoder, Angela, Cotton, Bridgette, Adil, Thomas, Alderfer, Mary, Romig, Barb, Neils, Kristen, Rushton, Cynda Hylton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2022.10.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Emergency Nursing;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40880,""
"Psychological impacts on the travel behaviour post Covid-19","The present study investigates the behavioural impact of COVID-19 on commuter's mobility. For this purpose, an online questionnaire survey was prepared, which was circulated in Delhi, India. More than 200 respondents participated in the survey. The information regarding travel patterns, working, mental health, and psychological stress are obtained for pre, during and post-COVID-19 periods. The results highlight that a significant number of commuters stated to shift their choice of commuting from shared modes to private modes of transport in the post-COVID-19 period. About 28.7% of persons who change their modes are likely to use it for a more extended period. Due to lockdown, 65% of people who are working/studying from home expressed to resume offline mode after COVID-19. About 80% of the persons will have anxiety and tension, which is likely to affect their driving behaviour (e.g., rash driving, distraction, insecurity).","Singh, Vikram, Gupta, Kamini, Agarwal, Amit, Chakrabarty, Neelima","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eastsj.2022.100087","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Transport Studies;JOUR: 100087,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40881,""
"COVID-19-related Health Worries and Generalized Anxiety Symptoms: Higher Risks in Perinatal Women Without a Pre-existing Generalized Anxiety Diagnosis","The perinatal period has been well-established as a time of vulnerability to anxiety, as has the COVID-19 pandemic. Perinatal women with a prior diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) may be anticipated to be at particular risk for elevated symptom burden when facing the overlay of these stressors. This study examined whether pre-existing anxiety exacerbates COVID-19 related health worries on anxiety symptom severity among a sample of women who entered perinatal status during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed COVID-19-related health worries, past diagnosis of GAD, and current generalized anxiety symptoms cross-sectionally in 1,587 perinatal U.S. women during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 21, 2020 to June 24, 2021). Among perinatal women who reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries, those with a pre-existing GAD diagnosis were 3.56 times more likely to score at clinically significant levels of generalized anxiety, while those without a pre-existing GAD diagnosis were 6.51 times more likely. COVID-19-related health worries posed a larger risk for elevated anxiety symptoms among those without a pre-existing diagnosis of GAD. Greater access to treatment and psychoeducation for such individuals may be warranted for individuals without a pre-existing mental health diagnosis.","Liu, Cindy H.; Koire, Amanda, Feldman, Natalie, Erdei, Carmina, Mittal, Leena","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114918","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;JOUR: 114918,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40882,""

"Cyberbullying Victimization as a Predictor of Depressive Symptoms among Selected Adolescents amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic","Victimization via cyberbullying has become a significant mental health concern particularly among adolescents at risk of depression and other mental health issues. As the COVID-19 outbreak forced everyone to stay at home and participate in their educational, recreational, and entertainment activities online, this study investigated the relation between cyberbullying victimization and depressive symptoms among 612 college students in Tamilnadu, India. We hypothesized that experiences of cyberbullying victimization would predict depressive symptoms among the participants. Adolescents aged 18 to 19 from colleges in Tamilnadu completed an online survey composed of the Cybervictimization Questionnaire for Adolescents (CYVIC) and the Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Results showed a significant positive relation between cyberbullying victimization and depression (r = 0.80, p &lt; .001). Regression analysis revealed that cyberbullying victimization is a statistically significant predictor of depressive symptoms (r2 = 0.65). Likewise, impersonation (r = 0.70), written-verbal cyber victimization (r = 0.73), visual teasing/happy slapping (r = 0.69), and online exclusion (r = 0.67) contributed to the significant positive association between the variables. These findings can serve as a foundation for intervention programs to alleviate depressive symptoms by addressing cyberbullying experiences and conducting further research on the negative effects of cyberbullying victimization among adolescents.","Michael, J.

"Entrepreneurial Performance: Determinants of Performance in Stimulus-Oriented Granting","Local governments consistently face challenges of economic depression and the unexpected events that precipitate them, such as COVID-19. The depressions leave governments taxed for resources, infrastructure, and time. These depressions are often helped by large infusions of federal grant dollars, otherwise known as stimulus-oriented granting. Key variables in determining success in spending these stimulus dollars include government structure and different forms of capacity. These are traditionally tested characteristics that governments already possess. What we know less about is how governments take advantage of these spending opportunities without regard to the resources that are under their control. This is referred to as entrepreneurial orientation. Using the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), this study tests the effect of entrepreneurial orientation, form of government, and capacity on local government spending of federal grant dollars, specifically in stimulus-oriented granting. This study has implications for other stimulus-oriented granting, such as the COVID-19-motivated, Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES).","Terman, Jessica N.","https://doi.org/10.1080/15309576.2022.2132520","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Performance & Management Review;JOUR: 1-23,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40886,""
"Innovation, exploration and a whole lot of learning through an online programme of Allied Health Professional development","This account of practice gives an overview and insight into the learning from a co-designed leadership development programme for Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) across two NHS Integrated Care Systems. The AHP community that completed the courses consisted of acute and community trust, mental health, local authority, and SCAS (paramedics) working in the healthcare system across the full range of AHP roles during the Covid-19 pandemic. Working in partnership the programme was co-designed, engaging participants in the design process before and throughout the delivery of the programme. The entire programme was delivered online to a cohort of forty-two AHPs who had volunteered to be participants. The overarching aim of the programme was to support AHPs and promote their career progression through developing confidence and capability in their leadership practice. by meeting the following objectives: (1) developing and enriching understanding, and practice, of systemic leadership;(2) developing Keats' concept of 'negative capability' (Ou 2009) - creativity and action in the midst of uncertainty and ambiguity;(3) strengthening voice, confidence, and influence, as a valued leader in the system. A set of quantitative evaluation criteria were collectively agreed and these were run before and after the programme. Further to this several qualitative questions were asked before the programme to inform its design and post-programme to deepen insight into the process and experience of participants. This was very helpful in learning from the experience and in informing future work of this nature. The programme was designed utilising an innovative delivery method using techniques and approaches that had been developed through the Covid-19 pandemic with face-to-face delivery being unavailable. The aspiration was to work in depth with a medium-sized cohort as a community of learning and leadership practice.","Lindsay, Toby","https://doi.org/10.1080/14767333.2022.2130724","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Action Learning: Research and Practice;JOUR: 1-11,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40887,""

"Family Economics and Mental Health Among High School Students During COVID-19","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented socioeconomic and health impacts in the U.S. This study examined racial/ethnic and school poverty status differences in the relationship between parent job loss, experiences with hunger, and indicators of mental health problems among public high school students nationwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study analyzed data from the Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES), conducted during January-June 2021. ABES was a one-time, cross-sectional, online survey that used a stratified, three-stage cluster sample to obtain a nationally representative sample of high school students in the U.S. This study was limited to public school students (N=7,379). Results Among public high school students nationwide, 36.9% experienced poor mental health during the pandemic, and during the past year, 43.9% experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, 19.8% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 9.1% attempted suicide. Parent job loss and having gone hungry were associated with indicators of mental health problems, overall, and across racial/ethnic groups and school poverty status levels. Conclusions Students who experience parent job loss and hunger are likely to also experience poor mental health and may be at higher risk for suicide.","Jones, Sherry Everett, Hertz, Marci F.; DeGue, Sarah, Merlo, Caitlin, Piepenbrink, Rumour P.; Le, Vi D.; Dittus, Patricia, Houston, Aaron, Thornton, Jemekia, Ethier, Kathleen A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2022.09.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Journal of Preventive Medicine;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40889,""
"Related factors of depressive symptoms vary among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Depression represents a public health problem, especially in the adolescent and young adult populations. Studies have shown that during the COVID-19 outbreak, depressive symptoms were associated with economic instability, among other aspects related to isolation. The present study seeks to identify sociodemographic characteristics and situations associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in young people (N = 2058) in an Andean city at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Logistic regression analysis reveals that the factors predicting depressive symptoms vary between adolescents and young adults. The results show that perceived health status, satisfaction with virtuality, and being a woman are related to depressive symptoms. Likewise, it was found that, in young adults, but not in adolescents, the level of economic income and taking virtual classes were related to symptomatology.

"The â€˜Cost of Living Crisisâ€™ and its effects on health: A qualitative study from the UK (preprint)","OBJECTIVE The study explored the impacts of an economic crisis â€“ the UKâ€™s â€˜cost of living crisisâ€™ â€“ on mental and physical health from the perspectives of people themselves. It also explored how people coping with this crisis, and as a secondary objective, explored if, and if so how, the COVID-19 pandemic was shaping, their experiences or views of the cost of living crisis.DESIGN This qualitative study consisted of online focus groups carried out between September 14th- 29th 2022. Data were analysed using a thematic approach.SETTING Focus groups took place via (Zoom) videoconferencing.PARTICIPANTS Participants (n= 28) were all UK adults, recruited as part of the Public Views during the Covid Pandemic (PVCOVID) study.RESULTS Most participants, and particularly those on low or insecure income or living in deprived communities, felt that the cost of living crisis was having negative impact on their mental and emotional health and wellbeing. Analysis generated five main themes, three related to why the cost of living crisis was affecting their health: (1) Anxiety over an uncertain future;(2) Worry about others;(3) A loss of control and two related to the ways in which people were coping, or trying to cope, with the crisis: (1) Resilience and Family and community support. CONCLUSIONS. This study found that the cost of living crisis is having significant impacts on health, particularly on the mental health of those on low- or insecure-incomes or from deprived communities. Further research and policy investment is needed to explore ways to provide emotional as well as practical/financial support for those most vulnerable to economic crises.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tr4xf","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40892,""
"The Effects of the Unified Protocol and Unified Protocol Skills on Loneliness in the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background: Loneliness is a significant public health concern with no established first-line intervention although modular, transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral interventions, such as the Unified Protocol (UP), are promising candidates. The UP contains skill modules to target anxiety, depression, and related conditions, although it is unclear if the UP can reduce loneliness and if UP skill use contributes to these reductions. Methods: Using data from the first-stage randomization of a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial, we tested whether the UP led to reductions in loneliness and whether specific dimensions of UP skill use predicted session-to-session changes in loneliness. Participants (N = 70;Mage = 33.74, 67% female, 74% white) completed six sessions of core UP modules, reporting how frequently they felt lonely and used UP skills before each session. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we examined the trajectory of change in loneliness and disaggregated between- from within-person variability to test session-to-session effects of skill use. Results: Loneliness significantly decreased during treatment with the UP. Using more UP skills than oneâ€™s personal average, but not frequency of skill use, predicted session-to-session decreases in loneliness. Conclusions: Therapists may be encouraged to guide patients toward using a large quantity of different skills to specifically address loneliness.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/h87em","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40893,""
"Managing Fear During Pandemics: Risks and Opportunities (preprint)","Fear is an emotion triggered by the perception of danger and is a motivator for safety behaviors, including hygienic ones. Within the context of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were ample danger cues (e.g., images of patients on ventilators) and a high need for people to use appropriate safety behaviors (e.g., social distancing). Given this central role of fear within the context of a pandemic, it is important to review some of the emerging findings and lessons learned to manage fear during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, in the current paper, we highlight different factors that determine fear (i.e., proximity, predictability, and controllability), we review several adaptive and maladaptive consequences of fear of COVID-19 (e.g., following governmental health policies and panic buying), and we make recommendations for policies that can promote adequate health behaviors and limit negative consequences of fear during pandemics.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/73jz2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40894,""

This had negative effects on their mental health, ranging from mild to severe. These effects also affected their personal and professional lives. The purpose of this study is to measure the anxiety and depression levels in college students due to COVID-19, along with the significant factors that contribute to that effect. We use the benchmark Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] questionnaire, as the basis of an online survey to capture the anxiety and depression levels amongst college students in various disciplines and at different levels. This survey was circulated through social media networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on. The responses were collected and analysed using Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms for understanding the significant factors leading to the anxiety and depression of college students between ages 20 and 24.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2207225/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40895,""
"Identifying Factors Affecting Depressive Symptoms and Incidence of Mental Health Diagnosis within 1 Year among 2SLGBTQ+ Youth During COVID-19 Using Machine Learning Methods (preprint)","Purpose:  There is a lack of longitudinal studies that examine changes in mental health among 2SLGBTQ+ youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, using a Canadian cohort of young 2SLGBTQ+ (16-29 years old), weidentified the factors that predicted increases in self-reported depressive symptoms scores (n = 882) and those that predicted incidence in diagnosis of mental health problems within 1 year among a subset of the cohort who were never diagnosed with mental health problems at baseline (n = 344) using machine learning techniques. Methods: : Random Forest regression and classifier were used to identify factors associated with the outcomes. Data were split into training and test sets;Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and area under the curve (AUC) were used as the criteria to evaluate model performance on the test set. Results: : The top ten predictors of each outcome were identified, nine of them were the same for both outcomes. These shared nine variables were: self-rated mental health (SRMH), adverse childhood experiences (ACE), depressive symptoms, stressful life, internalized homophobia, outness, community connectedness, enacted stigma, and perceived sexual stigma at baseline. Some predictors had a unique non-linear relationship with the outcomes. Conclusion:  These analyses suggest that 2SLGBTQ+ specific factors (such as outness) and oneâ€™s psychological well-being were the most important factors in predicting oneâ€™s future mental health. Social identities such as gender or sexuality appeared to be less significant in affecting oneâ€™s mental health. More studies with larger samples are needed to better understand some of the complex non-linear associations.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2199889/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40896,""

Methods: : Data were used from 2010 (n=6,641) and 2021 (n=8,863) based on a longitudinal population-based study with the aim to study risk and protective factors for mental health. Self-reported depression was assessed using Major Depression Inventory and in 2021 questions on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic were added. Prevalence was calculated and presented with 95% confidence intervals. Results: : Depression and depressive symptoms had increased in 2021 compared with 2010. The highest prevalence was found in women and in the youngest age-group. There was no difference after adjusting for Covid-19 infection in any of the age-groups. Women who experienced life changes related to the pandemic situation had higher rates of depression as well as those who lost their job during the pandemic. Conclusion:  During the Covid-19 pandemic, it seems both depression and depressive symptoms become more common. However, we did not find support for a direct effect related to a Covid-19 infection but our results suggest that part of the increase may be due to secondary social and economic consequences of the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2190150/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40898,""
"The network structure of psychopathological and resilient responses to the coronavirus pandemic: A multi-country study of general population depression and anxiety symptoms (preprint)","Commonly identified trajectories of psychological distress in response to adverse events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, include Resilience, Delayed distress, Recovery and Sustained distress. The current study aimed to analyse these four distinct response patterns during the pandemic using network analysis. Anxiety and depression symptom data collected across four European countries over the first year of the pandemic were analysed (N = 3594). Participants were firstly categorised into one of the four aforementioned response patterns. Networks of symptoms were then estimated in each of these groups, and they were compared in relation to network connectivity and symptom clustering. Informed by network theory, it was hypothesised that greater levels of resiliency would be characterised by lower symptom connectivity and fewer symptom clusters. Two-thirds (64%) of the sample were categorised as displaying a pattern of Resilience. The connectivity hypothesis was partially supported: the Sustained distress group show higher connectivity than the Recovered group;however, the Resilient group showed higher connectivity than the Delayed distress group. Regarding symptom clustering, non-random clusters were identified in the Recovered and Sustained groups only, and, in contrast to the initial hypotheses, more clusters emerged in the Recovered group (three) than in the Sustained distress group (two). Our results replicated findings that resilience was the most common mental health pattern over the first year of the pandemic. Moreover, they suggested that high network connectivity may be indicative of a stable mental health response over time, whereas fewer symptom clusters may be indicative of a pattern of sustained distress. Although exploratory, the network perspective provided a useful tool to examine the complexity of patterns of psychological responses to adverse events, and if replicated, could be used to help identify indicators of protection against, or vulnerability to, psychological distress in future.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2189648/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40899,""

"Problematic Facebook use, psychological distress and well-being during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal investigation (preprint)","The social isolation and the subsequent, increased use of Social Networking Sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on subjective well-being around the world. The present longitudinal study examined whether changes in psychological distress and well-being during the Italian second wave of the pandemic differ among people with different levels of Problematic Facebook Use (PFU). A total of 493 participants (M age = 24.55Â±7.25;80.3% females) completed measures of passive use of Facebook, social comparison orientation on Facebook, fear of missing out, psychological distress (depressive symptoms and fear of COVID-19 pandemic) and well-being across three waves. Latent class analysis (LCA) categorized participants into three groups with different PFU levels: Healthy users, Moderate PFU users, and High PFU users. Hierarchical Linear Modeling showed that the between-person level (class membership) accounted for most of the variability in psychological distress and well-being. No significant changes were found in psychological distress and well-being over time, but the High PFU users showed greater levels of psychological distress and lower levels of well-being at each time point. The findings of this study suggest that the relationship between PFU, psychological distress and well-being may reflect trait-like time-invariant differences between individuals rather than state-like changes.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2174638/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40901,""
"Long- COVID and General Health Status in Hospitalized COVID-19 Survivors: A Prospective Cohort Study (preprint)","Background:  Despite advances in clinical research, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on patients are not clear. Many studies revealed persistent long-term signs and symptoms after recovery that continue for more than months after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Methods: : In a prospective cohort study,259 hospitalized patients between 18 to 59 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by molecular RT-PCR were interviewed. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and complaints were studied by telephone interviews. Any patient-reported symptoms that continued or developed from 4 weeks up to 12 weeks after the onset of the COVID-19 were recorded only if they did not exist prior to infection. The 12-Item General Health Questionnaire was used for screening and assessing mental symptoms and psychosocial well-being. Analyses were done using Excel and STATA SE software v13.1. Results: : The mean age of participants was 43.8 Â± 9.9 years, the mean length of hospital stay was 4.4 Â± 4 days, and 58.3% were women. About 37% had at least one underlying disease, The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus in 38.1%, hypertension in 32%, and hypothyroidism in 13.4%. 92.5 % showed ongoing symptoms that the most prevalent complications were hair loss (61.4%), fatigue (54.1%), shortness of breath (40.2%), altered smell (34.4%), aggression (34.4%), memory impairment (29 %), and depression (25.1%), respectively.

This study aimed to explore the predictors of depressive symptoms among Hong Kong people during the epidemic, as well as factors that could potentially alleviate the negative effects of the epidemic. Methods: : A longitudinal prospective survey study was conducted with the general population aged 18 and above in Hong Kong. The third wave follow-up survey (December 2021 to January 2022) was used for a cross-sectional analysis (n= 803). Logistic and linear regression were performed to test the predictors and moderating effects respectively. Results: : With minimized confounding effects of demographic variables, higher levels of concern of infection, experience with COVID-19 infection and previous epidemics, hassles, and trust in authority increased the odds of being depressive, while a higher level of trust in medical professionals reduced the odds of depression. Moreover, greater trust in medical professionals, as a moderator, lessened the positive associations between the levels of depression and hassles, concern about infection. Conclusions: : Even though the threats of COVID-19 seem to have lowered, this study shows that a few factors associated with the pandemic continue to threaten peopleâ€™s mental health.

"Molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with three essential partners: exploring possible immune escape mechanisms of viarl mutants (preprint)","The COVID-19 epidemic is raging around the world, including the emergence of viral mutant strains such as Delta and Omicron, posing severe challenges to people's health and quality of life. Full understanding life cycle of the virus in host cells helps to reveal inactivation mechanism of antibody and provide inspiration for the development of a new-generation vaccines. In this work, molecular recognitions and conformational changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) mutants (i.e., Delta, Mu and Omicron) and three essential partners (i.e., membrane receptor hACE2, protease TMPRSS2 and antibody C121) both were compared and analyzed using molecular simulations. Water basin and binding free energy calculations both show that the three mutants possess higher affinity for hACE2 than WT, exhibiting stronger virus transmission. The descending order of cleavage ability by TMPRSS2 is Mu, Delta, Omicron and WT, which is related to the new S1/S2 cutting site induced by transposition effect. The inefficient utilization of TMPRSS2 by Omicron is consistent with its primary entry into cells via the endosomal pathway. In addition, RBD-directed antibody C121 showed obvious resistance to Omicron, which may have originated from high fluctuation of approaching angles, high flexibility of I472-F490 loop and reduced binding ability. According to the overall characteristics of the three mutants, high infectivity, high immune escape and low virulence may be the future evolutionary selection of SARS-CoV-2. In a word, this work not only proposes the possible resistance mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, but also provides theoretical guidance for the subsequent drug design against COVID-19 based on SP structure.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2151226/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40905,""
"The moderating role of body image and BMI in the relationship between physical activity and internalizing problems during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Internalizing problems is a worldwide burden that is not being abated with our current knowledge and treatment of the condition. Numerous clinical trials have supported that physical activity (PA) can reduce the internalizing problems in adolescents , but little is known about its mechanism of action. Therefore, the study objectives were to explore the potential relationship between physical activity (PA) and internalizing problems (depression and anxiety) from the perspective of body image and body mass index (BMI), and to provide an important reference for future self-esteem education and health promotion intervention. Methods: : The participants in this study were 251 Chinese college students between 17 and 22 years old. Participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), the Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ), the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). A descriptive and correlational approach was used, using the PROCESS macro for Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: : (1) Physical activity was significantly negatively correlated with both dimensions of internalizing problems (t = -0.237, p &lt; 0.001;t = -0.193, p &lt; 0.01). (2) Body image had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between physical activity and anxiety among college students, but there was no moderating effect between depression and physical activity.

This study aimed to determine the association between sleep quality and psychological distress in COVID-19 carriers in China and evaluate the moderating effects of perceived social support. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1283 asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers from Ruijin Jiahe Fangcang shelter hospitals in Shanghai, China. Participants had an average age of 39.64 years ( SD  = 11.14) and 59.6% of whom were male. They were assessed using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) respectively. The Model Templates for PROCESS were used to examine the moderating effects of participantsâ€™ social support on the association. Results In total, 34.3% of participants presented with poor sleep quality (PSQI<U+0F1E>5);In addition, 41.1% patients showed bad mental health (GHQ<U+0F1E>3). Sleep quality was positively related to mental health ( r  = 0.30, p  &lt; 0.001) and social support ( r  = 0.08, p  = 0.003). Social support was negatively related to mental health ( r = -0.43, p  &lt; 0.001). Social support negatively moderated the association between sleep quality and mental health ( ÃŸ =  0.069, p  &lt; 0.01). Conclusions Social support may be beneficial to the improvement of mental health, especially for people in crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2058726/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40908,""
"Beyond Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle â€“ Staff perceptions on facilitators and barriers to implementation of telepresence robots in long-term care (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19â€™s physical distancing mandates have increased the likelihood of experiencing social isolation and loneliness for residents in long-term care, especially those living with dementia. Social isolation correlates with health risks, including depression and cognitive decline. Telepresence robots can be remotely driven and facilitate social interaction through videoconferencing. Researchers have begun to explore opportunities for using these robots in the healthcare field. However, the perspectives of key stakeholders have not been fully explored. This qualitative descriptive study focuses on exploring staff and leadership teamsâ€™ perspectives on facilitators and barriers to implementing telepresence robots in long-term care. Methods: : We employed purposive and snowballing methods to recruit 22 participants from two LTC in British Columbia, Canada: operational and unit leaders, and interdisciplinary staff including nursing staff, care aides, and allied health practitioners. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided data collection and analysis. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted through in-person and virtual meetings. Thematic analysis was employed to generate insights into participantsâ€™ perspectives. Results: : Our analysis identified three themes: (a) â€˜The robots are now more urgently needed.â€™ - the essential needs for family-resident connections, (b) â€˜Listen to the voice of frontline staffâ€™ - meaningful engagement builds partnership, and (c) â€˜I need to practice and practiceâ€™ - training and timely support gives confidence. Based on the findings and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guidance, we offer an easy-to-use tool â€˜ START â€™ to encourage the practical application of evidence-based strategies in technology implementation: S hare benefits and successes;T ailor planning with staff partners;A cknowledge staff concerns;R epeat training;and T imely technical support. Conclusions: : Our study offers pragmatic insights into the complexity of implementing telepresence robots in LTC. Healthcare leaders should consider evidence-based strategies in implementing innovations beyond the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1971954/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40909,""
"Using the flexible analytic hierarchy process method to solve the emergency decision making of public health for COVID-19 (preprint)","The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was initially found in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread throughout the world, causing the collapse of medical systems and economic depression. In addition to providing various relief programs, many countries have implemented various anti-epidemic measures to stop the continuous deterioration of the epidemic and maintain the stability of their economies. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency decision making and risk assessment is an important issue for guaranteeing the stable life of the people are considered emergency multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The assessment information of the criteria simultaneously includes complete, incomplete and hesitant fuzzy linguistic information in emergency MCDM problems. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach can effectively process MCDM problems;however, the traditional AHP approach cannot handle the incomplete and hesitant fuzzy linguistic information of emergency MCDM problems. In order to overcome these issues, this paper proposed a novel flexible AHP method to solve emergency MCDM problems under the COVID-19 pandemic, and adopted a numerical case about public health emergency decision making and risk assessment under the COVID-19 pandemic to verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed flexible AHP method.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1306380/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40910,""
"Prevalence and Predictors of Anxiety Among Stable Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients in Malaysia (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic creates anxiety among hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 patients. Therefore, this study aims to determine the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors among stable inpatient COVID-19 patients in Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based online survey involving 401 patients from Malaysia's leading COVID-19 hospitals from 15th April until 30th June 2020 who were chosen using quota sampling. General Anxiety Disorders 7 items (GAD-7), Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief-COPE) and Socio-demographic profile questionnaire were used. Descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression were performed using SPSS v23 to determine the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors. The results showed that prevalence of anxiety was 7.0%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that female (p &lt;0.05), fear of infection (p &lt;0.05), lack of information (p &lt;0.05), maladaptive coping mechanism of behavioural disengagement (p &lt;0.001) and self-blame (p &lt;0.001) were significantly associated with anxiety. Whereas adaptive coping mechanisms via instrumental support (p &lt;0.001) was a significant protective predictor of anxiety. COVID-19 infection has had a significant influence on the mental health of patients. Findings in our study provides baseline findings on prevalence of anxiety among stabilized COVID-19 inpatient in Malaysia.

"Impact of a pulmonary rehabilitation program on social disadvantage and physical activity data of postCOVID19 patients: A North-African pilot study (preprint)","Background:  In addition to the cardiorespiratory, muscular, and neurological manifestations, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) alters patientsâ€™ health-related quality of life (HRQoL), induces a large variety of psychiatric manifestations, and reduces mobility and motor activity. Several studies have raised the impact of a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) on social disadvantage ( e.g., HRQoL, anxiety, depression) and physical activity of COVID-19 patients, but very few have been performed in low-income countries. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a PRP on post-COVID-19 HRQoL, hospital anxiety and depression (HAD), and physical activity in Tunisian post-COVID19-patients. Methods:  This was a cross-sectional study in an outpatient care setting. Patients with post-COVID-19 were included. They completed an interview (including three questionnaires) before and after a PRP (three sessions/week for four weeks, each session was 70 minutes in duration, PRP items: aerobic cycle endurance, strength training, and education). The VQ11 questionnaire assessed functional dimension, psychological dimension, relational dimension, and total score;HAD appraised depression and anxiety;and Voorrips physical activity assessed daily activity, physical activity, leisure activity, and total scores. Data were expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation in PRP change (PRP change=after-PRP values - before-PRP values). Results:  In total, 14 moderate to severe post-COVID-19 patients (61Â±4 years) were included. The PRP significantly improved the i) functional, psychological, and relational dimensions, and the VQ11 total score by 1.79Â±1.58 (p=0.0033), 2.00Â±2.15 (p=0.0108), 1.57Â±1.50 (p=0.0077), and 5.36Â±3.97 (p=0.0015), respectively;ii) HAD anxiety and depression scores by 2.07Â±2.40 (p=0.0076), and 2.57Â±3.08 (p=0.0058);and iii) physical activity and total scores by 1.75Â±2.44 (p=0.0251), and 1.78Â±2.65 (p=0.0341), respectively.

"Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, psychological issues, college adjustment, and digital skills (preprint)","Background:  The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: : In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 Â± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32;RMSE: 2.42;R 2 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59;RMSE: 2.49;R 2 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety;while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion:  Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.76127.3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40913,""
"Older Adultsâ€™ Attitudes Regarding COVID-19 and Associated Infection Control Measures in Shanghai, and Impact on Well-Being (preprint)","This cross-sectional study investigated health management, well-being, and pandemic-related perspectives in Shanghainese adults =50 years during early and strict COVID-19 control measures. A self-report survey was administered via Wenjuanxing between March-April/2020. Items from the Somatic Symptom Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 were administered, as well as pandemic-specific questions. 1181 primarily married, retired females participated;Many had hypertension (n=521, 44.1%), coronary artery disease (CAD;n=201, 17.8%) and diabetes (n=171, 14.5%). While most respondents (n=868;73.5%) were strictly following control measures (including limiting visits with children;n=390, 33.0%) and perceived they could tolerate that beyond 6 months (n=555;47.0%), they were optimistic about the future if control measures were continued (n=969;82.0%), and perceived impact would be temporary (n=646;64.7%). 52 of those with any condition (8.2%) and 19 of those without a condition (3.5%) reported the pandemic was impacting their health. Somatic symptoms were high (29.4Â±7.1/36), with Sleep & Cognitive symptoms highest. 24.4% and 18.9% of respondents had elevated depressive and anxious symptoms, respectively;greater distress was associated with lower income (p=0.018), having hypertension (p=0.001) and CAD (p&lt;0.001), more negative perceptions of global COVID-19 control (p=0.004), COVID-19 spread (p=0.001), impact on life and health (p&lt;0.001), compliance with control measures (p&lt;0.001), and shorter time control measures could be tolerated (p&lt;0.001) in adjusted analyses.

"The Antidepressant Advisor (ADeSS): A Decision Support System for Antidepressant Treatment for Depression in UK primary care â€“ a feasibility study (preprint)","Objectives To develop and probe the first computerised decision-support tool to provide antidepressant treatment guidance to GPs in UK primary care. Design A parallel group, cluster-randomised controlled feasibility trial, where individual participants were blind to treatment allocation. Setting South London NHS GP practices. Participants Ten practices and eighteen patients with treatment-resistant current major depressive disorder (MDD). Interventions Practices were randomised to two treatment arms: 1) treatment-as-usual, 2) computerised decision support tool. Results Ten GP practices participated in the trial, which was within our target range (8-20). However, practice and patient recruitment were slower than anticipated and only 18 of 86 intended patients were recruited. This was due to fewer than expected patients being eligible for the study, as well as disruption resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. Only one patient was lost to follow-up. There were no serious or medically important adverse events during the trial. GPs in the â€˜Decision toolâ€™ arm indicated moderate support for the tool. A minority of patients fully engaged with the mobile app-based tracking of symptoms, medication adherence and side effects. Conclusions Overall, the trial is not feasible in the current form and would need to be modified as follows to overcome its limitations: 1) inclusion of patients who have only tried one SSRI, rather than two, to improve recruitment and pragmatic relevance of the study, 2) approaching community pharmacists to implement tool recommendations rather than GPs, 3) further funding to directly interface between the decision support tool and self-reported symptom app, 4) increasing the geographic reach by not requiring detailed diagnostic assessments and replacing this with supported remote self-report.

"What is the current state of public health system preparedness for infectious disease emergencies? A scoping review (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to demonstrate the risks and profound health impacts that result from infectious disease emergencies. Emergency preparedness has been defined as the knowledge, capacity and organizational systems that governments, response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals develop to anticipate, respond to, or recover from emergencies. This scoping review explored recent literature on priority areas and indicators for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) with a focus on infectious disease emergencies. Methods: Using scoping review methodology, a comprehensive search was conducted for indexed and grey literature with a focus on records published from 2017 and 2020 onward, respectively. Records were included if they: a) described PHEP, b) focused on an infectious emergency, and c) were published in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country. An evidence-based all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP consisting of 11 elements was used as a reference point to identify additional areas of preparedness that have emerged in recent publications. The findings were summarized thematically. Results: The included publications largely aligned with the all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP. In particular, the elements related to collaborative networks, community engagement, risk analysis and communication were frequently observed across the publications included in this review. Emergent themes were identified that expand on the Resilience Framework for PHEP. These were related to mitigating inequities, public health capacities (vaccination, laboratory system capacity, infection prevention and control capacity, financial investment in infrastructure, public health legislation, phases of preparedness), scientific capacities (research and evidence-informed decision making, climate and environmental health), and considerations for health system capacity. Conclusions: The themes from this review contribute to the evolving understanding of critical public health preparedness actions;however, there was a paucity of recent evidence on PHEP indicators. The themes can expand on the 11 elements outlined in the Resilience Framework for PHEP, specifically relevant to infectious disease emergencies and risks. Further research will be important to validate these findings, and expand understanding of how refinements to PHEP frameworks and indicators can support public health practice.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.25.22281308","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40916,""
"The COVID-19 burnout scale: Development and initial validation (preprint)","We developed and validated a self-assessment instrument to measure COVID-19 pandemic-related burnout in the general population. We assessed the psychometric properties of the COVID-19 burnout scale (COVID-19-BS). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis identified three factors for the COVID-19-BS;emotional exhaustion, physical exhaustion, and exhaustion due to measures against the COVID-19. Cronbachâ€™ s alpha coefficients for the three factors and the COVID-19-BS ranged from 0.860 to 0.921. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.945 and p-value for Bartlett test was &lt;0.001 indicating highly acceptable values. Convergent validity results indicated a significant positive correlation between COVID-19-BS and anxiety and depression. Known-groups analysis identified the ability of COVID-19-BS to discriminate groups according to gender, chronic condition, and health status. Our findings indicate that the final 13-item model of COVID-19-BS is a brief, easy to administer, valid and reliable scale for assessing COVID-19-related burnout in the general public.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.20.22281317","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40917,""
"Impact of COVID-19 related social isolation on behavioral outcomes in young adults (preprint)","Social isolation strongly affects our emotions, behavior and interactions. Worldwide, individuals experienced prolonged periods of isolation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when authorities imposed restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of social isolation on emotional and behavioral outcomes in young adults from Lombardy, Italy, a global hotspot of COVID-19. We leverage baseline (pre-social isolation) and follow-up (mid-or post isolation) data collected from young adults enrolled in the ongoing, longitudinal Public Health Impact of Metals Exposure (PHIME) study. At baseline, 167 participants completed the ASEBA questionnaires (ASR/YSR) by weblink or in person;65 completed the ASR between 12-18 weeks after the onset of restrictions. Using the sign test and multiple linear regression models, we examined differences in ASR scores between baseline and follow-up adjusting for sex, age, pre-pandemic IQ (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Tests;K-BIT 2), and time with social restrictions (weeks). Further, we examined interactions between sex and time in social isolation. Participants completed the ASR after spending an average of 14 weeks in social isolation (range 12-18 weeks). Thought Problems increased between baseline and follow-up (median difference 1.0;1 st. , 3 rd quartile: -1.0, 4.0;p=0.049). Among males, a longer time with social isolation (= 14 weeks) was associated with increased rule-breaking behaviors of 2.8 points. These results suggest the social isolation related to COVID-19 adversely impacted mental health. In particular, males seem to externalize their condition. These findings might help future interventions and treatment to minimize the consequences of social isolation experience in young adults.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.20.22280791","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40918,""
"Spanish Version of the Attitude Towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale: Reliability and Validity Assessment (preprint)","Background:  and purpose: The negative attitude to vaccines for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has motivated the adaptation of instruments for this specific purpose. However, details of the reliability and validity of these scales are unknown. The study aimed to evaluate some indicators of the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale. Methods: A validation study was carried out with 1,136 students of emerging age (18 and 29 years) from a Colombian university;65.5% were female. Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were calculated for reliability, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyzes for validity. Additionally, the gender differential item functioning (DIF) was estimated with Kendall's tau b. Results: The Spanish version of Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.94 and McDonald's omega of 0.95), a one-dimensional structure with acceptable goodness-of-fit indicators (CFI=0.94, TLI=0.91, and SRMR=0.04), and non-gender DIF (Kendall's tau b between 0.02 and 0.06).

"The Debate on Protecting Intellectual Property Rights for COVID-19 Vaccines & Therapeutics (preprint)","COVID-19 is proving a durable obstacle to global public health and to the worldâ€™s economies. And while the battle against COVID has largely been waged in laboratories and clean rooms of pharmaceutical giants seated in the worldâ€™s largest economies, the populations most in need do not have anywhere near proportional access to the fruits of those laboratory victories. The cutting-edge vaccines and therapeutics that are permanently changing the public health landscape are carefully guarded intellectual property in which major states, multilateral organizations, and the global pharmaceutical industry all have interest and stakes. Since Fall 2020, an outspoken movement has emerged that seeks a waiver of international intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics through the World Trade Organizationâ€™s TRIPS Council, the governing body for transnational IP issues. Because TRIPS typically operates through unanimity, the waiver movementâ€”launched by India and South Africa but now championed by the United Statesâ€”faces a substantial hurdle: strenuous opposition from trade groups and some E.U. member states (most critically Germany.) This Note examines the IP landscape for COVID-19 intellectual property vis-Ã -vis the TRIPS Agreement;surveys the major policy and legal arguments on both sides of the TRIPS waiver debate;and looks at major precedent for one non-TRIPS solution to the IP waiver debate: public-private partnerships. The Note concludes that while it is possible to reach a workable solution through TRIPS, the WTO process has proven a poor fit for pandemic crises because of the baked-in consensus requirement and the generally ponderous pace of diplomacy. Instead, the Note posits that in the short-term, events on the ground may have overtaken the diplomatic process;and long-term, the goal should not be free-flowing pharmaceutical IP but investment in distributed vaccine production capacity and new supply chain development across the Global South.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Debate+on+Protecting+Intellectual+Property+Rights+for+COVID-19+Vaccines+&+Therapeutics+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40920,""
"Emotional Issues, Self-Harm Behaviors and Their Impact on Chinese Adolescents During the COVID19 Pandemic: A Structural Equation Model for Seeking and Receiving Psychological Assistance (preprint)","Introduction: COVID19 has produced a global epidemic with long periods of containment, and changes in the home and school environment have exacerbated adolescents' emotional problems and self-injurious behavior, as well as influenced them to seek help from professional psychological assistance. Our study explored the relationship between the home school environment, emotional problems, self-injurious behavior and the propensity to seek help, and developed an emotional-self-injurious-help model. Methods: Fifteen thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven volunteers were recruited from middle and high school cohorts in three Chinese provinces who completed questionnaires on depression, anxiety, self-injury, family dynamics, school bullying and aggression, analysed the findings and developed a structural equation model. Results: During COVID19, both family and school environments influenced adolescents' emotional problems and increased the propensity to seek help;however, self-injurious behavior mediated by self-injury motivation could reduce the chances of adolescents with a desire to seek professional psychological assistance actually receiving it. Conclusions: This study may supply information on the correlation between home school environment, emotional problems, self-injurious behavior and the propensity to seek help among adolescents during COVID19.

"Heterogeneous interventional indirect effects with multiple mediators: non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches (preprint)","We propose semi- and non-parametric methods to estimate conditional interventional indirect effects in the setting of two discrete mediators whose causal ordering is unknown. Average interventional indirect effects have been shown to decompose an average treatment effect into a direct effect and interventional indirect effects that quantify effects of hypothetical interventions on mediator distributions. Yet these effects may be heterogeneous across the covariate distribution. We therefore consider the problem of estimating these effects at particular points. We first propose an influence-function based estimator of the projection of the conditional effects onto a working model, and show that under some conditions we can achieve root-n consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of this parameter. Second, we propose a fully non-parametric approach to estimation and show the conditions where this approach can achieve oracle rates of convergence. Finally, we propose a sensitivity analysis for the conditional effects in the presence of mediator-outcome confounding given a bounded outcome. We propose estimating bounds on the conditional effects using these same methods, and show that these results easily extend to allow for influence-function based estimates of the bounds on the average effects. We conclude by demonstrating our methods to examine heterogeneous mediated effects with respect to the effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on depression via social isolation and worries about health during February 2021.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Heterogeneous+interventional+indirect+effects+with+multiple+mediators:+non-parametric+and+semi-parametric+approaches+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40922,""
"Development of a Data-Driven Digital Phenotype Profile of Distress Experience of Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Due to the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers have reported acting in ways that are contrary to their moral values, which may result in moral distress and injury. The purpose of this work is to create a digital phenotype profile (DPP) tool to automate and evaluate the distress of participants in the COVID-19 VR Healthcare Simulation for Moral Distress dataset (NCT05001542). The dataset collected passive physiological signals and active mental health questionnaires. This paper focuses on correlating electrocardiogram, respiration, photoplethysmography and galvanic skin response with moral injury outcome scale (Brief MIOS). The DPP tool uses data-driven techniques to create a robust evaluation of distress among participants. To accomplish this, we applied pre-processing techniques which involved normalization, data sanitation, segmentation, and windowing. During feature analysis, we extracted statistical and heart rate variability features, followed by feature selection techniques to rank the importance of features. Prior to classification, we used k-means clustering to cluster the Brief MIOS scores to low, moderate, and high moral distress as the Brief MIOS is yet to have an established cut-off scores. We then classified the separation of the Brief MIOS scores using weighted support vector machine with leave-one-subject-out-cross-validation to achieve an accuracy of 98.67Â±0.87%. Various machine learning ablation tests were performed to support our results and further enhance the understanding of the predictive model. Our findings suggest that the proposed DPP tool could be used as an automated tool to examine moral distress. With further replication and validation, it could be used as a potential AI-based clinical decision-making tool to expedite and validate mental health treatments.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Development+of+a+Data-Driven+Digital+Phenotype+Profile+of+Distress+Experience+of+Healthcare+Workers+During+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40923,""
"Income Insecurity and Mental Health in Pandemic Times (preprint)","This paper provides novel evidence of the mental health effects of the Covid-19 outbreak. Between April 2020 and April 2022, we run four waves of a large representative survey in Spain, which we benchmark against a decade of pre-pandemic data. We document a large and sudden deterioration of mental health at the beginning of the pandemic, as the share of people reporting being depressed increased from 16\% before the pandemic to 46% in April 2020. This effect is persistent over time, which translates into important and irreversible consequences, such as a surge in suicides. The effect is more pronounced for women, younger individuals and those with unstable incomes. Finally, using mediation analysis, event studies and machine learning techniques, we document the role of the labor market as an important driver of these effects, as women and the young are more exposed to unstable income sources.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Income+Insecurity+and+Mental+Health+in+Pandemic+Times+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40924,""
"The Problem Management Plus psychosocial intervention for distressed and functionally impaired asylum seekers and refugees: the PROSPER feasibility RCT (preprint)","BackgroundThe prevalence of psychological morbidity among asylum seekers and refugees is high, but these groups encounter extensive barriers to accessing health and social care. The aim of the PROSPER study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial in the UK of Problem Management Plus (PM+), an evidence-based psychosocial intervention delivered by lay therapists for distressed and functionally impaired asylum seekers and refugees.DesignWe undertook a feasibility study of PM+, which included a pilot study of the design features of a future definitive randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation. The feasibility study involved the adaptation of PM+ based on evidence drawn from literature synthesis and local stakeholder engagement, and a two-stage training procedure for lay therapists. These were followed by a pilot trial designed to assess the feasibility of conducting a three-arm randomised controlled trial of five 90-minute sessions of PM+, delivered individually or in groups, with 105 participants randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to individual PM+, group PM+ or a control intervention. Primary health outcomes were anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3 months;other outcomes included post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, quality of life, progress with identified goals and service use.FindingsWe demonstrated that the form and content of PM+ could be adapted to meet the needs of asylum seekers and refugees. Twelve people with lived experience of the asylum process were successfully trained as lay therapists to deliver this targeted, low-intensity psychosocial intervention in local asylum seeker and refugee communities. The pilot trial was affected by governance issues. It began in December 2019 and was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were not able to complete recruitment and follow-up as planned;11 out of 105 (10%) participants were recruited to the pilot trial (individual PM+, n = 4;group PM+, n = 3;control, n = 4);8 out of 11 participants were followed up at 13 weeks and 7 out of 11 participants were followed up at 26 weeks. (Preliminary data were gathered on recruitment and retention, intervention fidelity and acceptability of study measures, including service use measures.)LimitationsProtracted delays due to governance issues, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, meant that we were unable to complete the pilot trial or to provide evidence regarding the feasibility of group PM+. The complexities of working with multiple languages and cultural groups were noted. There were mixed views on how successful PM+ might prove, and we had insufficient evidence to provide clear conclusions.Future workFuture research could explore how technology can be used to improve the acceptability, feasibility, efficacy and potential cost-effectiveness of scalable mental health interventions and well-being support for distressed asylum seekers and refugees. The use of mobile phone and/or app-based forms of support may help to increase asylum seekersâ€™ and refugeesâ€™ willingness to engage in research of this type.ConclusionsAlthough it was not possible to specify the parameters for a full randomised controlled trial of PM+ for asylum seekers and refugees in the UK, our findings offer guidance on strategies that may be of value in future studies of this nature.Trial registrationThis trial is registered as ISRCTN15214107.FundingThis project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Public Health Research programme and will be published in full in Public Health Research;Vol. 10, No. 10.

"Experimental Jurisprudence of Health and Disability Law (preprint)","Health law is in its heyday. The COVID-19 pandemic has made health law and disability law prominent in every area of life, including the law school classrooms and faculty meetings. Discussions of vaccine policies, remote teaching, masking as reasonable disability accommodations, rationing of scarce medical equipment, FDA authorization of new treatments, and public health regulation across federal, state, and local levels of governance, dominated many of the [Zoom] conversations in law schools during the last few years. Health law and disability law were therefore upgraded to the status of popular law school classes as well as to more mainstream legal scholarsâ€™ research agendas. Experimental jurisprudence scholarship that uses controlled experiments to address jurisprudential questions and investigate legal concepts, language, and intuitions as lay people perceive them, has gained momentum in recent years. As I will show, the use of experiments in this tradition has slowly penetrated the study of health law and disability law. Yet while the use of experiments to study policy and legal issues related to health and disability is off to a promising start, the potential of this approach remains far from being realized. In this essay, I will first show how the use of experiments has helped revisit core concepts in the fields of health law and disability law. I then review three strands of work that emerged in the existing literature on â€œexperimental health and disability lawâ€: the study of framing â€“ the language of public health messaging;measuring perceived deservingness of government benefits;and testing efficacy of physiciansâ€™ conflict of interest disclosures. I conclude by pointing to new directions scholars should explore in future work.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Experimental+Jurisprudence+of+Health+and+Disability+Law+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40926,""
"â€œThe Usual Challenges of Work are All Magnifiedâ€: Â Australian Paediatric Health Professionalsâ€™ Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased stress and strain on health professionals. With a focus on paediatric cardiac care, this study explored health professionalsâ€™ concerns about COVID-19, perceptions of the impact of pandemic on healthcare, and experiences of psychological stress. Methods: Paediatric health professionals working at a large quaternary hospital in Australia were invited to complete a survey between June 2020 and February 2021. Demographic factors, clinical role characteristics, and anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed. Qualitative data on experiences and perceived effects of the pandemic on paediatric cardiac care were also collected. Results: 228 health professionals (152 nurses, 37 medical doctors, 22 allied and mental health professionals, 17 medical research and administrative staff) participated in the survey (54.4% response rate, 85% women). Half the sample (52.2%) endorsed â€˜moderateâ€™ to â€˜extremeâ€™ worry about COVID-19 and 38% of participants perceived healthcare services as adversely impacted by the pandemic to a â€˜greatâ€™ or â€˜very greatâ€™ extent. Almost one in five health professionals reported anxiety (18%) and 11% reported depressive symptoms indicative of a need for clinical intervention. Six themes were identified in the qualitative data: (1) Concern about the consequences of visitor restrictions and disrupted patient services, (2) Intensified strain on healthcare workers, (3) Feelings of fear and loss, (4) Social isolation and disconnection, (5) Adapting to change, and (6) Gratitude. Conclusion: Timely, tailored policies, supports, and interventions are needed to address health professionalsâ€™ mental health needs during and beyond the pandemic, to minimize the far-reaching impact of situational stressors.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€œThe+Usual+Challenges+of+Work+are+All+Magnifiedâ€:+Â Australian+Paediatric+Health+Professionalsâ€™+Experiences+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN;","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40927,""
"Fear and Trembling While Working in a Pandemic: An Exploratory Meta-Analysis of Workersâ€™ COVID-19 Distress","The global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of workers and taken its toll on health and well-being. In line with recent calls for more inductive and abductive occupational health science research, we exploratorily meta-analyzed workersâ€™ COVID-19 distress, defined as psychological and psychosomatic strain contextualized to experiencing the virus and pandemic broadly. We identified many existing COVID-19 distress measures (e.g., Fear of COVID-19 Scale by Ahorsu et al., 2020; Coronavirus Anxiety Scale by Lee, 2020a) and correlates, including demographic variables (viz., gender, marital status, whether worker has children), positive well-being (e.g., quality of life, perceived social support, resilience), negative well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression, sleep problems), and work-related variables (e.g., job satisfaction, burnout, task performance). Additionally, we found preliminary evidence of subgroup differences by COVID-19 distress measure and country-level moderation moderators (viz., cultural values, pandemic-related government response) as well as COVID-19 distressâ€™s incremental validity over and above anxiety and depression. The findingsâ€”based on k = 135 independent samples totaling N = 61,470 workersâ€”were abductively contextualized with existing theories and previous research. We also call for future research to address the grand challenge of working during the COVID-19 pandemic and ultimately develop a cumulative occupational health psychology of pandemics.","William P.

"Use of substances to cope predicts PTSD symptom persistence: Investigating patterns of interactions between complex PTSD symptoms and its maintaining mechanisms","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a novel related condition, complex PTSD, remain a growing public health challenge across the globe and are associated with negative and persistent long-term consequences. The last decades of research revealed different processes and mechanisms associated with the development and persistence of PTSD and complex PTSD symptoms, including different maladaptive coping strategies, cognitive and experiential avoidance, positive, and negative metacognitions. Despite these advances, little is known about how these different processes interact with specific (C)PTSD symptoms, and how they influence each other over time at the within-person level. Leveraging a large (N > 1,800) longitudinal dataset representative of the Norwegian population during the COVID-19 pandemic, this pre-registered study investigated these symptom-process interactions over an eight-month period. Our panel graphical vector autoregressive (GVAR) network model revealed the dominating role of substance use to cope in predicting higher levels of all different PTSD symptoms over time and being associated with increases in CPTSD symptomatology within more proximal time-windows (i.e., within six weeks). Threat monitoring was associated with increased suicidal ideation, while threat monitoring itself was increasing upon decreased avoidance behavior, greater presence of negative metacognitions, and higher use of substances to cope. In addition, our analyses revealed several, particularly strongly co-occurring PTSD symptoms and processes within the same time window (six weeks, contemporaneous associations). Our findings speak to the importance of attending to different coping strategies, particularly the use of substances as a coping behavior in efforts to prevent PTSD chronicity upon symptom onset. We outline future directions for research efforts to better understand the complex interactions and temporal pathways leading up to the development and maintenance of (C)PTSD symptomatology.","RenÃ© Freichel et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01CD-A2D-B2A","20221110","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","",40929,""
