"Mental health of pregnant women during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France: evolution of self-perceived psychological state during the first lockdown, and anxiety frequency two months after the lockdown ended","Previous pandemics and related lockdowns have had a deleterious impact on pregnant womens mental health. We studied the impact of the SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 pandemic and Frances first lockdown on pregnant womens mental health. A cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2020 using a web-questionnaire completed by 500 adult women who were pregnant during the first lockdown in France (March-May 2020). Questions focused on their self-perceived psychological state and affects they felt before and during the lockdown and anxiety symptomatology (HAD) two months after it ended. A robust variance Poisson regression model was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for anxiety and self-perceived psychological state evolution. One in five respondents (21.1%) reported psychological deterioration during lockdown. Associated determinants were: i) little or no social support (self-perceived) (aRP=1.77, 95%CI[1.18-2.66]), ii) increased workload (1.65, [1.02-2.66]), and iii) poor/moderate knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission (1.60, [1.09-2.35]). Seven percent of women reporting psychological deterioration had access to professional psychological support during lockdown, while 19% did not despite wanting it. Women reported heightened powerlessness (60.3%), frustration (64%) and fear (59.2%) during lockdown. One in seven respondents (14.2%, 95%CI[10.9-18.2]) had anxiety symptoms. Determinants associated: i) at least one pregnancy-related pathology (aPR=1.82, 95%CI[1.15-2.88]), ii) overweightness or obesity (1.61, [1.07-2.43]), iii) one child under the age of six years in the household during the lockdown (3.26, [1.24-8.53]), iv) little or no social support (self-perceived) during the lockdown (1.66, [1.07-2.58]), v) friend or relatives diagnosed with Covid-19 or with symptoms of the disease (1.66; [1.06-2.60]), vi) no access to medication for psychological distress (2.86, [1.74-4.71]), and vii) unsuccessfully seeking exchanges with healthcare professionals about their pregnancy during the pandemic (1.66, [1.08-2.55]). Our results can guide prevention and support policies for pregnant women during pandemics, current or future, with or without lockdowns. Preventing perinatal mental health problems is essential to ensure a supportive environment for the child's development.","Alexandra Doncarli; Lucia Araujo-Chaveron; Catherine Crenn-Hebert; Marie-NoÃ«lle Vacheron; Christophe LÃ©on; Imane Khireddine; Francis Chin; Alexandra Benachi; Sarah Tebeka; Nolwenn Regnault","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.14.22277634","20220715","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34336,""
"Divergent shifts in fear of terrorism","In this study, we examine how the two facets of the fear of terrorismâ€”the affective and behavioural fearsâ€”shift over time. To this end, we use a unique longitudinal data set of a representative sample of 755 Dutch respondents, recruited from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel, in the time period between November 2017 and May 2020. We find that the reported affective fear of terrorism is significantly lower during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 than it was in 2017. Yet a divergent trend for behavioural fear of terrorism occurred. In spite of decreased affective fear of terrorism threats, respondents in 2020 reported increased protective and avoidance behaviours, similar to behaviours promoted to stop the spread of COVID-19.

"Education for sustainable tourism development: an exploratory study of key learning factors","Purpose&gt;This study aims to identify the main facilitating factors in learning sustainable tourism development from the perspective of tourism students.Design/methodology/approach&gt;An inductive qualitative approach was applied. Focus group data collection and content analysis were used to gather and interpret the data obtained from tourism students.Findings&gt;Three major problems prevent tourism students from learning;consequently, three solutions emerged to encourage them to learn about sustainable tourism development. The problems are (1) the complexity of the topic, (2) the applicability of the subject and (3) pessimism about the future. The solutions are (1) implementable sustainable approaches/ideas for the future, (2) the learning process needs to combine field observation and creative approaches and (3) digital tools and video material should be integrated with the learning process.Originality/value&gt;The presentation of sustainable tourism development for tourism students has received relatively limited attention in the literature.

"The mental health support needs of university students with long-term physical health conditions","Purpose&gt;Supporting the mental health of university students is a key priority for higher education. Students living with long-term health conditions are at increased risk of poor mental health;yet little work has focused on their particular mental health needs or indeed, the implications for health education in the university setting. This study sought to identify the mental health support needs of students with long-term conditions, including best ways for universities to support these students.Design/methodology/approach&gt;A UK national online survey of 200 university students living with long-term physical health conditions (e.g. asthma, endometriosis, epilepsy) was conducted in 2019.Findings&gt;95% of respondents reported that their long-term condition/s had at least a moderate impact on their mental wellbeing, with 81% reporting that they felt depressed and anxious at least once a month because of their health. The most common suggestion for how universities can better support their mental wellbeing was to raise awareness about long-term conditions on campuses, with many reporting a lack of understanding about long-term conditions from academic and support services staff members â€“ with negative impacts on their mental health. Because of this, some respondents reported a reluctance to come forward and seek help from university services, with 25% not formally disclosing their conditions.Originality/value&gt;These reported concerns underscore the need to develop health education amongst university staff about long-term conditions and to ensure these students are supported with their health at university.","Wilson, Ceri, Spencer, Grace","https://doi.org/10.1108/HE-01-2022-0004","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Education; 122(5):584-598, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34339,""

Our results show that the public's mental health signals in capital cities were better than those in regional areas. The negative mental health signals in capital cities are associated with a lower level of income, more crowded living space, a lower level of healthcare availability and more difficulties in healthcare access.","Wang, Siqin, Zhang, Mengxi, Huang, Xiao, Hu, Tao, Li, Zhenlong, Sun, Qian Chayn, Liu, Yan","https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsac025","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34341,""
"Navigating challenges during Covid-19 pandemic: experiences and coping strategies of Singapore students","Objectives: This study explores the experiences and coping strategies of secondary students as they engaged in learning activities during the pandemic, It investigated the sources of student stress during the pandemic, and the extent to which the pandemic influenced the stress that they usually experience. Method: Semi-structured interviews were used to elicit details of the students' lived experiences as they navigated learning via an online platform, their coping strategies in managing stress. Results: With regards to academic experiences, many students found online learning challenging and ineffective and were concerned about their examinations. Under social experiences, many students shared that they missed social and recreational activities during the ""circuit breaker"". However, some students demonstrated resilience and were able to see the benefits of going through the pandemic. More students reported academic-related than social-related stress. The students coped with stress in three ways: (1) disengagement, (2) taking active steps and (3) turning to others. Conclusion: Academic concerns were a major source of distress among adolescents, Insights hat were drawn from the results of the study can be utilized to support students in managing stress and mitigate its adverse effects on student learning and functioning. What is already known about this topic: (1) The pandemic has a more serious impact on adolescents' mental health and emotional well-being and many adolescents experience anxiety during this period. (2) Positive reappraisal, strengths use and emotional processing are some strategies used by adolescents to cope with stress during the pandemic. What this topic adds: (1) Although many students found online learning stressful and ineffective, some students in this study had meaningful and positive experiences during the period when they had online lessons at home. (2) Despite the challenges, some students demonstrated resilience and were even able to see the benefits arising from going through the pandemic. Others appreciated spending more time with their family members. (3) Adolescents coped with stress experienced during the pandemic in three ways: (1) disengagement, (2) taking active steps and (3) turning to others.","Soon, Tan Chee, Caleon, Imelda S.; Shaik Kadir, Munirah Binte, Chua, Jenny, Ilham, Nur Qamarina","https://doi.org/10.1080/20590776.2022.2079405","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Educational and Developmental Psychologist;: 1-11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34342,""
"What are the research priorities of Australian early childhood professionals? Results of a Delphi style study","The aims of this study were to establish a Research Network of Early Childhood Professionals and to identity network membersâ€™ top research priorities and preferred research methods. Australian early childhood education (ECE) professionals were invited to participate in a Delphi-style survey. In Stage 1, participants were asked to describe the most important issues in ECE that need addressing;from this, a â€˜top 20â€™ list of the most common research priorities was generated. In Stage 2, respondents were asked to prioritise the top 20 research topics and to rate their interest in participating in various methods of research. A total of 182 ECE professionals completed the Stage 1 survey (pre-COVID-19), yielding 34 topics of research interest. Ninety-four respondents completed the Stage 2 survey (during the COVID-19 pandemic), ranking the top three most important research topics as: educator wellbeing and mental health, child wellbeing and mental health, and professional learning and development. Members of the network appear to be interested in participating in ECE research and their research priorities can help highlight real-world issues warranting further investigation. Facilitating research that addresses prioritised ECE areas is particularly timely given the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the ECE sector.

"The Alternative for Germany (AfD) as Populist Issue Entrepreneur: Explaining the Party and its Voters in the 2021 German Federal Election","This article analyses the vote for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the 2021 German Federal Election. Using the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), we confirm some findings from previous studies, above all that attitudinal variables â€“ including anti-immigrant ideology â€“ are much stronger predictors of the AfD vote than socio-demographic variables. Moreover, we uncover three new findings in relation to vote choice for the AfD. First, anti-EU attitudes had a positive, statistically significant impact on AfD vote choice in 2021. Second, negative attitudes towards political elites increased the probability of voting for the AfD. Third, and perhaps most important, dissatisfaction with the governmentâ€™s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic was positively related to voting for the AfD. Given these results, we argue here that the AfD has become something of a populist â€˜issue entrepreneurâ€™ which, while exploiting existing niches in the electoral marketplace (the EU and migration), is finding new issues to tap and exploit.

"Of Promises and Discontents: Mapping India's Response to Guaranteeing the Right to Mental Health during the Covid-19 Pandemic","As of 2020, close to 1 billion people are living with mental disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed and intensified the shortcomings in guaranteeing the right to mental health, particularly of the marginalized. The article discusses the international human rights framework with the endeavour of highlighting the non-derogability of the right and the obligations imposed on States in pursuance of it. By discussing the Indian experience the article exemplifies that, despite greater normative clarity, practice has not been brought into conformity in most States, resulting in pre-existing lacunae being amplified during the pandemic. The article proceeds to outline recommendations for States to consider by treating India as a global reference. The overarching conclusion is that while the pandemic has made it even more apparent that the implementation of the rights-framework is deficient, it has also provided an opportunity to advance which can only be availed by operationalizing this framework.","Sanghi, Sanskriti, Raushan Tara, Jaswal","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2044251321000576","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of International Law; 12(1):121-156, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34346,""
"Can COVID-19 pandemic worsen previous neurological/psychiatric diseases?","Introduction The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been affecting the world since January 2020. Although its pathogenesis is primarily directed to the respiratory tract, other organs may be affected, including the nervous system. It has also been shown that the social context (confinement, lack of treatment) has affected neurological patients during this period. The aim of the study it was to assess the subjective worsening of neurological/psychiatric diseases in the context of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Methods Three groups of neurological/psychiatric patients were included: Patients who had symptomatic COVID-19 (nÂ =Â 89), patients who had asymptomatic COVID-19 (nÂ =Â 40), and a control group (nÂ =Â 47), consisting of neurological/psychiatric patients without a history of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Results 30.7% of the included individuals considered that their basal pathology had worsened during the study period. This feeling was significantly more frequent (pÂ =Â 0.01) in patients with symptomatic COVID-19 (39.3%) than in patients of the other 2 groups (21.8%). Worsening was not related to the severity of COVID-19. The neurological conditions that significantly worsened after COVID-19, comparing symptomatic COVID-19 with the other 2 groups, were demyelinating and degenerative diseases. Conclusions These results confirmed the impact of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic on patients with neurological/psychiatric diseases. Confinement, lack of medical care, and the threat of diagnÃ³stico are surely contributing factors. Although the finding of a higher frequency of worsening in symptomatic COVID-19 patients may be related to greater anxiety/depression in this group of patients, we cannot exclude the role of direct affectation of the nervous system by the virus or damage due to neuroinflammation. Resumen IntroducciÃ³n La pandemia por SARS-CoV-2 afecta al mundo desde enero de 2020. Aunque su patogenia se dirige principalmente a las vÃ­as respiratorias, otros Ã³rganos pueden verse afectados, incluido el sistema nervioso. TambiÃ©n se ha demostrado que el contexto social (confinamiento, falta de tratamiento) ha afectado a los pacientes neurolÃ³gicos durante este periodo. El objetivo del estudio fue evaluar el empeoramiento subjetivo de enfermedades neurolÃ³gicas/psiquiÃ¡tricas en el contexto de la pandemia por SARS-Cov-2. MÃ©todos Se incluyeron tres grupos de pacientes neurolÃ³gicos/psiquiÃ¡tricos: pacientes que tenÃ­an COVID-19 sintomÃ¡tico (nÂ =Â 89), pacientes que tenÃ­an COVID-19 asintomÃ¡tico (nÂ =Â 40) y un grupo control (nÂ =Â 47), formado por pacientes neurolÃ³gicos/psiquiÃ¡tricos sin antecedentes de infecciÃ³n por SARS-Cov-2. Resultados El 30,7% de los individuos incluidos considerÃ³ que su patologÃ­a basal habÃ­a empeorado durante el perÃ­odo de estudio. Este sentimiento fue significativamente mÃ¡s frecuente (pÂ =Â 0,01) en pacientes con COVID-19 sintomÃ¡tico (39,3%) que en pacientes de los otros 2 grupos (21,8%). El empeoramiento no estuvo relacionado con la gravedad de COVID-19. Las condiciones neurolÃ³gicas que empeoraron significativamente despuÃ©s de la COVID-19, comparando la COVID-19 sintomÃ¡tica con los otros 2 grupos, fueron las enfermedades desmielinizantes y degenerativas. Conclusiones estos resultados confirmaron el impacto de la pandemia del SARS-Cov-2 en pacientes con enfermedades neurolÃ³gicas/psiquiÃ¡tricas. El encierro, la falta de atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica y la amenaza del diagnÃ³stico son seguramente factores contribuyentes. Aunque el hallazgo de una mayor frecuencia de empeoramiento en pacientes sintomÃ¡ticos de COVID-19 puede estar relacionado con una mayor ansiedad/depresiÃ³n en este grupo de pacientes, no podemos excluir el papel de la afectaciÃ³n directa del sistema nervioso por el virus o el daÃ±o por neuroinflamaciÃ³n.","Fleury, AgnÃ¨s, QuiÃ±ones, Manuel Alejandro Del RÃ­o, Cruz, Lucinda Aguirre, Rojas, Andrea Toledo, Hernandez, Ilse Murrieta, Jimenez, Kimberly Santiago, Gutierrez, Eric Uribe, Rodriguez, Luis Miranda, Arrazola, Vidaris Toledo, Hernandez, Walter Soto, SÃ¡nchez, Daniel SÃ¡nchez, Cruz, Lya Fernanda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurop.2022.06.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology Perspectives;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34347,""
"Psychological wellbeing in the English population during the COVID-19 pandemic: A series of cross-sectional surveys","Psychological distress has been elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies published to date have investigated distress after the first wave of infections (Spring â€“ Summer 2020). We investigated distress and wellbeing between April 2020 and April 2022 in England through a series of cross-sectional online surveys. People aged 16 years or over living in the UK were eligible for the surveys;for this study we selected only those living in England due to differences in restrictions between UK nations. Distress was measured using the PHQ4 (nÂ =Â 60,921 responses), while wellbeing was measured using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (nÂ =Â 61,152 responses). Throughout, approximately 50%â€“60% of women and 40%â€“50% of men reported distress, higher than the 25%â€“30% of women, and 20%â€“25% of men reported in normative data. Wellbeing was also worse than population norms, with women reporting lower wellbeing than men. Rates of distress in the English population have been consistently high throughout the pandemic. Patterns of distress have broadly mirrored the pattern of restrictions and case numbers, but there are notable exceptions which indicate that other factors may play a part in population mental health.","Smith, Louise E.; Aml<U+020F>t, Richard, Fear, Nicola T.; Michie, Susan, Rubin, G.

The current study contributes a national snapshot of mental health care utilization, including disruptions, barriers, and modalities, among U.S. adolescents. Method Logistic regressions analyzing self-reports from a representative sample (N=532) of 13 to 17 year-olds recruited from the AmeriSpeak Teen Panel during Spring 2021. Results Few demographic characteristics were associated with disruptions. Text-based communication/chat was most prevalent among minoritized racial and ethnic groups. Parental support was positively associated with finding private space for telehealth visits. Black adolescents were less likely to report in-person visits. Among those unable to receive care, Black adolescents preferred in-person visits. Conclusions Policies enacted to facilitate access to text-based communication/chat should continue to limit disruptions and promote racial equity. Additional efforts should target improving access to in-person visits among Black adolescents. Clinicians should encourage parent/guardian collaboration to facilitate access to private space for telehealth visits.","Campos-Castillo, Celeste, Laestadius, Linnea I.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.06.012","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34349,""

The fact that the COVID-19 virus poses a threat to mental health as well as physical health, the effects of the pandemic period on the psychological needs and anxiety level of adolescents, especially in a critical developmental stage, and the scarcity of studies concerning adolescent mental health in this period, constituted the purpose of the current study. The quantitative (N = 502) and qualitative data (N = 29) of the study, in which triangulation design was used, were collected from high school students studying in the Southeast of Turkey. In the quantitative part of the research Multiple Linear Regression was implemented and content analysis was used in the qualitative part. The results indicate that love, belonging and power, which are subdimensions of basic psychological needs, are significant predictors of anxiety level. Additionally, it is seen that the need for freedom subdimension is the least predictive variable for the anxiety level. It is concluded that there are moderate negative and significant relationships between the general and subdimensions of basic psychological needs and the level of state anxiety. In this sense, it has been found that the level of anxiety tends to decrease as the level of the satisfaction of basic psychological needs increases. The results in the qualitative analysis part largely overlap with the results in the quantitative part. Suggestions based on the findings of the study are made to researchers.

"Implementation of online classes during national school closure due to COVID-19 and mental health symptoms of adolescents: A cross-sectional survey of 5000 students","Aim Online classes were implemented in numerous schools during the school closure due to COVID-19. The present study examined the relationship between online classes during national school closure and mental health symptoms after the reopening of schools. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey from October 1 to November 7, 2020 using an anonymous self-reported questionnaire to evaluate 21 junior and senior high schools in the Saitama prefecture of Japan. Out of the 5538 students who were recruited, 5000 agreed to participate. The relationship between the implementation of online classes and mental health symptoms (emotional symptoms, psychotic experience [PE], and smartphone addiction) was evaluated using mixed-effect logistic regression models, while controlling for individual and class-level covariates (e.g., gender, grades). Results Implementation of online classes was reported by 78.2% of classroom teachers, and it was associated with lower rates of emotional symptoms (OR?=?0.79, 95% CI?=?0.63?0.99, p?=?0.040) and smartphone addiction (OR?=?0.79, 95% CI?=?0.65?0.96, p?=?0.020), but not related to PE (OR?=?0.91, 95% CI?=?0.61?1.36, p?=?0.637). Conclusions Implementing online classes during the national school closure might have had a potential protective effect for adolescents' mental health symptoms (especially emotional symptoms and smartphone addiction) after the reopening of schools during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Morishima, Ryo, Koike, Haruna, Kanehara, Akiko, Usui, Kaori, Okada, Naohiro, Ando, Shuntaro, Kasai, Kiyoto","https://doi.org/10.1002/pcn5.17","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences Reports; 1(2):e17, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34352,""
"Detection and Treatment of Persistent Pollutants in Water: General Review of Pharmaceutical Products","Environmental problems of great complexity arise from the enormous number of toxic substances that are generated by anthropogenic activities. Seemingly, society encounters new issues every day thus these problems seem to be endless. Now in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the SARS-CoV-2 crisis, a large number of emerging treatment compounds generated by pharmaceutical companies worldwide makes future issues even more treacherous. For this reason, there is an increasing need to detect and treat emerging compounds to prevent them from becoming persistent pollutants. This review describes the advances in the use of electrochemical sensors with modified carbon-based electrodes among other issues, to determine antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and antidepressants levels in the environment. It further explores technologies suggested for cleaning wastewater polluted by pharmaceutical products using biological or advanced oxidation processes including photolysis, photocatalysis, microwave heating, ultrasound, Fenton, electro-Fenton, photoelectro-Fenton and various combined treatments.We, the authors, dedicate this report, with love, to all the people afflicted by COVID-19 during the pandemic arising from SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we wish to honor the medical people who have and continue to help affected patients, and the medical researchers who generate the medicines and vaccines for all of us.","Erika Bustos, Bustos, Antonia, Sandoval-GonzÃ¡lez, Carolina, MartÃ­nez-SÃ¡nchez","https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.202200188","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: ChemElectroChem; 9(12), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34353,""
"â€œIs there anything else you would like to tell us?â€: An analysis of language features in text responses to a study on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions have been a major stressor and exacerbated mental health worldwide. Qualitative data play a unique role in documenting mental state, via both language features and content. Within a longitudinal study on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed free responses to the question: â€œIs there anything else you would like to tell us that might be important that we did not ask about?â€ We applied text analysis methods to ask whether individuals who responded to the item differed from non- responders, whether there were associations between language use and psychological status, and to characterize the content of responses and how responses changed over time. 3,655 individuals provided biweekly measures of mental health and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic for 6 months. Of these, 2,497 participants provided at least one free response (9,741 total responses). Response likelihood was influenced by demographic factors and health status: Participants who were male, Asian, Black, or Hispanic were less likely to respond, and odds of responding increased with age and education as well as with a history of physical health conditions. Although mental illness history did not influence an individualâ€™s overall likelihood of responding, it was associated with more negative sentiment, negative word use, and higher usage of first-person singular pronouns. Responses were dynamically influenced by psychological status, such that distress and loneliness were positively associated with an individualsâ€™ likelihood to respond at a given timepoint, and predicted more negativity. Finally, responses were negative in valence overall, exhibited fluctuations linked with external events, and covered a variety of topics, with the most common being mental health and emotion. Our results identify trends in language use during the first year of the pandemic, and suggest that the both the content of responses and overall sentiment are linked to mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xczdg","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34354,""
"Promoting Daily Well-being in Adolescents using mHealth (preprint)","Adolescents are at increased risk for developing mental health problems. The Grow It! app is an mHealth intervention aimed at preventing mental health problems through improving coping by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-inspired challenges as well as self-monitoring of emotions through Experience Sampling Methods (ESM). Yet, little is known about daily changes in well-being and coping during a stressful period, like the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aimed to elucidate daily changes in positive and negative affect, and adaptive coping, and to better understand the within-personâ€™s mechanisms of the Grow It! app. The sample consisted of 12-25-year old Dutch adolescents in two independent cohorts (cohort 1: N = 476, Mage=16.24, 76.1% female, 88.7% Dutch;cohort 2: N = 814, Mage=18.45, 82.8% female, 97.2% Dutch). ESM were used to measure daily positive and negative affect and coping (cohort 1: 42 days, 210 assessments per person;cohort 2: 21 days, 105 assessments). The results showed that, on average, adolescents decreased in daily positive affect and adaptive coping, and increased in their experienced negative affect. A positive relation between adaptive coping and positive affect was found, although independent of the CBT-based challenges. Latent class analysis identified two heterogeneous trajectories for both positive and negative affect, indicating that the majority of participants with low to moderate-risk on developing mental health problems were likely to benefit from the Grow It! app.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pdgh9","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34355,""
"The Positive Psychological Capital and its Influencing Factors among University Students during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Little research has been done on the mental health of western Chinese university students during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This work aims to fill the gap by gaining insight into the positive psychological capital and its influencing factors among university students in western China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in college students from a medical school. Participants were surveyed anonymously using a general information questionnaire and the Positive Psychological Capital Scale. The key factors and models affecting the psychological capital were obtained by using the gradual regression method. If P &lt; 0.05, the difference would be considered statistically significant. Results: The total score of positive psychological capital among university students in western China was 118.51Â±16.91, Taking the psychological capital as the dependent variable, gender and grade as the independent variables, the key factors and models affecting the psychological capital were obtained by using the gradual regression method.The results showed that the P-value of each influencing factor was &lt;0.05. The key influencing factors of psychological capital of college students were gender and and place of residence. Conclusion: The overall positive psychological capital of college students in western China was in good condition during the pandemic, with large room for improvement though. Gender and Residence were independent influencing factors on the positive psychological capital.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1804146/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34356,""
"Desire and motivation for parenthood during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison of cis-gender minoritized sexual identities with cis-heterosexual individuals living in Germany (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the globe and is associated with significant clinical and humanitarian burden. Indeed, the SARS-COV 2 virus has impacted on society asymmetrically: Marginalized social minority groups, such as individuals who do not exclusively sexually identify as heterosexual, represent a vulnerable population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. While higher rates of anxiety and depression have been reported in individuals with minoritized sexual identities (compared to heterosexual individuals) during the COVID-19 pandemic, the specific impact of the pandemic and its social restriction measures on this population is poorly understood. Methods: : From April to July 2020, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey online among N = 2463 adults living in Germany. We screened for depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4;PHQ-4) and assessed individualsâ€™ desire for parenthood during the pandemic, and motives for or against the desire for parenthood (Leipzig questionnaire on motives for having a child, Version 20;LKM-20), with the aim of identifying differences between individuals with minoritized sexual identities and heterosexual individuals. Results: : Compared to heterosexual individuals (n = 1304), individuals with minoritized sexual identities (n = 831) indicated higher levels of depressive symptoms. In our study sample the majority of all participantsâ€™ (81.9%) reported no change in the desire for parenthood since the COVID-19 pandemic. The ranking of the motives for parenthood did not change since the pandemic in heterosexuals and individuals with minoritized sexual identities. Nevertheless, both subgroups scored lower in all motives compared to the time before the pandemic. Conclusions: : The findings underline the unmet need for social, psychological and medical support in regard to family planning and the desire for parenthood during the pandemic. Furthermore, future research should explore COVID-19-related psychological consequences on individualsâ€™ desire for parenthood and building a family.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1794441/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34357,""
"Making it work: the experiences of delivering a community mental health service during the COVID 19 pandemic (preprint)","Purpose:  The aim of this study was to explore how Community Mental Health Teams (CMHT) staff responded to delivering a service in a crisis. Background:  The pandemic forced rapid and innovative change to care delivery. Knowledge about staff experiences may contribute to different approaches to managing staff during future pandemics and could be used in the design and implementation of interventions to support frontline mental health staff working to deliver community services. Methods: : A qualitative semi-structured interview approach was adopted. Twenty-one staff from a CMHT in the North West of England, UK were recruited and interviewed remotely. Interviews took place in June and July 2020, three months after the UK entered its first national lockdown. Results: : Analysis identified the approaches used by staff, from senior leadership down to those on the frontline, to try to make the service work in difficult circumstances. At every level of the organization staff talked about the challenges and strategies arising from a desire to deliver a service during the pandemic. The data is discussed under four headings;â€˜senior trust managers trying to make it workâ€™, â€˜individuals making it workâ€™, â€˜making it work as a teamâ€™;and â€˜making it work through working at homeâ€™. Clear communication of messages proved key across all areas, to ensure that government guidelines were followed, and that contact with service users and care delivery was directed at keeping people safe. Conclusion:  In this study it was clear that the initial response to the pandemic involved the imposition of boundaries on staff by the Trust senior leadership to ensure the most vulnerable service users received a service while staff were kept safe. The data raises questions about how these boundaries were determined and whether the same outcome could have been achieved through involving staff more in the making of decisions about the delivery of services.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1714616/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34358,""
"COVID-19 vaccination trends and side effects among Egyptian hemodialysis patients: a multicenter survey study (preprint)","Background:  Patients on chronic hemodialysis (CHD) for end stage kidney disease (ESKD) face unique circumstances that increase their risk of infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Vaccination may be a key intervention to prevent infection in these patients. This study aimed to determine the COVID-19 vaccination status in Egyptian CHD patients and analyze the safety and detailed side effect profile of COVID-19 vaccine among these patients. Methods: : This survey-based study conducted on 670 ESRD patients on CHD at the period from 3 December 2021 to 5 February 2022. Subjects were asked about sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and therapeutic data, history of COVID-19 infection, associated symptoms and sequalae in addition to their COVID-19 vaccination status. If the subject had been vaccinated, we inquired about the type of vaccine and the side effects that occurred within few days after administrating of the first and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, subjects were inquired about the onset of side effects (days from vaccination), timing of maximum symptoms, intensity of symptoms and their effect on activity and need for medical attention. Results: : The study included 670 CHD patients with mean age of 50.79 years ,58.1% were females. Of them, one hundred and seventy-three patients (25.8%) had previously been infected with COVID-19. About three fourths (72.2%) reported that healthcare providers (HCP) strongly endorsed COVID-19 vaccine. The vast majority (614;91.6%) of the studied patients received 2 doses of the vaccine. AstraZeneca and Sinopharm were the most used vaccines (50.3% and 35.5% respectively). Side effects were commonly reported after the first dose than the second dose. The main general side effects that reported after the first dose were generalized weakness/fatigue (56%), headache (43.8%) and fever (40.4%). Sore arm/pain was reported in about one third (29.3%) after the first dose. Myalgia and generalized muscle pain was reported in 90 (14.7%) patients after the first dose and 9 (1.5%) after both doses. Anxiety (25.4%), psychological stress (12.9%), increase in sleep (9.3%), depression (2.8%) and decrease in memory (2%) were reported among recipients after the first dose and rarely reported after the second one. Adverse events mostly occurred within one day after vaccination and the maximum symptoms usually happened at the second day. The median duration of symptoms was 3 days with maximum duration up to 5 days. Only 4.2% required transient time off from work. Conclusions: : Our preliminary findings support the favorable short term safety profile of COVID-19 vaccine among CHD patients and hence, can reassure both clinicians and patients, as well as promote further COVID-19 vaccine administration among these patients.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1708026/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34359,""
"A Double Blinded Randomised Controlled Trial of Vitamin a Drops to Treat Post-viral Olfactory Loss: Study Protocol for a Proof-of-concept Study for Vitamin a Nasal Drops in Post-viral Olfactory Loss (Apollo) (preprint)","Background:  Loss of smell or olfactory dysfunction (OD)s a common yet under- addressed problem with an estimated 5% of the general population having no functioning sense of smell. OD secondary to viral infections (eg: Covid-19) is one of the leading causes. Isolation, depression, anxiety, risk of danger from hazards such as toxic gas and spoiled food, weight loss/ gain secondary to loss of appetite are all prevalent negative impacts associated with OD. Various treatment options have been tried to treat smell loss after viral infection. Smell training has been tried with good results in the immediate post-viral phase. Evidence behind treatment with steroids has not shown to have proven effectiveness. With this, a key problem for patients and their clinicians is the lack of proven an effective therapeutic treatment option. Based on previous studies, there is some evidence supporting the regenerative potential of retinoic acid, the metabolically active form of Vitamin A in regeneration of olfactory receptor neurons. It is based on this concept that we have chosen Vitamin A as our study comparator in this two-arm randomised trial to determine proof of concept Methods: /Design: The study will compare 10,000 IU once daily Vitamin A self-administered intranasal drops versus peanut oil drops (placebo) delivered over 12 weeks in patients with post viral olfactory loss. Eligible patients will be recruited from the Smell & Taste Clinic and randomised to receive vitamin A drops or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. They will then be invited to attend the Brain Imaging Centre at the University of East Anglia on two occasions, 3 months apart, Serial MRI scanning will enable volumetric measurement of the OB and ROS;fMRI will then be conducted using an olfactometer to deliver pulsed odours â€“ phenethylalcohol (rose-like) and hydrogen sulphide (rotten eggs). Participants will also undergo a standard smell test at both visits as well as complete a quality-of-life questionnaire. Change in OB volume on MRI will be the primary outcome measure. Discussion:  We expect the outputs of this study to enable a subsequent randomised controlled trial of Vitamin A versus placebo. With PPI input we will make the outputs publicly available using journals, conferences and social media via Fifth Sense. We have already prepared a draft RCT proposal in partnership with the Norwich Clinical Trials Unit and would plan to develop this further considering the findings.

"Immersive Therapy for Improving Anxiety in Health Professionals of a Regional Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Quasi-Experimental Pilot Study (preprint)","Background:  Immersive therapy through virtual reality represents a novel strategy used in psychological interventions, but there is still a need to strengthen the evidence on its effects on health professionals&rsquo;mental health. Objective: To analyze the results of immersive therapy through virtual reality in the levels of anxiety and secondly, well-being of the health professionals working in a regional hospital in Olot (Spain). Methods: Pilot quasi-experimental study including a group of 35 women (mean age=45.7, SD=8.43) health professionals who undertook immersive therapy for 8 weeks. The intervention was implemented through virtual reality, and its effect on anxiety levels and well-being was evaluated through the Hamilton and Eudemon scales, respectively. Data on age, gender, active pharmacological or psychological treatment, mental health disorders and number of sessions were also collected. Results: Statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) improvement in anxiety and well-being was found, with large and moderate effect sizes (0.90 and 0.63 respectively). In addition, these changes were clinically significant. No significant associations were found between the improvements and the different variables, but a greater trend was identified among the group of professionals with untreated or unidentified levels of anxiety. Conclusion: This group of health professionals showed statistically and clinically significant improvement in anxiety and well-being after the application of immersive therapy using virtual reality. Further studies with a control group are necessary to further analyze this novel intervention.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202207.0079.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34361,""
"Returning to work at school during the COVID -19 pandemic, is it stressful for schoolteachers? Assessment of immediate psychological effects: a cross sectional study (preprint)","Background:  Â The adoption of remote classes for students has been in vogue since the onset of the pandemic. Schools reopened in a phased manner after the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India. Reverting to the regular face-to-face teaching for students became a challenge to the teachers and students, especially at times when there was an impending third wave on the way. The study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers who attended reopened schools in the scenario of face-to-face classes. In addition, we studied the association of psychological symptoms with teachers' age groups, gender, school boards, and school institution type. Methods: : Â A cross-sectional study was conducted between October to December 2021 after schools had reopened. Data was collected using Google Form questionnaires in 124 schoolteachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire assessed the psychological symptoms. Results: :Â  Of 124 schoolteachers, 108(87.1%) were female, 112 (90.3%) were from private institutions, and 70(56.5%) were from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school boards. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers was 30.6%, 45.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 80% of the female teachers expressed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Amongst all the age groups, symptoms were higher in 40-49 group. We found anxiety to be statistically significant when compared with gender (p-0.042). We found no statistically significant differences concerning age groups, school boards, or school institutions with any psychological symptoms. Conclusions: : Â The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high among schoolteachers after schools reopened for regular face-to-face teaching. Gender was associated with anxiety in teachers. We agree that identifying teachers' symptoms and providing adequate psychological counseling/support would improve their mental health status and thereby the quality of teaching to students.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.110720.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34362,""
"MENTAL STATUS OVERVIEW IN THE ELDERLY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A PHYLOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE (preprint)","Background:  During the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a change in the mental status of the elderly, namely anxiety disorders and depression. It is important to know the mental status of the elderly and the role of effective communication because elderly people are easily infected with Covid-19.

"A Desk Top Study: Impact of COVID-19 in the Economy of Nepal (preprint)","Nepal is an underdeveloped country. Twenty-five percent of its GDP depends on remittance, and the rest on agriculture, tourism, and industries. The foreign currency earning sector is remittance and tourism. All the sectors have a direct impact of COVID-19 on economic growth;the impact on education is immeasurable since it would be seen in the long term. The world economy suffered due to COVID-19 and likewise the economy of Nepal, all sectors were in the negative except agriculture. The migrant workers around eight hundred thousand (800000) returned home and cultivated their land. There was slow remittance inflow in the country and strained the foreign reserve of the country. It might have supported a bit of the agriculture sector. The tourism sector is heavily affected: only two hundred thousand tourists arrived in 2020, hotels were in lockdown, and workers were out of jobs, this sector has wider impacts in different sectors including industries, shopkeepers, travelers, and others. Altogether 9 million students have been affected in pre-primary to secondary schools and 6 lakhs students were from tertiary education. The impact is immeasurable since it has a long-lasting effect on the academic physical and mental health of young people. The economy is slowly returning to its normality but to heal the scar it needs time, the government has been trying to fund the areas where necessary. The government needs to increase agriculture industries and production to attract youth to the profession and create employment in the small micro-enterprises and industries.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Desk+Top+Study:+Impact+of+COVID-19+in+the+Economy+of+Nepal+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34365,""
"Understanding clinical decision-making in mesothelioma care: a mixed methods study","Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare, incurable cancer arising from previous asbestos exposure; patients have a poor prognosis, with a median survival rate of 8-14 months. Variation in mesothelioma clinical decision-making remains common with a lack of multidisciplinary knowledge sharing, leading to inconsistencies in treatment decisions. The study aimed to explore which factors impacted on clinicians' decision-making in mesothelioma care, with a view to optimising the mesothelioma care pathway. This mixed methods study consisted of documentary analysis of local and national guidelines, policies or documents pertaining to mesothelioma care pathways, secondary analysis of mesothelioma patient data, and interviews with clinicians attending lung cancer and/or mesothelioma-specific multidisciplinary team meetings. The study took place at three National Health Service trusts in England. Documentations relating to patients' treatment pathways were collated and reviewed qualitatively. Records of patients with mesothelioma were extracted from hospital patient records and data collected on diagnosis date, treatment, mortality rates, survival postdiagnosis, age and clinical care team. Data were statistically analysed. Interviews with clinicians explored influences on clinical decision-making, including challenges or barriers involved. Data were thematically analysed. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting checklist was used. There were differences in the structure and delivery of mesothelioma treatment and care between trusts. Four main themes were identified: 'collaboration and communication', 'evidence base and knowledge', 'role of the clinician' and 'role of the patient'. Two cross-cutting themes relating to the role of the mesothelioma nurse specialist and the impact of COVID-19 were identified. There is a need to review the structure of mesothelioma multidisciplinary team meetings to ensure patients are reviewed by clinicians with appropriate knowledge, expertise and understanding of how, why and when decisions should be made. There is a need for expert clinicians in mesothelioma care to promote an up-to-date evidence and knowledge base within the wider multidisciplinary team.","Henshall, Dawson, Rahman, Ball, Sundralingam, Shahidi, McKeown, Park, Walthall, Davey","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2022-001312","20220715","Asbestos Induced Lung Disease; Mesothelioma; Palliative Care; Pleural Disease; Rare lung diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34366,""
"Early Onset Cardiovascular Disease from Cocaine, Amphetamines, Alcohol, and Marijuana","Cardiovascular disease (CVD), a disease typically associated with aging and the definitive leading cause of death worldwide, now threatens the young and middle-aged populations. Recreational abuse of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and amphetamine-type stimulants has been an escalating public health problem for decades, but now use of these substances has become a significant contributor to early onset CVD. While this remains a global phenomenon, the epicenter of substance abuse is rooted in North America where it has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time in history, the United States (US) crossed 100,000 overdose-related deaths in a calendar year. Sadly, Canada's recreational drug abuse problem closely mirrors that of the US. This is indicative of the larger public health crisis unfolding, as we now know that these substances are cardiotoxic and are contributing to the rising levels of premature chronic CVD, including hypertension, arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, arterial dissection, sudden cardiac death and early mortality.","O'Keefe, Dhore, Lavie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2022.06.027","20220715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34367,""
"Treatment with stimulants and the risk of COVID-19 complications in adults with ADHD","Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have shown higher infection rates and worse outcomes from COVID-19. Stimulant medications are prescribed as the first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and mitigate risk of negative ADHD-related health outcomes, but little is known about the association between stimulant medications and COVID-19 outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes among people with ADHD who were prescribed stimulant medications versus those who were not. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records in the TriNetX research database. We assessed records of adults with ADHD diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. The stimulant cohort consisted of 28,011 people with at least one stimulant prescription; the unmedicated cohort comprised 42,258 people without prescribed stimulants within 12 months prior to their COVID infection. Multiple logistic regression modeling was utilized to assess the presence of critical care services or death within 30 days after the onset of COVID diagnoses, controlling for patient demographics, and comorbid medical and mental health conditions. The stimulant cohort was less likely to utilize emergency department, hospital, and intensive care services than the unmedicated cohort, and had significantly lower 30-day mortality. Further research, including prospective studies, is needed to confirm and refine these findings.","Tuan, Babinski, Rabago, Zgierska","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2022.07.005","20220715","ADHD; COVID-19; prescription stimulants; substance use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34368,""
"The effect of different degrees of lockdown and self-identified gender on anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic: Data from the international COMET-G study","During the COVID-19 pandemic various degrees of lockdown were applied by countries around the world. It is considered that such measures have an adverse effect on mental health but the relationship of measure intensity with the mental health effect has not been thoroughly studied. Here we report data from the larger COMET-G study pertaining to this question. During the COVID-19 pandemic, data were gathered with an online questionnaire from 55,589 participants from 40 countries (64.85% females aged 35.80Ã‚Â Ã‚Â± 13.61; 34.05% males aged 34.90Ã‚Â±13.29 and 1.10% other aged 31.64Ã‚Â±13.15). Anxiety was measured with the STAI, depression with the CES-D and suicidality with the RASS. Distress and probable depression were identified with the use of a previously developed cut-off and algorithm respectively. It included the calculation of Relative Risk (RR), Factorial ANOVA and Multiple backwards stepwise linear regression analysis RESULTS: Approximately two-thirds were currently living under significant restrictions due to lockdown. For both males and females the risk to develop clinical depression correlated significantly with each and every level of increasing lockdown degree (RR 1.72 and 1.90 respectively). The combined lockdown and psychiatric history increased RR to 6.88 The overall relationship of lockdown with severity of depression, though significant was small. The current study is the first which reports an almost linear relationship between lockdown degree and effect in mental health. Our findings, support previous suggestions concerning the need for a proactive targeted intervention to protect mental health more specifically in vulnerable groups.","Fountoulakis, Karakatsoulis, Abraham, Adorjan, Ahmed, AlarcÃƒÂ³n, Arai, Auwal, Berk, Bjedov, Bobes, Bobes-Bascaran, Bourgin-Duchesnay, Bredicean, Bukelskis, Burkadze, Abud, Castilla-Puentes, Cetkovich, Colon-Rivera, Corral, Cortez-Vergara, Crepin, De Berardis, Delgado, De Lucena, De Sousa, Stefano, Dodd, Elek, Elissa, Erdelyi-Hamza, Erzin, Etchevers, Falkai, Farcas, Fedotov, Filatova, Fountoulakis, Frankova, Franza, Frias, Galako, Garay, Garcia-ÃƒÂlvarez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Portilla, Gonda, Gondek, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Gould, Grandinetti, Grau, Groudeva, Hagin, Harada, Hasan, Hashim, Hilbig, Hossain, Iakimova, Ibrahim, Iftene, Ignatenko, Irarrazaval, Ismail, Ismayilova, Jacobs, JakovljeviÃ„â€¡, JakÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡, Javed, Kafali, Karia, Kazakova, Khalifa, Khaustova, Koh, Kopishinskaia, Kosenko, Koupidis, Kovacs, Kulig, Lalljee, Liewig, Majid, Malashonkova, Malik, Malik, Mammadzada, Mandalia, Marazziti, MarÃ„Âinko, Martinez, Matiekus, Mejia, Memon, MartÃƒÂ­nez, MickeviÃ„ÂiÃ…Â«tÃ„â€”, Milev, Mohammed, Molina-LÃƒÂ³pez, Morozov, Muhammad, MustaÃ„Â, Naor, Nassieb, Navickas, Okasha, Pandova, Panfil, Panteleeva, Papava, Patsali, Pavlichenko, Pejuskovic, Da Costa, Popkov, Popovic, Raduan, RamÃƒÂ­rez, Rancans, Razali, Rebok, Rewekant, Flores, Rivera-Encinas, Saiz, de Carmona, MartÃƒÂ­nez, Saw, Saygili, Schneidereit, Shah, Shirasaka, Silagadze, Sitanggang, Skugarevsky, Spikina, Mahalingappa, Stoyanova, Szczegielniak, Tamasan, Tavormina, Tavormina, Theodorakis, Tohen, Tsapakis, Tukhvatullina, Ullah, Vaidya, Vega-Dienstmaier, Vrublevska, Vukovic, Vysotska, Widiasih, Yashikhina, Prezerakos, Smirnova","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114702","20220715","COVID-19; Depression; Mental health, lockdown, anxiety, mental health history; Suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34369,""
"Top 20 Research Studies of 2021 for Primary Care Physicians","This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2021 identified as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters) that did not address the COVID-19 pandemic. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prevent adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Most older adults (mean age, 75 years) with prediabetes do not progress to diabetes. Among patients in this age group with type 2 diabetes treated with medication, an A1C level of less than 7% is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia, especially when using a sulfonylurea or insulin. For patients with chronic low back pain, exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, duloxetine, and opioids were shown to be more effective than control in achieving a 30% reduction in pain, but self-discontinuation of duloxetine and opioids was common. There is no clinically important difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain. In patients with chronic pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports exercise, yoga, massage, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. For acute musculoskeletal pain, acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, plus ibuprofen, 400 mg, without an opioid is a good option. Regarding screening for colorectal cancer, trial evidence supports performing fecal immunochemical testing every other year. For chronic constipation, evidence supports polyethylene glycol, senna, fiber supplements, magnesium-based products, and fruit-based products. The following abdominal symptoms carry a greater than 3% risk of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease: dysphagia or change in bowel habits in men; rectal bleeding in women; and abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or dyspepsia in men and women older than 60 years. For secondary prevention in those with established arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 81 mg of aspirin daily appears to be effective. The Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations both overestimate the risk of cardiovascular events. Over 12 years, no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular events was demonstrated. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and venlafaxine provide clinically meaningful improvements in chronic neuropathic pain. In patients with moderate to severe depression, initial titration above the minimum starting dose of antidepressants in the first eight weeks of treatment is not more likely to increase response. In adults with iron deficiency anemia, adding vitamin C to oral iron has no effect. In children with pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, or acute otitis media, providing education combined with a take-and-hold antibiotic prescription results in 1 in 4 of those children eventually taking an antibiotic.","Ebell, Grad","https://www.google.com/search?q=Top+20+Research+Studies+of+2021+for+Primary+Care+Physicians.","20220715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34370,""
"Differential impact in suicide mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","To compare the suicide rates observed in Brazil after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with the estimated number based on suicide deaths between 2010 and 2020, and to identify sociodemographic variables associated with this outcome. An ecological time-series study. Data were obtained from DATASUS, with the structural break of the data set in March 2020. The number of observed suicides and the number of the expected, if there were no COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed through Bayesian Models of structural time series. There was stability in Brazil's overall incidence of suicides after the beginning COVID-19 pandemic, compared to what would be expected. However, there was a significant increase in death in women (6.9%) and in the elderly (9.1%). The analysis according to the macro-region showed a significant increase in death in the Central West (7.4%), Northeast (5.7%), and Southeast (10%). Stratified analyzes revealed differences according to the group assessed considering particularities such as age, sex, schooling, and skin color. Despite the general stability in the number of suicides, this occurs heterogeneously among population groups in different regions of Brazil. There is an increase in populations with a history of poor access to health, which may have been more severely impacted by the pandemic.","Ornell, Benzano, Borelli, Narvaez, Moura, Passos, Sordi, Schuch, Kessler, Scherer, Diemen","https://doi.org/10.47626/1516-4446-2022-2581","20220715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34371,""
"The socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19 among rural and urban-slum dwellers in Ghana: A mixed methods approach","Vulnerable populations such as rural and urban-slum dwellers are more likely to suffer greatly from the deleterious effects of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, in Ghana, most COVID-19 mitigating packages are not focused on vulnerable populations. Concurrent mixed methods design was used to examine the socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19 among rural and urban-slum dwellers in Ghana. Four hundred respondents were sampled for the quantitative arm of the study, while 46 In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted with community members and government officials. Sixty-four community members participated in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and non-participant observation was carried out for three months. Quantitative data were analysed using frequencies, percentages, Pearson Chi2 and ordered logistic regression. Interviews were recorded using digital recorders and later transcribed. Transcribed data (IDIs, FGDs) and observation notes were uploaded onto a computer and transferred to qualitative software NVivo 12 to support thematic coding and analysis. Majority of the respondents confirmed the deleterious socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19 on jobs and prices of food. Other effects were fear of visiting a health facility even when unwell, depression and anxiety. Young people (18-32 years), males, urban-slum dwellers, married individuals, the employed and low-income earners (those who earn GHC10/$1.7 to GHC100/ $17), were more likely to suffer from the socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19. Urban-slum dwellers coped by relying on family and social networks for food and other basic necessities, while rural dwellers created locally appropriate washing aids to facilitate hand washing in the rural communities. COVID-19 and the government's mitigation measures had negative socio-economic and health effects on vulnerable communities. While vulnerable populations should be targeted for the government's COVID-19 mitigating packages, special attention should be given to young people (18-32 years), males, urban-slum dwellers, married individuals and low-income earners. Communities should be encouraged to maintain coping strategies adopted even after COVID-19.","Aberese-Ako, Immurana, Dalaba, Anumu, Ofosu, Gyapong","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271551","20220715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34372,""

Using an online questionnaire, subjective judgments of the perceived length of the preceding 12 months were taken. In addition, measures of affect, task load and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction, physical activity, conformity with regulations, perceived covid risk and shielding status were taken. The results showed that only 9% of participants reported that the preceding 12 months felt like 12 months.

"Broadband access and telemedicine adoption for opioid use disorder treatment in the United States","Buprenorphine utilization remains low in the United States. Telemedicine guidelines and flexibilities introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity to increase patient access to buprenorphine. However, it is not known whether Americans without access to buprenorphine waivered provider, especially those residing in rural counties, have sufficient broadband internet access to support telemedicine. Administrative data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator Tool and the Fixed Broadband Deployment Data from the Federal Communications Commission are utilized to identify counties with low broadband penetration rate and the number of buprenorphine waivered providers with capacity to accept patients within a 30 miles radius. 23.9% of the US population does not have access to any buprenorphine waivered provider with a capacity to accept new patients within a 30 miles radius. In counties with low broadband penetration rate, 78.9% of residents does not have access to any buprenorphine waivered provider with patient capacity. In rural counties with low broadband penetration rate, 82.3% of the residents does not have access to any buprenorphine waivered provider with patient capacity within a 30 miles radius. Federal policy initiatives are expected to continue the COVID-19-related telehealth flexibilities and to increase the number of providers available to prescribe buprenorphine, but for that to translate into more patients utilizing treatment via telemedicine, high-speed internet access will be essential. This is particularly salient for residents in rural counties where access to both buprenorphine providers and high-speed internet access is limited.","Ali, Ghertner","https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12699","20220715","broadband; buprenorphine; high-speed internet; opioid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34374,""

"Psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms of pregnant and postnatal women diagnosed with COVID-19: A qualitative study","There is a paucity of data on the psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms among pregnant and postnatal women with COVID-19 infection. We, therefore, aimed to explore the psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms of pregnant and postnatal women diagnosed with COVID-19 at tertiary-level hospitals. This was a qualitative phenomenological study conducted in 2021 with a sample size of 16 women admitted at two referral hospitals serving as COVID-19 admission facilities for pregnant and postnatal women in Lusaka, Zambia. In-depth interviews were conducted via telephone to understand what these women experienced when diagnosed with COVID-19. All the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted using the six steps approach to develop emerging themes. Two major themes emerged: psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms. The primary psychosocial issues were worry and stigma. Women worried about infecting their unborn baby or neonate, being separated from the baby, the general safety of the baby, and the health of other family members. Women also worried about the attitude of health care providers and faced discrimination or stigma because of their infection. Thus, some coping mechanisms were developed that helped them, such as a positive attitude, keeping the disease secret, reliance on family members for support and using positive information from social media. This study provides unique insights into the psychosocial experiences of pregnant and postnatal women diagnosed with COVID-19. Women were particularly concerned about the unborn baby's well-being and discrimination.This study suggests the need for policy and clinical practice to consider the integration of effective mental health services into the provision of maternal health and COVID-19 services.","Kabwe, Lubeya, Phiri, Mulenga, Siulapwa, Kaonga, Price, Phiri, Jacobs","https://doi.org/10.1177/17455057221111326","20220715","SARS-CoV-2; Zambia; mental health; perinatal women; sub-Saharan Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34376,""

Using data from the German Family Panel, we compared three dimensions of mental health (i.e., self-reported stress, exhaustion, and loneliness) one year before the pandemic and in spring 2020. First, two-parent families emerged as a vulnerable group, as the levels of stress and exhaustion they reported during the pandemic converged with those experienced by single parents. Second, a gender gap emerged during this global health crisis, with women, and particularly mothers, reporting significantly worse mental health compared to men in the same family type. Our findings underline the substantive value of studying mental health inequality from a multidimensional perspective and over time.

We conducted a two-arm randomized controlled trial of the CSI with Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with an intent-to-treat design, from September 2019-December 2020. A total of 480 caregivers from 240 families were randomized to the CSI or a waitlist control group (1:1). Retention from baseline to endline was 93%. Data on parenting and caregiver psychological wellbeing were collected at baseline, endline, and three-month follow-up. Prospective trial registration: ISRCTN22321773. We did not find a significant change on overall parenting skills at endline (primary outcome endpoint) (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.11, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.126) or at follow-up (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.15, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.054). We did find a significant effect on overall parenting skills among participants receiving the full intervention-the sub-sample not interrupted by (COVID-19) (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). The CSI showed beneficial effects in the full sample at endline and follow-up on harsh parenting (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.17, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.19, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), parenting knowledge (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.63, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.50, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and caregiver distress (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.33, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.23, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). We found no effects on parental warmth and responsiveness, psychosocial wellbeing, stress, or stress management. Changes in caregiver wellbeing partially mediated the impact of the CSI on harsh parenting, accounting for 37% of the reduction in harsh parenting. The CSI reduced harsh parenting and caregiver distress, and demonstrated the value of addressing caregiver wellbeing as a pathway to strengthening parenting in adversity. These effects were achieved despite a pandemic-related lockdown that impacted implementation, a severe economic crisis, and widespread social unrest. Replication under less extreme conditions may more accurately demonstrate the intervention's full potential.","Miller, Chen, Koppenol-Gonzalez, Bakolis, Arnous, Tossyeh, El Hassan, Saleh, Saade, Nahas, Abboud, Jawad, Jordans","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13668","20220715","Parenting; distress; refugees; stress; war","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34379,""
"Short report: social identification, quality of professional life and emotional maladjustment in healthcare providers during the first wave of the COVID-19 emergency","This research analyzed the effect of professional, organizational and care-unit identifications on both healthcare professionals' quality of professional life and mental health. This research was done in a local hospital in a region of northern Italy which was one of the first regions to be impacted by the first wave of the pandemic. Using a cross-sectional research, a web-based questionnaire was sent to the healthcare professionals. Professional quality of life, professional identifications as well as emotional maladjustment in terms of stress, anxiety and depression were measured. Results indicated that professional and care unit identification were positively linked to increased compassion satisfaction and reduced burnout. Professional identification was negatively associated with secondary traumatic stress as well, while care unit identification was positively associated with vicarious trauma. The negative dimension of the professional quality of life had positive relations with emotional maladjustment. Professional and care unit identifications appeared to have an indirect effect via professional quality of life on maladjustment.","Caricati, Cera, Panari, Bonetti, Sollami, Monacelli","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2099557","20220715","Professional quality of life; emotional maladjustment; pandemic; professional identifications; secondary traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34380,""

"Military Behavioral Health Staff Perspectives on Telehealth Following the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted sweeping changes to behavioral health care delivery in the Military Health System (MHS), which turned to telehealth to minimize disruptions and ensure continuity of care for service members. Four to seven months into the pandemic, MHS behavioral health staff at ten military treatment facilities shared their experiences using telehealth and their perspectives on its utility, barriers to its wider integration in the MHS, and concerns about its use in the post-pandemic future. Telehealth use was previously low across the MHS, but it increased dramatically with the onset of the pandemic. At the time they were interviewed, nearly all providers who treated service members with posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or substance use disorders were using audio-only telehealth in some capacity. Although most were not using video telehealth, three-quarters expressed an openness to using it in the future. However, the widespread integration of telehealth in the MHS will need to include efforts to overcome technical and administrative barriers and to address provider concerns about telehealth modalities for behavioral health care delivery-for example, the need for clinical guidance on using telehealth with specific types of patients, and provider and patient orientation on using telehealth technology.","Hepner, Sousa, Hummer, Pincus, Brown","https://www.google.com/search?q=Military+Behavioral+Health+Staff+Perspectives+on+Telehealth+Following+the+Onset+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20220715","Mental Health Treatment; Military Health and Health Care; Substance Use Disorder Treatment; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34382,""
"Pre-pandemic Physical Function and Social Network in Relation to COVID-19-Associated Depressive Burden in Older Adults in Sweden","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the measures intended to limit its spread, have likely affected older adults' depressive burden. Good physical functioning and a rich social network may benefit older adults' mental health. We examined whether pre-pandemic physical functioning and social network were associated with depressive burden during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden. A telephone assessment of depressive burden using the symptoms of sadness, anxiety, worrying, reduced sleep, and reduced appetite was conducted in May-September 2020 in 930 older adults from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), an ongoing population-based study. Objective measures of gait speed, muscle strength, and balance; and self-reports of social connections and support were collected in 2016-2019. Logistic models were adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, lifestyle, and pandemic-related factors (loneliness, change in physical and social engagement, and experience of death due to COVID-19). Only good muscle strength (odds ratio [OR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.85; ref: poor strength, Ã¢â€°Â¥17 s) and rich social support (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45-0.99; ref: poor support) exhibited an independent association with depressive burden, even after accounting for pandemic-related factors. A combination of good muscle strength and rich social support were associated with the greatest reduction in depressive burden (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.18-0.66; ref: poor social support and poor muscle strength).

"Mental Health in Postoperative Thyroid Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Little is known about mental health in patients after thyroid surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. This study aimed to assess the mental health of postoperative thyroid patients and to explore potential factors associated with psychological symptoms. In this study, we surveyed 241 patients who underwent thyroid surgery at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Insomnia, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. A significant proportion of postoperative patients reported experiencing insomnia, anxiety, depression, and PTSS. Patients that were older, single/divorced/widowed, and less educated; had lower income and poor general health; had undergone surgery within the past six months; had disrupted follow-up, and; searched social media for COVID-19-related information were associated with worse mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, postoperative thyroid patients tended to develop mental health problems and have less psychological support, emphasizing the importance of patient education and psychological interventions.","Yang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.875325","20220715","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; thyroid surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34384,""
"Assessment of Insomnia and Associated Factors Among Patients Who Have Recovered from COVID-19 in Vietnam","The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the lives of millions of people globally. Patients recovering from COVID-19 are facing, not only the symptom of long COVID, but also psychological problems, such as sleep disturbance. This study aims to assess the proportion of COVID-19 recovered adult patients that suffer from insomnia and associated factors in Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was performed between January and March 2022 among patients who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection. Data were collected based on a self-administered questionnaire that included sociodemographic and standardized questionnaires from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Perceived stress scale (PSS) and the dependent variable using Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to explore factors associated with the patients' insomnia disorder. A total of 325 participants were included in this analysis, 34.5% of participants had insomnia. According to multivariable logistic regression, participants who were equal to and over 50 years of age, feeling alienated from others, and were not supported by families or relatives, reported significantly higher levels of insomnia disorders over those aged under 50 years, having closer ties with family and had received support from family or relatives. Besides, respondents who recorded mental health problems that included anxiety, depression and stress were more likely to get insomnia disorders than those without mental health symptoms (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.6) (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.3-8.9) (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.3), respectively, all p &lt; 0.05. There was a remarkable rate of COVID-19 recovered patients experiencing insomnia disorders. Older age, alienated relationships and not being supported by families or relatives, as well as had mental health problems, are factors that affected the patients' insomnia, which showed that these sleep issues need to be screened and managed among adults who have recovered from COVID-19.","Huynh, Nguyen, Vo, Le, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S371563","20220715","COVID-19; Vietnam; insomnia; recovery; sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34385,""
"COVID-19-related psychiatric manifestations requiring hospitalization: Analysis in older vs younger patients","The complex manifestations of COVID-19 include psychiatric symptoms, having multifaceted profiles with varying severity during the acute phase and further during the recovery period. Limited data exist which have analyzed whether there are any age-related differences. A study lot of 89 COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization for mental issues provided comparative data from two age groups below and above 60 years. The majority of patients had new onset of a mental issue during COVID-19, 24.7% of the total lot being diagnosed with depressive disorder. The senior patient set had a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disorder vs. the younger study group (53.3 vs. 28.8%), depression (33.3 vs. 10.2%) and cognitive impairment (26.7 vs. 8.5%), while patients &lt;60 years of age had a higher prevalence of hallucinations, delirium and bizarre behavior. Psychiatric manifestations are an important part of the symptomatology of COVID-19, sometimes requiring hospitalization.

"Characteristics of 100 consecutive patients with COVID-19 referred to consultation-liaison psychiatry services in Qatar: A comparison of patients with delirium versus other psychiatric diagnoses","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with various neuropsychiatric manifestations. This study reports on patients with COVID-19 who were referred to the consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatry services in Qatar and compares the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of those diagnosed with delirium versus other psychiatric diagnoses. This is a retrospective review of the first 100 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were referred to the CL services. Within the total cohort (n=100), most patients (92%) were male, and the mean age was 46 years. About 27% of patients had asymptomatic COVID-19, 35% had a past psychiatric history, and 48% reported pandemic related psychosocial stress. Delirium was the most common psychiatric diagnosis (n=29), followed by acute stress reaction/adjustment disorder, depression, mania, anxiety, non-affective psychosis, and dementia. Among patients with delirium, agitation was the most common symptom (76%), 86% were treated with psychotropic medications, and 17% died. Higher age, longer hospital stays, lower oxygen saturation, lower lymphocytic count, and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) values were significantly associated with delirium versus other psychiatric diagnoses. Higher age and lower oxygen saturations predicted delirium. Delirium was associated with a range of clinical variables and had significant mortality, despite the relatively young age of the patients. COVID-19 should be considered in patients presenting with delirium.

This study examined changes in the number of overall and diagnosis-specific mental health ED visits among patients aged &lt;18 years following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Madrid, Spain. Using clinical records from all psychiatric ED visits at a major teaching hospital between October 2018 and April 2021, we conducted interrupted time-series analyses and compared trends before and after the day of the first ED COVID-19 case (1st March 2020). A total of 663 patients were included. In March 2020, there was a marked initial decrease of -12.8 (95% CI -21.9, - 7.9) less monthly mental health ED visits. After April 2020, there was a subsequent increasing trend of 3.4 (95% CI 2.6, 4.2) additional monthly mental health ED visits. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in paediatric psychiatric ED visits, especially due to suicide-related reasons.

"Social capital, food insecurity, and health outcomes in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this study was first, to investigate the harmful effects of food insufficiency on health outcomes - self-rated health (SRH) and self-assessed depressive symptoms - during the COVID-19 pandemic and, second, to test whether these effects fluctuated across the US in terms of state-level social capital. Data were drawn from the Census Household Pulse Survey (fielded between April 2020 and February 2021) consisting of community-dwelling American adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.5M+). Social capital measures were taken from the 'Social Capital Project' sponsored by the US Congress. We estimated three-level mixed effects models to analyze multiple waves of repeated cross-sectional surveys. Post-COVID-19 food insufficiency was significantly negatively associated with SRH and positively associated depression, adjusting for controls including food insufficiency prior to the onset of the pandemic. These relationships were also more pronounced in areas with higher aggregate social capital. The health burdens of the new coronavirus disease have fallen disproportionately on the economically marginalized, as measured by food insufficiency. Contrary to the conventional literature, living in a state with a greater stock of social capital worsened its health effects.","Choi, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1177/17579139221106339","20220715","health inequalities; inequalities; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34390,""
"Coronavirus disease pandemic and adolescent substance use","Substance use is common in adolescence and has distinct developmental, cognitive, and health consequences. Over the last 2 years, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has isolated adolescents, disrupted typical developmental milestones, and caused pervasive stress and anxiety. Healthcare providers can help by recognizing and addressing these effects on adolescent mental health and substance use. This update reviews the immediate effects of the pandemic on adolescent substance use, potential future implications, and opportunities to use new strategies to improve care for adolescents with problematic use. Initial findings suggest that fewer teens started using substances during the pandemic. This was likely influenced by stay at home orders that reduced opportunities for social use. However, increased time at home was not beneficial for all adolescents. Furthermore, adolescents who used substances prepandemic, experienced material hardship, or reported higher pandemic-related stress tended to intensify substance use during this time. The adverse effects of pandemic isolation, anxiety, and developmental disruption will likely have consequences for adolescent substance use for many years to come. To comprehensively address adolescent health, healthcare providers can be sensitive to these realities and use existing screening and brief intervention strategies to address use. Innovative telehealth strategies that allow for the expansion of substance use treatment offer promising opportunities to improve care for adolescents with substance use disorder.","Calihan, Levy","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOP.0000000000001125","20220715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34391,""
"Injury-Related Pediatric Emergency Department Visits in the First Year of COVID-19","To describe the epidemiology of pediatric injury-related visits to children's hospital emergency departments (EDs) in the United States (US) during early and later periods of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Pediatric Health Information System, an administrative database to identify injury-related ED visits at 41 US children's hospitals during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period (March 15, 2020 to March 14, 2021) and a 3-year comparator period (March 15-March 14, 2017-2020). For these two periods, we compared patient characteristics, injury type and severity, primary discharge diagnoses, and disposition, stratified by early (March 15, 2020 to June 30, 2020), middle (July 1, 2020 to Oct 31, 2020), and late (November 1, 2020 to March 14, 2021) pandemic periods. Overall, ED injury-related visits decreased by 26.6% during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with the largest decline observed in minor injuries.

"The impact of virtual learning on students' educational behavior and pervasiveness of depression among university students due to the COVID-19 pandemic","One of the worst pandemics of recent memory, COVID-19, severely impacted the public. In particular, students were physically and mentally affected by the lockdown and the shift from physical person-to-person classrooms to virtual learning (online classes). This increased the prevalence of psychological stress, anxiety, and depression among university students. In this study, we investigated the depression levels in Saudi Arabian university students who were learning virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic and examined its impact on their educational proficiency. The study focused on two points: first, examining the depression levels among undergraduate students in Saudi Arabia, by adapting the Zung (Self-Rating Depression Scale) questionnaire. Second, whether there is an association between the levels of depression and various distress factors associated with virtual (online) learning resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on students' educational behaviors. The questionnaire was prepared using a monkey survey and shared online, via email, and on WhatsApp groups, with participants in two universities, a public and private university in the largest city of Saudi Arabia. A total of 157 complete responses were received. Data were analyzed using SPSS-24, the chi-square test, descriptive statistics, and multilinear regression. The results indicated that three-fourths of the university students suffered from different depressive symptoms, half of which had moderate to extreme levels of depression. Our study confirmed that a boring virtual (online) learning method, stress, fear of examinations, and decreased productivity were significantly associated with increased depression. In addition, 75% and 79% of the students suffered from stress and fear of examinations, respectively. About half of theÃ‚Â students were associated with increased depression. The outcome also indicated that female students experienced extreme depression, stress, and fear of examinations more than males. These findings can inform government agencies and representatives of the importance of making swift, effective decisions to address students' depression levels. It is essential to provide training for students to change their educational experience mindset, which might help decrease ""depression and stress-related growth."" There is also a need to search for a better virtual teaching delivery method to lessen students' stress and fear of examinations.","Azmi, Khan, Azmi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-022-00863-z","20220714","COVID-19; Depression; Higher education; Quality education; SDG 4; Saudi Arabia; Stress; e-learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34393,""
"Depression, aging, and immunity: implications for COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity","The aging process can have detrimental effects on the immune system rendering the elderly more susceptible to infectious disease and less responsive to vaccination. Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been hypothesized to show characteristics of accelerated biological aging. This raises the possibility that depressed individuals will show some overlap with elderly populations with respect to their immune response to infection and vaccination. Here we provide an umbrella review of this literature in the context of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. On balance, the available data do indeed suggest that depression is a risk factor for both adverse outcomes following COVID-19 infection and for reduced COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity. We conclude that MDD (and other major psychiatric disorders) should be recognized as vulnerable populations that receive priority for vaccination along with other at-risk groups.","Ford, Savitz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-022-00288-7","20220714","Aging; Depression; Immunosenescence; Inflammaging; Psychiatric disorders; SARS CoV-2; Vaccine immunogenicity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34394,""
"The changing landscape of pharmaceutical alternatives to the unregulated drug supply during COVID-19","The dual COVID-19 and overdose emergencies amplified strain on healthcare systems tasked with responding to both. One downstream consequence of the pandemic in the USA and Canada was a surge in drug overdoses resulting from public health-restricted access to services and an increasingly toxic unregulated drug supply. This study aimed to describe changes implemented by programs prescribing pharmaceutical alternatives to the drug supply during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. An environmental scan used surveys and qualitative interviews with service providers across Canada to examine pharmaceutical alternative prescribing practices and programs before and during the pandemic. This study summarized the nature, frequency, and reasons for pandemic-driven service delivery changes using directed content analysis, counts, and thematic analysis. Eighty-two of the 103 participating sites reported 1193 unique changes in physical space (368), client protocols (347), program operations (342), ancillary services (127), and staffing (90). Four qualitative themes describing the reasons for these changes emerged, namely (1) decreasing risk of COVID-19 infection; (2) decreasing risk of overdose; (3) prioritizing acute care of COVID-19 patients; and (4) improving client access to treatment. While most changes were aimed at decreasing risk of COVID-19 infection, some were found to be at odds with the measures needed to combat the overdose crisis; others met dual objectives of decreased risk of both overdose and infection. Further research should examine which changes should be kept or reversed once COVID-19-related public health measures are lifted.","McCrae, Glegg, Goyer, Le Foll, Brar, Sutherland, Fairbairn","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00657-x","20220714","COVID-19 pandemic; Canada; Harm reduction; Injectable opioid agonist treatment; Safe supply; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34395,""
"Pseudoscience andÃ‚Â fraudulent products for COVID-19 management","As of now, the COVID-19 pandemic has become uncontrolled and is spreading widely throughout the world. Additionally, new variants of the mutated viral variants have been found in some countries that are more dangerous than the original strain. Even vaccines cannot produce complete protective immunity against the newer strains of SARS-CoV-2. Due to such a dreadful situation, lots of fear and depression have been created among the public. People are looking for the treatment of the disease at any cost and there is a race in the market to provide treatment and make money, whether it is effective or not! In such a condition, many fraud products, remedies, and myths have come into the market, which is falsely claimed to be effective for the disease and can harm the patients. Hence, FDA has banned such products and remedies. In this review, we have compiled all such fraudulent and pseudosciences identified for COVID-19. Currently, in the pandemic time, health agencies are approving the repurposed medicines based on the small-scale clinical data for emergency uses that become ineffective (most of the cases) after large randomized clinical studies. Proper vigilance strategies need to be defined by the regulatory agencies of the nation and routine awareness programs shall be arranged for educating the people and healthcare workers on routine updates.","Chavda, Sonak, Munshi, Dhamade","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-21967-4","20220714","COVID-19; Fraudulent product; Myth; Pseudoscience; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34396,""
"Development of a multiomics model for identification of predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity: a retrospective cohort study","COVID-19 is a multi-system disorder with high variability in clinical outcomes among patients who are admitted to hospital. Although some cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 are believed to be associated with severity, there are no early biomarkers that can reliably predict patients who are more likely to have adverse outcomes. Thus, it is crucial to discover predictive markers of serious complications. In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed samples from 455 participants with COVID-19 who had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result between April 14, 2020, and Dec 1, 2020 and who had visited one of three Mayo Clinic sites in the USA (Minnesota, Arizona, or Florida) in the same period. These participants were assigned to three subgroups depending on disease severity as defined by the WHO ordinal scale of clinical improvement (outpatient, severe, or critical). Our control cohort comprised of 182 anonymised age-matched and sex-matched plasma samples that were available from the Mayo Clinic Biorepository and banked before the COVID-19 pandemic. We did a deep profiling of circulatory cytokines and other proteins, lipids, and metabolites from both cohorts. Most patient samples were collected before, or around the time of, hospital admission, representing ideal samples for predictive biomarker discovery. We used proximity extension assays to quantify cytokines and circulatory proteins and tandem mass spectrometry to measure lipids and metabolites. Biomarker discovery was done by applying an AutoGluon-tabular classifier to a multiomics dataset, producing a stacked ensemble of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Global proteomics and glycoproteomics on a subset of patient samples with matched pre-COVID-19 plasma samples was also done. We quantified 1463 cytokines and circulatory proteins, along with 902 lipids and 1018 metabolites. By developing a machine-learning-based prediction model, a set of 102 biomarkers, which predicted severe and clinical COVID-19 outcomes better than the traditional set of cytokines, were discovered. These predictive biomarkers included several novel cytokines and other proteins, lipids, and metabolites. For example, altered amounts of C-type lectin domain family 6 member A (CLEC6A), ether phosphatidylethanolamine (P-18:1/18:1), and 2-hydroxydecanoate, as reported here, have not previously been associated with severity in COVID-19. Patient samples with matched pre-COVID-19 plasma samples showed similar trends in muti-omics signatures along with differences in glycoproteomics profile. A multiomic molecular signature in the plasma of patients with COVID-19 before being admitted to hospital can be exploited to predict a more severe course of disease. Machine learning approaches can be applied to highly complex and multidimensional profiling data to reveal novel signatures of clinical use. The absence of validation in an independent cohort remains a major limitation of the study.

"Financial hardship experienced by people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic","People with disabilities are poorer and more financially insecure than nondisabled people. While people with disabilities were adversely affected by the pandemic and were more likely to experience poverty prior to the pandemic, less is known about their experiences with financial hardship during the pandemic. The aim of this study was to explore the financial hardship of people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, including differences with nondisabled people and those based on people with disabilities' sociodemographics. We analyzed Household Pulse Survey data from 52,890 adults (18+) with disabilities and 391,532 nondisabled adults using complex samples descriptive statistics and binary logistic regressions. During the Delta and first Omicron waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, 52.0% of people with disabilities had difficulty paying usual household expenses. People with disabilities were 2.78 times more likely to experience financial hardship during the pandemic than nondisabled people. People with disabilities' most common sources of income/funds for spending needs included: regular income sources (66.7%); credit cards or loans (36.6%); money from savings or selling assets or possessions (31.5%); and borrowing from friends or family (22.0%). A significant proportion of adults with disabilities experienced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic, including at greater rates than nondisabled adults. Financial hardship can have long lasting impacts upon people with disabilities, including on their physical and mental health, well-being, and overall quality of life.","Friedman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2022.101359","20220714","COVID-19 pandemic; Financial hardship; People with disabilities; Poverty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","",34398,""
