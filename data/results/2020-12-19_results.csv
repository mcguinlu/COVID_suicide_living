"PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 as a high risk factor for suicide - Key to prevention","Summary Background. Rising rates of suicide, the most dreadful consequence of mental health effects elicited by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) are cause for grave concern. However, the exact association between mental health problems and suicide remains largely unknown in relation to COVID-19. Methods. To determine the impact of COVID-19 on suicide trajectory, we used an interrupted time-series design to analyze monthly suicides rates extracted from Japan's national database. We next used mixed-effects regression models to investigate the relationship between the nationwide suicide increase in August 2020 and psychiatric states of 4,348 individuals from an online survey performed immediately before (December 2019) and during (August 2020) the pandemic. Psychiatric states included depression, anxiety, and COVID-19-related PTSD, a form of severe event-related stress. FIndings. In Japan, suicides had gradually decreased before COVID-19 ({beta} = -0.7 x 10-3, t57 = -14.2, p = 8.6 x 10-46), but increased drastically after a state of emergency was declared in April 2020 ({beta} = 0.9 x10-2, t57 = 17.3, p = 2.3x10-67). We found that PTSD symptoms reliably predict COVID-19's impact on suicide rates ({beta} = 6.3 x 10-4, t3936 = 5.96, p = 2.7 x 10-9). In contrast, depression scores are a reliable indicator of stress vulnerability (i.e. future suicide increases, {beta} = 0.001, t3936 = 6.6, p = 4.5 x 10-11). Simulations revealed that a one-point reduction in PTSD score could decrease suicides by up to 3.1 per ten million people per month in Japan. Interpretation. PTSD symptoms may help to identify high-risk groups so as to increase efficacy of prevention policies. Funding.

"Prevalence of anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic: An updated meta-analysis of community-based studies","The unprecedented worldwide crisis caused by the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the restrictive public health measures enforced by some countries to slow down its transmission have severely threatened the physical and mental wellbeing of communities globally. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers independently searched for cross-sectional community-based studies published between December 1, 2019 and August 23, 2020, using PubMed, WoS, Embase, and other sources (e.g., grey literature, manual search). Of 3049 records retrieved, 43 studies were included. These studies yielded an estimated overall prevalence of anxiety of 25%, which varied significantly across the different tools used to measure anxiety. Consistently reported risk factors for the development of anxiety included initial or peak phase of the outbreak, female sex, younger age, marriage, social isolation, unemployment and student status, financial hardship, low educational level, insufficient knowledge of COVID-19, epidemiological or clinical risk of disease and some lifestyle and personality variables. As the overall global prevalence of anxiety disorders is estimated to be 7.3% normally, our results suggest that rates of anxiety in the general population could be more than 3 times higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest a substantial impact on mental health that should be targeted by individual and population-level strategies.","SantabÃƒÂ¡rbara, Lasheras, Lipnicki, Bueno-Notivol, Moreno, LÃƒÂ³pez-AntÃƒÂ³n, De la CÃƒÂ¡mara, Lobo, Gracia-GarcÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110207","20201218","Anxiety; COVID-19; Community-based studies; Meta-analysis; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8419,""
"Mental health consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak in Spain A longitudinal study of the alarm situation and return to the new normality","The objective is to conduct a longitudinal analysis of the effects of the pandemic and alarm situation on the mental health of the general population at three points in time: two weeks after beginning the confinement, after a month, and after two months, when the lockdown was lifted and the country returned to the new normality. The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Sanguino, AusÃƒÂ­n, Castellanos, MuÃƒÂ±oz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110219","20201218","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Depression; Longitudinal; Posttraumatic stress disease; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8420,""
"The impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on loneliness among older adults in Austria","To halt the spread of COVID-19, Austria implemented a 7-week 'lockdown' in March/April 2020. We assess whether the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). Three analyses were conducted: (i) a comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-17) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (ii) an assessment of the cross-sectional correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness (May 2020) and (iii) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes (March-June 2020) in loneliness (Corona panel). We found (i) increased loneliness in 2020 compared with previous years, (ii) a moderate positive association between the number of restriction measures older adults were affected from and their loneliness and (iii) that loneliness was higher during 'lockdown' compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. We found evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus no strong negative consequences for older adults' mental health are expected. Nonetheless, the effects on loneliness, and subsequent mental health issues, could be both more long-lasting and severe if future restriction measures are enacted repeatedly and/or over longer time periods.","Stolz, Mayerl, Freidl","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa238","20201218","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8421,""
"Health-related quality of life of the Vietnamese during the COVID-19 pandemic","Vietnam applied strict quarantine measures to mitigate the rapid transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus. Central questions were how the COVID-19 pandemic affected health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the Vietnamese general population, and whether there is any difference in HRQOL among people under different quarantine conditions. This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 April- 30 May 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in Vietnam. Data was collected via an online survey using Google survey tool. A convenient sampling approach was employed, with participants being sorted into three groups: people who were in government quarantine facilities; people who were under self-isolation at their own place; and the general population who did not need enforced quarantine. The Vietnamese EQ-5D-5L instrument was used to measure HRQOL. Differences in HRQOL among people of isolation groups and their socio-demographic characteristics were statistically tested. A final sample was made of 406 people, including 10 persons from government quarantine facilities, 57 persons under self-isolation at private places, and the rest were the general population. The mean EQ-VAS was reported the highest at 90.5 (SD: 7.98) among people in government quarantine facilities, followed by 88.54 (SD: 12.24) among general population and 86.54 (SD 13.69) among people in self-isolation group. The EQ-5D-5L value was reported the highest among general population at 0.95 (SD: 0.07), followed by 0.94 (SD: 0.12) among people in government quarantine facilities, and 0.93 (SD: 0.13) among people who did self-isolation. Overall, most people, at any level, reported having problems with anxiety and/or depression in all groups. While there have been some worries and debates on implementing strict quarantine measures can hinder people's quality of life, Vietnam showed an opposite tendency in people's HRQOL even under the highest level of enforcement in the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Vu, Tran, Hoang, Khuong, Hoang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244170","20201218","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8422,""

The prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was 27.43% (95% CI=25.01%-29.85%). Women who were worried about themselves or their babies being infected with COVID-19 (OR=2.562, 95%CI=1.670-3.929), and those who had delayed regular medical check-ups (OR=2.434, 95%CI=1.580-3.750) were at higher risk of depression. Compared to those living in central and western parts of China, women living in northern (OR=0.513, 95%CI=0.326-0.807) and southeastern parts of China (OR=0.626, 95%CI=0.463-0.846) were less likely to have depression.&quot; The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased likelihood of mental health problems among pregnant and postnatal women. Over a quarter of the pregnant and postpartum women in China suffered from depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative health impact of depression, preventive measures, regular mental health screening and medical check-ups are needed with the goal to reduce the risk of depression in this vulnerable population during a pandemic.","Bo, Yang, Chen, Zhang, Zhang, Li, Li, Cheung, Ng, Wu, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000904","20201218","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8423,""

"The Mental Health of Female Physicians and Nurses in Oman during the COVID-19 Pandemic","We sought to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on female doctors and nurses' mental health in Oman. We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 402 female doctors and nurses recruited from several health facilities in Oman. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and the Sleep Quality Scale to determine the prevalence rates of anxiety, stress, well-being, and sleep quality. A total of 231 (57.5%) Omanis and 171 (42.5%) non-Omanis participated in this study. Of the total 402 participants, 28.4% were physicians and 71.6% were nurses. One in four (27.9%) participants reported caring for COVID-19 patients. One in four (27.9%) had moderate to severe anxiety. A higher proportion of Omanis (32.0%) had moderate to severe anxiety than non-Omanis (22.2%). Six in 10 (60.7%) scored at or above the mean on the PSS-10. Doctors and nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients reported higher levels of stress than those who did not. Almost half (45.3%) of the participants scored 50% or less on the well-being scale. A higher proportion of Omanis and those who cared for COVID-19 cases scored Ã¢â€°Â¤ 50. Four in 10 (39.3%) had poor sleep quality; this was particularly prevalent among Omanis. A multiple regression analysis revealed that anxiety, stress, and well-being were significant predictors of poor sleep quality. The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant effect on the mental health of health care workers in Oman. In this study, nurses, Omanis, and frontline health care workers were the most impacted by the global health crisis. Urgent psychological, social, and administrative interventions and support should be implemented to mitigate mental health risks in these groups.","Khamis, Al Mahyijari, Al Lawati, Badahdah","https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2020.103","20201218","Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental Health; Nurses; Oman; Physicians; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8426,""
"COVID-19: A Psychosocial Perspective","The World Health Organization declares coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and The World Economic Forum argues that the COVID-19-induced global lockdown is the biggest psychological experiment. This study is an attempt to empirically evaluate the possible adverse psychosocial effects caused by COVID-19-related lockdown, if any. To do so, a cross-sectional study is conducted based on a comprehensive online survey using snowball sampling to analyze the level of social and psychological impacts (i.e., stress, belief in stakeholders, fear of losing job, and life satisfaction) during the early stage of the outbreak in Pakistan. The questionnaire is filled out by the residents in Pakistan including working professionals and students (sample size is 428). We find that the development of stress due to COVID-19-induced lockdown is particularly because of mood swings. Additionally, a higher prevalence of stress in the children of highly educated mothers is evident (95% confidence). To assess the belief in stakeholders, we focus gender, demographics, and education. It is observed that parental education and age significantly affect the belief in several stakeholders (i.e., government, media, religious clerics, and family). The lockdown-induced fear of losing job is lower in female and male children whose fathers are graduates. Lastly, we observe that food storage and &quot;no fear of losing job&quot; significantly increases the odds of life satisfaction. These findings have important implications in the context of social insurance, parental education, and policy related to COVID-19 at various levels. This study further facilitates to understand the factors that might affect the mental health and life satisfaction of people during such pandemics.","Raza, Haq, Sajjad","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.554624","20201218","COVID-19; psychology; public health; stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8427,""
"Evaluation of students' attitude and emotions towards the sudden closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Rapid increases in the number of COVID-19 cases have led to the closure of academic institutions including elementary and high schools. The absence from the educational environment can affect the students' emotions towards education and school attendance. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the students' attitude and emotions towards the sudden closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. By utilizing a modified version of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the students' positive and negative emotions towards schools during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questionnaires were filled by 20,697 participants with an average age of 13.76, and 70.3% of them were females. Also, 83.3% were from public schools and 80.6% from urban areas. Based on the questionnaire, for positive attitude a median of 31 (IQR 26-35) and for negative attitude a median of 25 (IQR 19-32) were obtained. Our findings demonstrated a satisfactory level of students' emotions regarding schools and education during the closure of schools and institutions. This indicates that despite the imposed situation, students showed enthusiasm towards learning and schools.","Mirahmadizadeh, Ranjbar, Shahriarirad, Erfani, Ghaem, Jafari, Rahimi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-020-00500-7","20201218","COVID-19; Education; Emotion; Schools; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8428,""
"&quot;We've got through hard times before: acute mental distress and coping among disadvantaged groups during COVID-19 lockdown in North India - a qualitative study&quot;","The COVID-19 crisis in India negatively impacted mental health due to both the disease and the harsh lockdown, yet there are almost no qualitative studies describing mental health impacts or the strategies of resilience used, and in particular, no reports from the most vulnerable groups. This study aimed to examine the acute mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis as well as coping strategies employed by disadvantaged community members in North India. We used an intersectional lens for this qualitative study set in rural Tehri Garwhal and urban Dehradun districts of Uttarakhand, India. In-depth interviews were conducted in May 2020 during lockdown, by phone and in person using purposive selection, with people with disabilities, people living in slums with psychosocial disabilities and widows (total nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°24). We used the framework method for analysis following steps of transcription and translation, familiarisation, coding, developing and then applying a framework, charting and then interpreting data. The participants with compounded disadvantage had almost no access to mobile phones, health messaging or health care and experienced extreme mental distress and despair, alongside hunger and loss of income. Under the realms of intrapersonal, interpersonal and social, six themes related to mental distress emerged: feeling overwhelmed and bewildered, feeling distressed and despairing, feeling socially isolated, increased events of othering and discrimination, and experiencing intersectional disadvantage. The six themes summarising coping strategies in the COVID-19 crisis were: finding sense and meaning, connecting with others, looking for positive ways forward, innovating with new practices, supporting others individually and collectively, and engaging with the natural world. People intersectionally disadvantaged by their social identity experienced high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 crisis, yet did not collapse, and instead described diverse and innovative strategies which enabled them to cope through the COVID-19 lockdown. This study illustrates that research using an intersectional lens is valuable to design equitable policy such as the need for access to digital resources, and that disaggregated data is needed to address social inequities at the intersection of poverty, disability, caste, religious discrimination and gender inherent in the COVID-19 pandemic in India.","Mathias, Rawat, Philip, Grills","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01345-7","20201218","COVID-19; Disability; Equity; India; Mental health; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8429,""
"The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-regression","Stress, anxiety, and depression are some of the most important research and practice challenges for psychologists, psychiatrists, and behavioral scientists. Due to the importance of issue and the lack of general statistics on these disorders among the Hospital staff treating the COVID-19 patients, this study aims to systematically review and determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. In this research work, the systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression approaches are used to approximate the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. The keywords of prevalence, anxiety, stress, depression, psychopathy, mental illness, mental disorder, doctor, physician, nurse, hospital staff, 2019-nCoV, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and Coronaviruses were used for searching the SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases. The search process was conducted in December 2019 to June 2020. In order to amalgamate and analyze the reported results within the collected studies, the random effects model is used. The heterogeneity of the studies is assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> index. Lastly, the data analysis is performed within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Of the 29 studies with a total sample size of 22,380, 21 papers have reported the prevalence of depression, 23 have reported the prevalence of anxiety, and 9 studies have reported the prevalence of stress. The prevalence of depression is 24.3% (18% CI 18.2-31.6%), the prevalence of anxiety is 25.8% (95% CI 20.5-31.9%), and the prevalence of stress is 45% (95% CI 24.3-67.5%) among the hospitals' Hospital staff caring for the COVID-19 patients. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, with increasing the sample size, the prevalence of depression and anxiety decreased, and this was statistically significant (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), however, the prevalence of stress increased with increasing the sample size, yet this was not statistically significant (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.829). The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is high. Therefore, the health policy-makers should take measures to control and prevent mental disorders in the Hospital staff.","Salari, Khazaie, Hosseinian-Far, Khaledi-Paveh, Kazeminia, Mohammadi, Shohaimi, Daneshkhah, Eskandari","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-00544-1","20201218","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8430,""
"Psychological disturbances of survivors throughout COVID-19 crisis: a qualitative study","In addition to physical problems, patients with COVID-19 suffer from considerable stress throughout the disease crisis. It is important to address mental health needs and not to ignore the psychological dimension in this group of patients. In this regard, the first practical step is to have a clear understanding of patients' psychological issues. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis. This qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach through 14 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients recovered from COVID-19. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. Three themes of &quot;living in limbo&quot;, &quot;psychological distress behind the wall&quot; and &quot;psychological burden of being a carrier&quot; were extracted as the psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis. This study portrayed a better understanding of psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis based on their lived experiences. Given the ambiguity in the time of the disease eradication and its continuing course, a deep understanding of these experiences in the current critical situation can help healthcare officials to make appropriate decisions and take measures to assess and identify psychological traumas and perform interventions to improve the mental state of these patients.","Moradi, Mollazadeh, Karimi, Hosseingholipour, Baghaei","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03009-w","20201218","COVID-19; Phenomenology; Psychological disturbances; Qualitative research; Survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8431,""
"Health Care Crisis Unabated: A Review of Recent Data on Health Care in the United States","We review recently published studies of U.S. health policy and the nation's health care system. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, health inequalities were widening and care was inequitably distributed. Although the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion improved access to care and timely cancer diagnoses, a large proportion of U.S. residents continued to avoid medical care due to concerns about costs, and access to mental health services remains particularly inadequate. Yet more evidence of private insurers' profit-driven misbehaviors and of corruption among medical leaders continues to emerge. Misguided incentives and lax regulation encourages nominally nonprofit health care providers to mimic for-profits' misconduct, and rapacious investors own and control an increasing share of physicians' practices. Pharmaceutical firms wield outsize political influence and devote far more funds to rewarding investors than to research and development effort. Yet despite vigorous efforts by pharma and other commercial interests to denigrate national health insurance, polls indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increasing support for such reform.","Himmelstein, Woolhandler","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420981497","20201218","access to care; health care costs; health insurance; health policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8432,""

"COVID-Well: Evaluation of the Implementation of Supported Wellbeing Centres for Hospital Employees during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Supported Wellbeing Centres have been set up in UK hospital trusts in an effort to mitigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers, although the extent to which these are utilised and the barriers and facilitators to access are not known. The aim of the study was to determine facility usage and gather insight into employee wellbeing and the views of employees towards this provision. The study included (i) 17-week service use monitoring, (ii) employee online survey with measures of wellbeing, job stressfulness, presenteeism, turnover intentions, job satisfaction, and work engagement, as well as barriers and facilitators to accessing the Wellbeing Centres. Over 17 weeks, 14,934 facility visits were recorded across two sites (peak attendance in single week <i>n</i> = 2605). Facilities were highly valued, but the service model was resource intensive with 134 wellbeing buddies supporting the centres in pairs. 819 hospital employees completed an online survey (88% female; 37.7% working in COVID-19 high risk areas; 52.4% frontline workers; 55.2% had accessed a wellbeing centre). There was moderate-to-high job stress (62.9%), low wellbeing (26.1%), presenteeism (68%), and intentions to leave (31.6%). Wellbeing was higher in those that accessed a wellbeing centre. Work engagement and job satisfaction were high. Healthcare organisations are urged to mobilise access to high-quality rest spaces and psychological first aid, but this should be localised and diversified. Strategies to address presenteeism and staff retention should be prioritised, and the high dedication of healthcare workers should be recognised.","Blake, Yildirim, Wood, Knowles, Mancini, Coyne, Cooper","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249401","20201218","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; psychological wellbeing; wellbeing centres; wobble rooms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-19","",8434,""
