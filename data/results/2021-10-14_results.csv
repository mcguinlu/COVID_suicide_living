"[COVID-19 as a syndemic: a theoretical model and foundations for a comprehensive approach in health]","This essay aims to present and discuss the theoretical framework for the COVID-19 syndemic. The first part presents the foundations and principles of syndemic theory. For the purposes of this essay, syndemic was defined as a process of synergic interaction between two or more diseases, in which the effects are mutually enhanced. We discussed the three principal typologies of syndemic interaction: mutually causal epidemics; epidemics interacting synergically; and serial causal epidemics. In the second part, COVID-19 is analyzed as a syndemic resulting from the interaction between various groups of diseases and the socioeconomic context. The theoretical model considered the interaction between COVID-19 and chronic noncommunicable diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, and mental health problems. The essay addressed how social iniquities and conditions of vulnerability act at various levels to increase the effect of COVID-19 and other pandemics. The last section discusses the need for comprehensive, multisector, and integrated responses to COVID-19. A model for intervention was presented that involves the patient care and socioeconomic dimensions. In the sphere of patient care, the authors defend the structuring of strong and responsive health systems, accessible to the entire population. The economic and social dimension addressed the issue of reclaiming the ideals of solidarity, the health promotion strategy, and emphasis on social determinants of health. In conclusion, the lessons learned from the syndemic approach to COVID-19 call on government and society to develop policies that link clinical, sanitary, socioeconomic, and environmental interventions. Este ensaio tem como objetivo apresentar e discutir o quadro teÃƒÂ³rico da sindemia da COVID-19. Na primeira parte, sÃƒÂ£o apresentados os fundamentos e princÃƒÂ­pios da teoria sindÃƒÂªmica. Adotou-se o conceito de sindemia como processo de interaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o sinÃƒÂ©rgica entre duas ou mais doenÃƒÂ§as, no qual os efeitos se potencializam mutuamente. Foram discutidas as trÃƒÂªs principais tipologias de interaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o sindÃƒÂªmica: epidemias mutuamente causais; epidemias interagindo sinergicamente; e epidemias causais em sÃƒÂ©rie. Na segunda parte, a COVID-19 ÃƒÂ© analisada como uma sindemia resultante da interaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o entre vÃƒÂ¡rios grupos de doenÃƒÂ§as e o contexto socioeconÃƒÂ´mico. O modelo teÃƒÂ³rico considerou a interaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o entre COVID-19 e doenÃƒÂ§as crÃƒÂ´nicas nÃƒÂ£o transmissÃƒÂ­veis, doenÃƒÂ§as infecciosas e parasitÃƒÂ¡rias e problemas de saÃƒÂºde mental. Abordou-se como as iniquidades sociais e as condiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes de vulnerabilidade atuam em diversos nÃƒÂ­veis e potencializam a atuaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o da COVID-19 e das demais pandemias. Na ÃƒÂºltima seÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o, discute-se a necessidade de respostas abrangentes, multisetoriais e integradas ao enfrentamento da COVID-19. Foi apresentado um modelo de intervenÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o envolvendo as dimensÃƒÂµes assistencial e socioeconÃƒÂ´mica. No ÃƒÂ¢mbito assistencial, defendeu-se a estruturaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de sistemas de saÃƒÂºde fortes, responsivos e acessÃƒÂ­veis a toda a populaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o. A dimensÃƒÂ£o econÃƒÂ´mica e social abordou o resgate dos ideais de solidariedade, da estratÃƒÂ©gia da promoÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o da saÃƒÂºde e a ÃƒÂªnfase sobre os determinantes sociais. Conclui-se que as liÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes aprendidas com a abordagem sindÃƒÂªmica da COVID-19 exortam governos e a sociedade para o desenvolvimento de polÃƒÂ­ticas que articulem intervenÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes clÃƒÂ­nicas, sanitÃƒÂ¡rias, socioeconÃƒÂ´micas e ambientais.

Se concluye que las lecciones aprendidas con el abordaje sindÃƒÂ©mico de la COVID-19 exhortan a gobiernos y sociedad a que desarrollen polÃƒÂ­ticas que implementen y coordinen intervenciones clÃƒÂ­nicas, sanitarias, socioeconÃƒÂ³micas y ambientales.","Bispo JÃƒÂºnior, Santos","https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311X00119021","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18785,""
"Chronicling moral distress among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal analysis of mental health strain, burnout, and maladaptive coping behaviours","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented many novel situations that have amplified the presence of moral distress in healthcare. With limited resources to protect themselves against the virus and strict safety regulations that alter the way they work, healthcare providers have felt forced to engage in work behaviours that conflicted with their professional and personal sense of right and wrong. Although many providers have experienced moral distress while being physically in the workplace, others suffered while at home. Some healthcare providers worked in facilities that were unable to open during the pandemic due to restrictions, which could contribute to a sense of powerlessness and guilt. The current study assessed whether the ability to see patients each week impacted the relationship between an employee's moral distress and their mental health strain, burnout, and maladaptive coping. A total of 378 healthcare providers responded to weekly surveys over the course of 7Ã‚Â months (April 2020-December 2020). Hierarchical linear modeling techniques were used to examine the study variables over time. Results showed that moral distress predicted an individual's mental health strain and burnout, even after controlling for the prior week. However, moral distress was not a significant predictor of maladaptive coping. Interestingly, there was not a significant difference between the average ratings of moral distress between those who were able, and those who were not able to see patients, meaning that both groups experienced symptoms of moral distress. However, cross-level moderation results indicated that the ability to see patients magnified the relationships between moral distress and mental health strain and burnout over time. Implications of the results and recommendations for how moral distress should be addressed among healthcare providers are discussed.","Wilson, Metwally, Heavner, Kennedy, Britt","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12942","20211013","COVID-19; burnout; maladaptive coping; mental health strain; moral distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18786,""
"Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in Brazilian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Predictors and association with life satisfaction, psychological well-being and coping strategies","The COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about the mental health of the world population. Protection measures to prevention the disease impacted education and undergraduate students were exposed to additional stressors. Analyze depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in undergraduates, their respective predictors and the association with satisfaction with life, psychological well-being and coping strategies. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from September 14 to October 19, 2020, involving undergraduate students enrolled in 33 courses from 5 public university campuses in the state of Parana, Brazil, using: questionnaire with sociodemographic, academic, health and pandemic effects variables; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21); Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS); Psychological Well-Being (PWB); BriefCOPE. The convenience sample was composed of 1,224 participants, with 18 years old or older, that completed all research instruments. Spearman correlation and logistic analysis (univariate and multivariate) were applied to the collected data. Most of the undergraduates presented symptoms of depression (60.5%), anxiety (52.5%) and stress (57.5%). Depression, anxiety and stress presented significant correlations in common: negative with satisfaction with life, all dimensions of psychological well-being, and 3 adaptive copings (active coping, planning, positive reframing); positive with 5 maladaptive copings (behavioral disengagement, denial, self-blame, self-distraction, substance use). In addition, there were 7 common predictors for symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress: female; age 18-24 years old; having a chronic disease; lower scores in 2 dimensions of psychological well-being (positive relations with others, self-acceptance); higher scores in 2 maladaptive copings (self-blame, substance use). The data indicate a high prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and suggest that higher scores of satisfaction with life, psychological well-being dimensions and adaptive copings may present protective effects in undergraduates during a pandemic crisis.","Lopes, Nihei","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258493","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18787,""
"Connection, constraint, and coping: A qualitative study of experiences of loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated physical distancing which is expected to continue in some form for the foreseeable future. Physical distancing policies have increased reliance on digital forms of social connection and there are widespread concerns about social isolation and mental health in this context. This qualitative study sought to understand how loneliness was experienced during physical distancing in the initial national UK COVID-19 lockdown. Eight individuals who reported feeling lonely during the initial lockdown were interviewed in May 2020. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: (1) Loss of in-person interaction causing loneliness, (2) Constrained freedom, (3) Challenging emotions, and (4) Coping with loneliness. The loss of in-person interaction contributed to feelings of loneliness and digital interaction was viewed as an insufficient alternative. Social freedom could be constrained by distancing policies and by social contacts, contributing to strained personal relationships and feelings of frustration as part of loneliness. Fluctuations in mood and difficult emotions were experienced alongside loneliness, and distraction and seeking reconnection were commonly reported methods of coping, although they were less accessible. These findings indicate that physical distancing measures can impact loneliness due to the limitations they impose on in-person social contact and the perceived insufficiency of digital contact as a substitute.","McKenna-Plumley, Graham-Wisener, Berry, Groarke","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258344","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18788,""
"Lifestyle behaviors trend and their relationship with fear level of COVID-19: Cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia","COVID-19 pandemic cautionary measures have affected the daily life of people around the globe. Further, understanding the complete lifestyle behaviors profile can help healthcare providers in designing effective interventions and assessing overall health impact on risk of disease development. Thus, this study aims to assess the complete spectrum of lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, distress, social support, dietary habits, and smoking) prevalence and its association with fear of COVID-19 in people living in Saudi Arabia. Self-administered survey consisted of seven sections was used to collect data on fear of COVID-19 using Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), physical activity and sedentary behavior using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), psychosocial distress using Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), social support using the MOS social support survey, and dietary habits using a short version of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The online survey was distributed via social media platforms during lockdown period of COVID-19 pandemic (May-June 2020). Each section consisted of validated questionnaire examining one of aforementioned lifestyle behaviors. Associations were analyzed using multiple linear regression. A total of 669 individuals attempted to complete the online survey, 554 participants completed at least 2 sections of the survey (82.8%), and 41.3% (n = 276) completed the whole online survey. The majority of the sample were female (83%), not smokers (86.5%), had sufficient sleep duration (7.5 hrs Ã‚Â± 2.1), and only indicated mild level of distress (21.4 Ã‚Â± 8.9); they also reported high level of sedentary behavior (7.7 hrs Ã‚Â± 4.5), poor sleep quality (5.4 Ã‚Â± 2.4), were not engaged in healthy eating habits, and moderate level of perceived social support (62.0% Ã‚Â± 27). Only physical activity results indicated that about half of the sample were engaged in moderate to vigorous level of physical activity (54.3%). Further, being female (ÃŽÂ² = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.45, 2.94) and married (ÃŽÂ² = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.3, 2.63) were associated with fear of COVID-19 level (ÃŽÂ² = 0.21; 95% IC: 0.05, 0.19) with a confidence interval level of 95%. In addition, distress was associated with fear. The trend of lifestyle behaviors measured during lockdown period changed from previously published rates. Future research needs to establish the short-term and long-term effect of lifestyle behaviors complete profile on physical and mental health.","Alothman, Alghannam, Almasud, Altalhi, Al-Hazzaa","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257904","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18789,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health Nurses","The aim of this research was to assess the psychological effects of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on mental health nurses. An internet-based questionnaire that included the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Score (SAS) was used to assess the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of mental health nurses in an Irish mental health service. Among the nurses surveyed (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°161), 12% of the participants had an overall IES-R score from 24 to 32 indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was a clinical concern, while 38% had an overall IES-R score &gt;32 indicating that PTSD was a probable diagnosis. The mean SAS score that had been converted to anxiety index scores was 40.78 (SD = 9.25). The results showed that 30% of mental health nurses experienced anxiety levels from moderate to extreme. Overall findings confirm that mental health nurses are experiencing psychological distress as a result of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses who were &lt;30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age or who were in their current roles for less than a year or were ward-based and worked full-time, were most likely to be affected. Working during COVID-19 has not been routine work practice and for a cohort of workers who are already under pressure, the sacrifice in terms of general well-being has been immense. The offer of individualized psychological support for mental health nurses working during the pandemic should be both practical in nature and flexible enough to meet individual needs.","King, Farrington, Donohue, McCann","https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2021.1978598","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18790,""
"Refractory Shock from Amlodipine Overdose Overcomed with Hyperinsulinemia","Intoxication from calcium channel blockers exhibits almost 50% mortality rates. Amlodipine is a long-acting dihydropyridine and inappropriate dosage poses a great threat for profound vasodilation, hypotension, and refractory vasopressor-resistant shock. A 72-year-old woman with unremarkable medical history presented to the emergency department due to amlodipine overdose after a suicide attempt attributed to COVID-19 pandemic severe anxiety disorder. Vital signs at presentation: heart rate 82 beats/ min, arterial pressure 72/55Ã‚Â mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98%. Resuscitation was initiated with intravenous infusion of normal saline 0,9%, noradrenaline, and calcium chloride, while activated charcoal was orally administrated; however, blood pressure remained at 70/45Ã‚Â mmHg. Abruptly, she experienced acute pulmonary edema and was finally intubated. We commenced high-dose insulin infusion with Dextrose 10% infusion to maintain euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Hemodynamic improvement occurred after 30Ã‚Â min, systolic blood pressure raised to 95Ã‚Â mmHg, and decongestion was achieved with intravenous furosemide. Insulin effect was dose-dependent and patient's hemodynamic status improved after insulin uptitration. Eight days later, the patient was weaned from the mechanical ventilation and she was successfully discharged after 14Ã‚Â days. High-dose intravenous infusion of insulin up to 10 units/kg per hour appears as an inotropic agent possibly through alterations in myocardial metabolism of fatty acids and augmentation of insulin secretion and uptake. This regimen possibly exhibits additional vasotropic properties. We conclude that euglycemic hyperinsulinemia is a potentially advantageous treatment in CCB toxicity.","Koliastasis, Lampadakis, Milkas, Strempelas, Sourides, Kakava, Tsioufis, Papaioannou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12012-021-09699-2","20211013","Amlodipine; Calcium channel blocker; Hyperinsulinemia; Insulin; Overdose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18791,""
"Prevalence of Depression Symptoms Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Two Asian American Ethnic Groups","Asian Americans have experienced compounding stressors during the pandemic as a result of racial discrimination. We aim of to investigate the prevalence of depression symptoms among Asian Americans before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine differences based on socio-demographic factors. Data are from a cross-sectional study (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°636) among Chinese and South Asian adults in Chicago collected between February and May 2020. One cohort of participants were surveyed from each ethnic group before the pandemic and a second cohort of participants were surveyed during the pandemic. Depression symptoms increased more than two-fold, from 9% pre-pandemic to 21% during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found an increase in depression symptoms during the pandemic for South Asians, men and adults older than 30Ã‚Â years. These findings call for public health education that effectively addresses anti-Asian harassment and violence and ensure that culturally competent mental health services are provided to Asian Americans from diverse ethnic backgrounds.","Lozano, Rueger, Lam, Louie, Southworth, Maene, Mo, Randal, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10903-021-01287-4","20211013","Asian Americans; COVID-19; Depression symptoms; Discrimination; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18792,""
"Children and Adolescents with Disabilities and Exposure to Disasters, Terrorism, and the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Scoping Review","This paper reviews the empirical literature on exposures to disaster or terrorism and their impacts on the health and well-being of children with disabilities and their families since the last published update in 2017. We also review the literature on studies examining the mental health and functioning of children with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies have examined the effects of disaster or terrorism on children with disabilities. Research shows that children with disabilities and their families have higher levels of disaster exposure, lower levels of disaster preparedness, and less recovery support due to longstanding discriminatory practices. Similarly, many reports of the COVID-19 pandemic have documented its negative and disproportionate impacts on children with disabilities and their families. In the setting of climate change, environmental disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity. Future studies identifying mitigating factors to disasters, including COVID-19; increasing preparedness on an individual, community, and global level; and evaluating post-disaster trauma-informed treatment practices are imperative to support the health and well-being of children with disabilities and their families.","Mann, McMillan, Silver, Stein","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01295-z","20211013","COVID-19; Children; Disabilities; Disaster; Mental health; Pandemic; Terrorism; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18793,""
"The impact of COVID-19-related distress on levels of depression, anxiety and quality of life in psychogeriatric patients","Within the elderly population, psychogeriatric patients may be particularly susceptible to negative mental health effects of the coronavirus crisis. Detailed information about the psychosocial well-being of psychogeriatric patients during the pandemic is still sparse. Here we examined which aspects of subjective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic especially affect levels of depression, anxiety and quality of life in psychogeriatric patients with and without cognitive impairment. A cross-sectional paper survey was conducted during the first German lockdown among patients with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 60 years) or a diagnosed neurodegenerative disease (regardless of their age) from the department for neurodegenerative diseases and geriatric psychiatry at the University of Bonn. The WHO-5-, GAD-7- and WHOQOL-old score were used to determine levels of depression, anxiety and quality of life. The second part obtained information about the subjective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistical analysis included among others principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. COVID-19-related, immediate distress was a strong predictor of elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety and a reduced quality of life. COVID-19-related concerns regarding health and financial security, however, were not significantly associated with negative mental health outcomes. The overall prevalence of symptoms of depression (50.8% [95% CI 43.8-57.6%]) and anxiety (32.7% [95% CI 26.4-39.2%]) among psychogeriatric patients was high. Our findings indicate that psychogeriatric patients are not significantly affected by COVID-19-related concerns but are primarily suffering from emotional consequences resulting from changed living conditions due to the pandemic.","Miklitz, Westerteicher, Lippold, Ochs, Schneider, Fliessbach","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-021-01340-1","20211013","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychogeriatric patients; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18794,""
"Short-term and Long-term Rates of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review","Short-term and long-term persistent postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) have not been systematically evaluated. The incidence and evolution of PASC are dependent on time from infection, organ systems and tissue affected, vaccination status, variant of the virus, and geographic region. To estimate organ system-specific frequency and evolution of PASC. PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, the World Health Organization Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and CoronaCentral databases were searched from December 2019 through March 2021. A total of 2100 studies were identified from databases and through cited references. Studies providing data on PASC in children and adults were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for abstracting data were followed and performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. The main outcome was frequency of PASC diagnosed by (1) laboratory investigation, (2) radiologic pathology, and (3) clinical signs and symptoms. PASC were classified by organ system, ie, neurologic; cardiovascular; respiratory; digestive; dermatologic; and ear, nose, and throat as well as mental health, constitutional symptoms, and functional mobility. From a total of 2100 studies identified, 57 studies with 250Ã¢â‚¬Â¯351 survivors of COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age of survivors was 54.4 (8.9) years, 140Ã¢â‚¬Â¯196 (56%) were male, and 197Ã¢â‚¬Â¯777 (79%) were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. High-income countries contributed 45 studies (79%). The median (IQR) proportion of COVID-19 survivors experiencing at least 1 PASC was 54.0% (45.0%-69.0%; 13 studies) at 1 month (short-term), 55.0% (34.8%-65.5%; 38 studies) at 2 to 5 months (intermediate-term), and 54.0% (31.0%-67.0%; 9 studies) at 6 or more months (long-term). Most prevalent pulmonary sequelae, neurologic disorders, mental health disorders, functional mobility impairments, and general and constitutional symptoms were chest imaging abnormality (median [IQR], 62.2% [45.8%-76.5%]), difficulty concentrating (median [IQR], 23.8% [20.4%-25.9%]), generalized anxiety disorder (median [IQR], 29.6% [14.0%-44.0%]), general functional impairments (median [IQR], 44.0% [23.4%-62.6%]), and fatigue or muscle weakness (median [IQR], 37.5% [25.4%-54.5%]), respectively. Other frequently reported symptoms included cardiac, dermatologic, digestive, and ear, nose, and throat disorders. In this systematic review, more than half of COVID-19 survivors experienced PASC 6 months after recovery. The most common PASC involved functional mobility impairments, pulmonary abnormalities, and mental health disorders. These long-term PASC effects occur on a scale that could overwhelm existing health care capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.","Groff, Sun, Ssentongo, Ba, Parsons, Poudel, Lekoubou, Oh, Ericson, Ssentongo, Chinchilli","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.28568","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18795,""
"Childhood Cancer Survivors and Distance Education Challenges: Lessons Learned From the COVID-19 Pandemic","Pediatric cancer survivors have historically struggled to receive adequate educational supports. In Spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced an emergency switch from traditional in-person education models to distance education, but little information is available regarding experiences of pediatric survivors' coping with schooling since that time. This article presents exploratory mixed methods findings from a quality improvement project including qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey conducted with parents of pediatric oncology survivors identified through neuropsychological assessment, and the use of school-based services as having educationally relevant neurocognitive impacts of disease or treatment. The interviews explored experiences of education and instructional delivery during the COVID-19 school closures in spring of 2020 and the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year and served as the foundation for a quantitative survey to determine the generalizability of findings. Qualitative interviews highlighted 3 emergent themes regarding the shared experiences of distance schooling for children with cancer during the COVID-19 school closures: (a) attention, (b) mental health, and (c) access to instruction. A follow-up quantitative survey supported the qualitative findings and their generalizability to the schooling experiences of other children with cancer during the pandemic. This article describes and explores each theme and offers suggestions for pediatric supports and changes to provider service delivery (including weblinks to access project-developed resources) as a result of ongoing pandemic-related schooling needs.","Carey, Ruble, ParÃƒÂ©-Blagoev, Milla, Thornton, Henegan, Jacobson","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab103","20211013","neurocognitive/executive functioning; oncology; school functioning; school-age children; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18796,""
"Building the Digital Mental Health Ecosystem: Opportunities and Challenges for Mobile Health Innovators","Digital mental health technologies such as mobile health (mHealth) tools can offer innovative ways to help develop and facilitate mental health care provision, with the COVID-19 pandemic acting as a pivot point for digital health implementation. This viewpoint offers an overview of the opportunities and challenges mHealth innovators must navigate to create an integrated digital ecosystem for mental health care moving forward. Opportunities exist for innovators to develop tools that can collect a vast range of active and passive patient and transdiagnostic symptom data. Moving away from a symptom-count approach to a transdiagnostic view of psychopathology has the potential to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis, and can further enable personalized treatment strategies. However, the uptake of these technologies critically depends on the perceived relevance and engagement of end users. To this end, behavior theories and codesigning approaches offer opportunities to identify behavioral drivers and address barriers to uptake, while ensuring that products meet users' needs and preferences. The agenda for innovators should also include building strong evidence-based cases for digital mental health, moving away from a one-size-fits-all well-being approach to embrace the development of comprehensive digital diagnostics and validated digital tools. In particular, innovators have the opportunity to make their clinical evaluations more insightful by assessing effectiveness and feasibility in the intended context of use. Finally, innovators should adhere to standardized evaluation frameworks introduced by regulators and health care providers, as this can facilitate transparency and guide health care professionals toward clinically safe and effective technologies. By laying these foundations, digital services can become integrated into clinical practice, thus facilitating deeper technology-enabled changes.","Spadaro, Martin-Key, Bahn","https://doi.org/10.2196/27507","20211013","digital implementation; digital mental health; digital psychiatry; digital technology; viewpoint","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18797,""
"Mental health and psychological resilience among acne vulgaris patients during the pandemic: A cross-sectional controlled study","Background The current literature has not yet addressed mental health among acne vulgaris (AV) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to investigate the psychological status of AV patients and analyze the influencing factors on psychological symptoms, during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study included consecutively selected 220 eligible AV patients and 190 age/sex-matched healthy subjects. The Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist for DSM-5, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, Brief Resilience Scale, and the Stressful Life Events List resulting from the pandemic were administered to the participants. There were not significantly differences between the AV patients and the control group in terms of depression, anxiety, stress, psychological resilience levels, and experienced stressful life events. Probable PTSD rate was significantly higher for AV patients (16.4%) than the control groups (9.5%) (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.040). High levels of depression and anxiety, low psychological resilience, and high levels in experienced traumatic life events predicted high severity in PTSD symptoms, whereas low psychological resilience predicted high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in AV patients. AV patients are at high risk of developing PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic. The obtained results highlight the need to assess their psychological state, in particular those with low psychological resilience.","Sagaltici, Tas","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14531","20211013","COVID-19; PTSD; acne vulgaris; anxiety; depression; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18798,""
"COVID-19 in children: I Epidemiology, prevention and indirect impacts","Children globally have been profoundly impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review explores the direct and indirect public health impacts of COVID-19 on children. We discuss in detail the transmission dynamics, vaccination strategies and, importantly, the 'shadow pandemic', encompassing underappreciated indirect impacts of the pandemic on children. The indirect effects of COVID-19 will have a long-term impact beyond the immediate pandemic period. These include the mental health and wellbeing risks, disruption to family income and attendant stressors including increased family violence, delayed medical attention and the critical issue of prolonged loss of face-to-face learning in a normal school environment. Amplification of existing inequities and creation of new disadvantage are likely additional sequelae, with children from vulnerable families disproportionately affected. We emphasise the responsibility of paediatricians to advocate on behalf of this vulnerable group to ensure the longer-term effects of COVID-19 public health responses on the health and wellbeing of children are fully considered.","Howard-Jones, Bowen, Danchin, Koirala, Sharma, Yeoh, Burgner, Crawford, Goeman, Gray, Hsu, Kuek, McMullan, Tosif, Wurzel, Britton","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15791","20211013","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; educational impact; school-based transmission; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18799,""
"Impact of varying wave periods of COVID-19 on in-hospital mortality and length of stay for admission through emergency department: A territory-wide observational cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with excess mortality and reduced emergency department attendance. However, the effect of varying wave periods of COVID-19 on in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for non-COVID disease for non-COVID diseases remains unexplored. We examined a territory-wide observational cohort of 563,680 emergency admissions between January 1 and November 30, 2020, and 709,583 emergency admissions during the same 2019 period in Hong Kong, China. Differences in 28-day in-hospital mortality risk and LOS due to COVID-19 were evaluated. The cumulative incidence of 28-day in-hospital mortality increased overall from 2.9% in 2019 to 3.6% in 2020 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.22, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.25). The aHR was higher among patients with lower respiratory tract infection (aHR: 1.30 95% CI 1.26 to 1.34), airway disease (aHR: 1.35 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49), and mental disorders (aHR: 1.26 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37). Mortality risk in the first- and third-wave periods was significantly greater than that in the inter-wave period (p-interactionÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The overall average LOS in the pandemic year was significantly shorter than that in 2019 (Mean differenceÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.40Ã¢â‚¬â€°days; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.36). Patients with mental disorders and cerebrovascular disease in 2020 had a 3.91-day and 2.78-day shorter LOS than those in 2019, respectively. Increased risk of in-hospital deaths was observed overall and by all major subgroups of disease during the pandemic period.

"Commentary on the special issue on disproportionate adversity: Trauma, stress, and adversities and health disparities among disenfranchised groups globally during the COVID pandemic","The papers in this Journal of Traumatic Stress special issue on disproportionate adversity cover the gamut of discrimination traumas and stressors, including microaggressions, a more insidious forms of discrimination, and their often-devastating and wide-ranging mental health sequelae, in disproportionately affected disenfranchised groups. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation commonly confers cumulative and chronic effects. In the field of traumatic stress studies, several types of identity-linked traumatic events have been identified and empirically investigated as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-producing experiences. Collectively, the 13 papers included in this special issue raise questions about the definition, conceptualization, and categorization of various forms of explicit and implicit identity-linked trauma. These papers highlight the need for acceptance of a shared nomenclature and better differentiation of both causal and correlational associations with acute and chronic PTSD, depression, suicide risk, alcohol misuse, and other mental health outcomes. In this commentary, the discussion is extended to COVID-19, a disease that has been globally devastating for many. On multiple levels (i.e., physical, mental, emotional, economic, and social), COVID-19 has magnified the prepandemic fault lines of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Applying a syndemic framework to the health impact of COVID-19 and, arguably, the most pervasive identity linked epidemic worldwide-systemic racism-brings perspective to the biological and social forces that are likely to be driving the convergence of COVID-19, systemic racism, and chronic health inequities, and may be informative in guiding evidence-based strategies for managing racial trauma in the context of COVID-19.","Seedat","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22746","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18801,""
"Cognitive, behavioral, and psychological manifestations of COVID-19 in post-acute rehabilitation setting: preliminary data of an observational study","Psychological, emotional, and behavioral domains could be altered in COVID-19 patients and measurement of variables within these domains seems to be mandatory. Neuropsychological assessment could detect possible cognitive impairment caused by COVID-19 and the choice of appropriate tools is an important question. Aim of this exploratory study was to verify the effectiveness of an assessment model for patients with COVID-19. Twelve patients were enrolled and tested with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Anxiety and Depression Short Scale (AD-R), and the Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI), at the time of their entrance (T0) and discharge (T1) from a rehabilitative unit. Moreover, a follow-up evaluation after 3Ã‚Â months (T2) has been conducted on eight patients. Results showed that at baseline (T0), 58.3% of the patients reported a score below cut-off at MMSE and 50% at MoCA. Although a significant amelioration was found only in NPI scores, a qualitative improvement has been detected at all tests, except for MoCA scores, in the T0-T1 trend analysis. A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significant variation in AD-R depression score, considering the three-assessment time (T0, T1, and T2). The evaluation and tracking over time of the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive, psychological, and behavioral domains has relevant implications for rehabilitation and long-term assistance needs planning. The choice of assessment tools should consider patients vulnerability and match the best compromise among briefness, sensitivity, and specificity.","Bonizzato, Ghiggia, Ferraro, Galante","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05653-w","20211013","Behavioral alterations; COVID-19; Neuropsychological deficit; Psychological assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18802,""
"Mental health impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare workers in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: a multi-country study","Healthcare workers (HCWs) fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic are under incredible pressure, which puts them at risk of developing mental health problems. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among HCWs responding to COVID-19 and its associated factors. A multi-country cross-sectional study was conducted during July-August 2020 among HCWs responding to COVID-19 in nine Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. Data were collected using an online questionnaire administered using KoBo Toolbox. Mental problems were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). A total of 1448 HCWs from nine EMR countries participated in this study. About 51.2% were male and 52.7% aged Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã‚Â years. Of all HCWs, 57.5% had depression, 42.0% had stress, and 59.1% had anxiety. Considering the severity, 19.2%, 16.1%, 26.6% of patients had severe to extremely severe depression, stress, and anxiety, respectively. Depression, stress, anxiety, and distress scores were significantly associated with participants' residency, having children, preexisting psychiatric illness, and being isolated for COVID-19. Furthermore, females, those working in a teaching hospital, and specialists had significantly higher depression and stress scores. Married status, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, having a friend who died with COVID-19, and high COVID-19 worry scores were significantly associated with higher distress scores. Mental problems were prevalent among HCWs responding to COVID-19 in EMR. Therefore, special interventions to promote mental well-being among HCWs responding to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented.","Ghaleb, Lami, Al Nsour, Rashak, Samy, Khader, Al Serouri, BahaaEldin, Afifi, Elfadul, Ikram, Akhtar, Hussein, Barkia, Hakim, Taha, Hijjo, Kamal, Ahmed, Rahman, Islam, Hussein, Ramzi","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab321","20211013","COVID-19; associated factors; depression; died; stress; stressanxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18803,""
"Substance Use Workforce Training Needs during Intersecting Epidemics: An Analysis of Events Offered by a Regional Training Center from 2017-2020","<b>Background:</b> Intersecting opioid overdose, COVID-19, and systemic racism epidemics havebrought unprecedented challenges to the addiction treatment and recovery workforce. From 2017-2020, the New England Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) collected data in real-time on the training and technical assistance (TA) requested and attended by the front-line workforce. This article synthesizes practice-based evidence on the types of TA requests, topics of TA, attendance numbers, and socio-demographics of TA attendees over a 3-year period spanning an unprecedented public health syndemic. <b>Methods:</b> We assessed TA events hosted by the New England ATTC using SAMHSAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Performance Accountability and Reporting System post-event survey data from 2017-2020. Events were coded by common themes to identify the most frequently requested training types/topics and most frequently attended training events. We also evaluated change in training topics and attendee demographics over the three-year timeline. <b>Results:</b> A total of 258 ATTC events reaching 10,143 participants were analyzed. The number of TA events and attendance numbers surged in the 2019-2020 fiscal year as TA events shifted to fully virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The absolute number of opioid-related events increased, but the relative proportion remained stable over time. The relative proportions of events and attendance rates focused on evidence-based practice and health equity both increased over the 3-year period, with the largest increase after the onset of the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd. As events shifted to virtual, events were attended by providers with a broader range of educational backgrounds. <b>Conclusions:</b> Results of the current analysis indicate that the demand for TA increased during the pandemic, with a prioritization of TA focused on evidence-based practice and health equity. The practice-based evidence generated from the New England ATTC may help other training and TA centers to anticipate and nimbly respond to the needs of the workforce in the face of the intersecting epidemics.","Scott, Salas, Bayles, Sanchez, Martin, Becker","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-956280/v1","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18804,""
"Eating disorders and trajectory of mental health across the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the Understanding America study","Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand how those with eating disorders (EDs) are affected by the pandemic. Using data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), we examined the association between EDs and mental health and how the relationship changed over time across the months following the institution of virus containment procedures (e.g., social distancing, quarantine). The analytic sample consisted of 7137 adults (Mage =50.58 years; SD =16.10) who completed surveys between waves 1-11 of the UAS study. Participants self-reported ED diagnosis (i.e., yes, no, or unsure) and completed self-report measures of psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness. Multilevel models were used to compare trajectories of psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness among ED groups. Individuals with EDs and unsure EDs had higher levels of psychological distress, perceived stress, and loneliness compared to those without EDs. Those unsure about their EDs showed initial decreases in perceived stress and loneliness but started increasing again after some time. Levels of loneliness among those with EDs increased initially but later began to decrease; individuals with EDs showed steady decreases in perceived stress. Type, severity, and duration of EDs were unspecified in the self-reported measure of EDs, which could differentiate the trajectories of outcomes. Intervention is crucial for mitigating mental health problems among those with a history of ED symptoms during COVID-19. Further, results showed that individuals who are unsure about their ED status may be experiencing more fluctuation in mental health across the pandemic.","Kim, Wang, Mason","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100187","20211013","Covid-19; Eating disorders; Loneliness; Perceived stress; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18805,""

"Social distancing and anxiety among female caregivers of children ages zero-to-five during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown in the United States","Past studies have linked measures of social isolation to mental health among caregivers of children. As people across the world adjust to social distancing measures, there is a need to understand consequences of social distancing measures on mental health. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the association between adherence to social distancing measures and feeling worried/anxious among female caregivers of children ages zero-to-five. Data for this study came from an online survey that was administered between May and June 2020 to understand stress and mental health among caregivers of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 358 female caregivers was analyzed using binary logistic regression with feeling worried/anxious as the outcome variable. More than a third of the female caregivers (35.2%) reported feeling worried/anxious during the past month and about 42% reported strictly adhering to social distancing measures. Controlling for the effect of other factors, caregivers who reported strictly adhering to social distancing had 1.86 times higher odds of feeling worried/anxious when compared caregivers who were not strictly adhering to social distancing (AOR=1.86, 95% C.I.=1.07-3.24). Caregivers who felt bothered by withdrawal from activities of interest had 4.11 times higher odds of reporting feeling worried/anxious (AOR=4.11, 95% C.I.=2.32-7.24).

COVID-19 survivors compared to pre-COVID-19 time and controls showed reduced HRQoL and a lower score in Social Functioning (SF) and Role Physical (RP), and Role Emotional (RE) health. Females compared to males had a higher risk of experiencing mental health problems. Also, patients with severe disease had a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety, but not PTSD. Regarding HRQoL, we were not able to perform a subgroup analysis due to a lack of data. Also, the included studies mainly used a self-rating scale to detect psychological problems in their study population.

"Laughter therapy: A humor-induced hormonal intervention to reduce stress and anxiety","Prolonged pharmacological interventions have detrimental health consequences by developing drug tolerance or drug resistance, in addition to adverse drug events. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic-related stress has adversely affected the emotional and mental health aspects around the globe. Consequently, depression is growing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides specific pharmacological interventions, which if prolonged have detrimental health consequences, non-pharmacological interventions are needed to minimize the emotional burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Laughter therapy is a universal non-pharmacologic approach to reduce stress and anxiety. Therapeutic laughter is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily implementable intervention that can be used during this pandemic as a useful supplementary therapy to reduce the mental health burden. Laughter therapy can physiologically lessen the pro-stress factors and increase the mood-elevating anti-stress factors to reduce anxiety and depression. In this ongoing stressful period of the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping necessary social distancing, it is important to create a cheerful environment that will facilitate laughter among the family, neighbor, and community to cope with the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Akimbekov, Razzaque","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crphys.2021.04.002","20211013","Anxiety; Depression; Insomnia; Laughter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18809,""
"Job Insecurity during an Economic Crisis: the Psychological Consequences of Widespread Corporate Cost-Cutting Announcements","Economic crises, such as the one induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting widespread corporate cost-cutting, drastically alter the nature of work. Job insecurity represents a critical intermediate between the economic ramifications of an economic crisis and work and stress outcomes, however, the underlying cognitive consequences of job insecurity and how to buffer those effects are not well understood. We examine how corporate cost-cutting announcements indirectly relate to employees' attention through their relationship with employee job insecurity and investigate supervisor support as a potential buffer of these relationships. We used multi-source data to test our research model, combining data on cost-cutting announcements (budget cuts, layoffs, and furloughs) in news articles for 165 organizations with survey data from 421 full-time employees from these organizations between March 26, 2020 and April 8, 2020. Cost-cutting announcements are positively related to job insecurity, which is related to employee's attention with supervisor support mitigating the effects of job insecurity on attention. Grounded in self-regulation theories, we contribute to and extend the theoretical understanding of the organizational context for job insecurity and cognitive outcomes. We discuss the implications for organizations to manage and prepare for future economic crises, specifically on organizational communication and supervisor interventions.","Van Egdom, Spitzmueller, Wen, Kazmi, Baranski, Flin, Krishnamoorti","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41542-021-00102-8","20211013","Attention; COVID-19; Cost-cutting; Job insecurity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18810,""

There was a significant main effect (higher for the control group) on coronavirus worry and a significant interaction between the intervention and time for perceived stress, with the treatment/control group experiencing decreased/increased stress over time. There was also a significant interaction between the intervention and time for sleep problems with the intervention group experiencing declines in sleep problems over time and also being more likely to experience optimal amounts of sleep over time. The Koru intervention effectively increased state mindfulness, decreased stress, and improved sleep, suggesting that it is robust even under extremely stressful conditions. This study adds to the growing evidence that MBIs can play an important role in addressing rising concerns regarding the mental health of college students.","Smit, Stavrulaki","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-021-01772-9","20211013","College students; Coronavirus; Koru mindfulness intervention; Pandemic; Personality; Sleep; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18811,""
"[State of child and adolescent mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year]","The aim of this project was to evaluate the psychopathological impact of home confinement and school closing between March and September 2020 on the mental health of Catalonian children. PEDSAME study: first cross-sectional section (beginning of the school year) and retrospective data (lockdown), carried out through the network of Primary Care pediatricians in the Catalan population between 5 and 14 years (included) from 09/14/2020 to 10/30/2020 in a random sample. Data were collected with an online survey through the RedCap platform at the beginning of the school year. The main variable was the result of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire answered by parents to assess the risk of psychopathology, in addition to other related variable. The results obtained at the beginning of the school year show that 9.8% of the patients were probable cases of psychopathology. The most affected group were those between 5 and 8 years. The perception of the children's level of concern for their health and that of their family was a risk factor for presenting psychopathology, while the good family environment was a protective factor. Emotional and behavioral symptoms, sleep disorders and problematic use of screens were detected more frequently during confinement than at the beginning of the school year. Confinement and the absence of schooling for 6 months had a negative impact on the mental health of the child-adolescent population who showed worse indicators than the previous year.","Gatell-CarbÃƒÂ³, Alcover-Bloch, Balaguer-MartÃƒÂ­nez, PÃƒÂ©rez-Porcuna, Esteller-Carceller, ÃƒÂlvarez-Garcia, Fortea-Gimeno","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2021.08.008","20211013","Coronavirus infections; Lockdown; Mental health; Pandemics; Pediatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18812,""
"Changes in Healthcare Workers' Anxiety During Two Time Points of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From a Longitudinal Study","Evidence on the within-person changes of healthcare workers' mental health across waves of COVID-19 cases during this pandemic is absent. The aim of this study is to examine the within-person changes of anxiety in Argentinean healthcare workers, adjusting for main demographic factors, regionÃ‚Â of residence, mental disorder history, and COVID-19 contagion, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal web survey (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°305) was conducted during two time points of the pandemic, one of which was an infection peak. Anxiety significantly increased across time. However, there were significant interaction effects modulating anxiety levels. The largest anxiety increases occurred in healthcare workers who were not sure if they had contracted COVID-19 while symptomatic. Irrespective of the time point, anxiety was the highest in healthcare workers from a region inside the country who were not sure if they had contracted COVID-19, either asymptomatic or symptomatic. An interaction effect between the mental disorder history and the COVID-19 contagion suggested that the anxiety outcomes were mainly due to the concern about the COVID-19 contagion, rather than due to pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities. Regardless of the starting point in anxiety levels, an increasing anxiety outcome may be expected among healthcare workers as the pandemic progresses. The uncertainty regarding COVID-19 contagion is a preventable and modifiable interacting factor to produce the worst anxiety outcomes among healthcare workers.","LÃƒÂ³pez Steinmetz, Herrera, Fong, Godoy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00667-z","20211013","COVID-19; Developing countries; Health personnel; Infections, Coronavirus; Mental disorders; Uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18813,""
"The relationship between COVID-related parenting stress, nonresponsive feeding behaviors, and parent mental health","COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of families across the United States and all over the world. Stress is known to have a negative impact on parent-child feeding interactions; hence, the purpose of this study is to examine how COVID-related parenting stress, which was measured using a newly developed scale, is related to parent mental health, nonresponsive feeding, and children's self-regulation of eating. 119 parents of children ages 2-7Ã‚Â years old filled out questions about COVID-related parenting stress, mental health, nonresponsive feeding behaviors, and children's self-regulation of eating. A series of multiple regressions were run to predict parent anxiety and psychological distress from COVID-related parenting stress. COVID-related parenting stress was found to be a significant predictor of both parent anxiety and psychological distress. When COVID-related parenting stress was further broken down into COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress and COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress, COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress predicted psychological distress while COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress predicted parent anxiety. Moderation analyses were also run to test the difference across the parents of children under 5Ã‚Â years of age and those of children who were 5Ã‚Â years of age and older regarding the association of COVID-related parenting stress and either parent anxiety or psychological distress. There was no significant difference across age. Lastly, COVID-related parenting stress and nonresponsive feeding practices were simultaneously entered into a multiple regression to predict children's self-regulation of eating, and COVID-related parenting stress and parent distrust in appetite were both found to decrease children's ability to self-regulate energy intake. Based on findings from this study, researchers interested in improving children's self-regulation of eating and long-term health outcomes should continue to target the reduction of nonresponsive parent feeding behaviors, but they should also aim to look beyond specific parent feeding behaviors by attempting to help parents manage stressors in their lives.

"Differences in psychiatric symptoms between the UK and Greece prior to and during COVID-19: The roles of subclinical narcissism and mental toughness","At the onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, countries reported elevated rates of psychiatric symptoms. Previous research indicates that subclinical narcissism may reduce depression and stress through mental toughness. The researchers collected data from the United Kingdom (UK) and Greece (GR) on self-reported depression, anxiety, stress, COVID-19 related worry, subclinical narcissism, and mental toughness. Two samples, one cross-sectional (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1846) and one semi-longitudinal (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 184), were used to compare rates of psychiatric symptoms pre and during COVID-19 across the UK and GR, and to test a path model in which subclinical narcissism reduced psychiatric symptoms through mental toughness. From pre to during COVID-19, UK participants exhibited increased depression, lower anxiety, and no change in stress, whereas GR participants showed a decrease in anxiety and stress and consistently low symptoms of depression. Subclinical narcissism exerted a negative indirect effect on psychiatric symptoms through mental toughness in both samples, but a negative total effect on anxiety and stress only in the UK sample. Findings indicate that exploring links between narcissism and prosocial traits can provide novel insights into differences in the adaptive use of personality traits in relation to mental health.","Truhan, Gianniou, Papageorgiou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111308","20211013","COVID-19; Mental health; Mental toughness; Psychiatric symptoms; Subclinical narcissism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18815,""
"Sensory-processing sensitivity and COVID-19 stress in a young population: The mediating role of resilience","Psychologists worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the negative impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on adolescents' mental health. However, compared to studies involving adults, research using a young population is limited. To further understand the mental health of older adolescents and young adults during the pandemic, the present study examined whether resilience, as a protective factor, buffers the relationship between the personality trait of environmental sensitivity and COVID-19-related distress. In total, 441 older adolescents and young adults (53.7% women, <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 18.91Ã‚Â years, <i>SD</i> <sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.82Ã‚Â years) living in urban Japan completed an online cross-sectional survey in October 2020. The results showed that sensitivity was positively, though weakly, correlated with COVID-19 stress and negatively correlated with resilience. Resilience was negatively correlated with COVID-19 stress. Mediation analysis showed that resilience buffered the negative relationship between sensitivity and COVID-19 stress, and its indirect effect was statistically significant, albeit close to zero. These results suggest that higher sensitivity is not necessarily a vulnerability factor, if resilience can be enhanced.","Iimura","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111183","20211013","Adolescence; COVID-19; Environmental sensitivity; Resilience; Sensory-processing sensitivity; Stress; Young adulthood","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18816,""
"[Emotional and psychological status of nursing staff attacked during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America]","The new COVID-19 disease is worldwide. During the pandemic, attacks on healthcare staff have increased. The objective of the study was to know the incidence of aggression towards nursing staff and to evaluate the main emotional and psychological symptoms experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. A cross-sectional survey was applied to nursing staff of Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Sociodemographic information was obtained concerning aggression, psychological symptoms, and emotional state. Descriptive statistics were applied in frequencies and percentages, means and standard deviation. 310 people from Mexico (65.2%), Argentina (5.8%), Colombia (5.2%), Honduras (5.2%), Costa Rica (4.5%) and other Latin American countries (14.1%) participated. 78.1% were women, with an average age of 35.2 years. 79.6% of the sample reported being attacked or discriminated against. The most common emotions were fear of getting sick (73.7%), sleep disturbances (33.4%), fear of infecting their relatives (33.4%). The mental health disorders reported were anxiety (29.2%), sadness (10.4%) and increased appetite (8.8%). The most frequent locations of aggression were the street and public transport. Our results suggest a high incidence of aggression against nursing staff during the pandemic; in any case, the staff present emotional and mental disturbances. It is necessary to develop safety and security policies for nursing staff and provide mental health care to staff who are on the first line of defence against COVID-19.","De La Cruz, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Castro, Pool-GarcÃƒÂ­a, LÃƒÂ³pez-NarvÃƒÂ¡ez, Tovilla-ZÃƒÂ¡rate","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.08.006","20211013","Aggression; COVID-19; Latin America; mental health; nursing staff; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18817,""
"The risk and protective factors of heightened prenatal anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 lockdown","While pregnant women are already at-risk for developing symptoms of anxiety and depression, this is heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared anxiety and depression symptoms, as indicators of psychological distress, before and during COVID-19, and investigated the role of partner, social network and healthcare support on COVID-19-related worries and consequently on psychological distress. A national survey, conducted during the first lockdown in The Netherlands, assessed COVID-19 experiences and psychological distress (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1421), whereas a comparison sample (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1439) was screened for psychological distress in 2017-2018. During COVID-19, the percentage of mothers scoring above the questionnaires' clinical cut-offs doubled for depression (6% and 12%) and anxiety (24% and 52%). Women reported increased partner support during COVID-19, compared to pre-pandemic, but decreased social and healthcare support. Higher support resulted in lower COVID-19-related worries, which in turn contributed to less psychological distress. Results suggest that a global pandemic exerts a heavy toll on pregnant women's mental health. Psychological distress was substantially higher during the pandemic than the pre-pandemic years. We identified a protective role of partner, social, and healthcare support, with important implications for the current and future crisis management. Whether increased psychological distress is transient or persistent, and whether and how it affects the future generation remains to be determined.","Vacaru, Beijers, Browne, Cloin, van Bakel, van den Heuvel, de Weerth","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99662-6","20211013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18818,""
"General Aviation Flight Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE:</b> The COVID-19 virus has caused over 582,000 deaths in the United States to date. However, the pandemic has also afflicted the mental health of the population at large in the domains of anxiety and sleep disruption, potentially interfering with cognitive function. From an aviation perspective, safely operating an aircraft requires an airmans cognitive engagement for: 1) situational awareness, 2) spatial orientation, and 3) avionics programming. Since impaired cognitive function could interfere with such tasks, the current study was undertaken to determine if flight safety for a cohort of single engine, piston-powered light airplanes was adversely affected during a period of the pandemic (MarchOctober 2020) prior to U.S. approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine. <b>METHODS:</b> Airplane accidents were per the National Transportation Safety Board Access&lt;sup/&gt; database. Fleet times were derived using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. Statistics used Poisson distributions, Chi-squared/Fisher, and Mann-Whitney tests. <b>RESULTS:</b> Little difference in accident rate was evident between the pandemic period (MarchOctober 2020) and the preceding (JanuaryFebruary) months (19 and 22 mishaps/100,000 h, respectively). Similarly, a proportional comparison of accidents occurring in 2020 with those for the corresponding months in 2019 failed to show over-representation of mishaps during the pandemic. Although a trend to a higher injury severity (43% vs. 34% serious/fatal injuries) was evident for pandemic-period mishaps, the proportional difference was not statistically significant when referencing the corresponding months in 2019. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> Surprisingly, using accidents as an outcome, the study herein shows little evidence of diminished flight safety for light aircraft operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Boyd DD. <i>General aviation flight safety during the COVID-19 pandemic</i>.

"Latent class analysis of depression and anxiety among medical students during COVID-19 epidemic","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency that has caused worldwide concern. The mental health of medical students under the COVID-19 epidemic has attracted much attention. This study aims to identify subgroups of medical students based on depression and anxiety and explore the influencing factors during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. A total of 29,663 medical students were recruited during the epidemic of COVID-19 in China. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) respectively. Latent class analysis was performed based on depression and anxiety symptoms in medical students. The latent class subtypes were compared using the chi-square test. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associations between identified classes and related factors. In this study, three distinct subgroups were identified, namely, the poor mental health group, the mild mental health group and the low symptoms group. The number of medical students in each class is 4325, 9321 and 16,017 respectively. The multinomial logistic regression results showed that compared with the low symptoms group, the factors influencing depression and anxiety in the poor mental health group and mild mental health group were sex, educational level, drinking, individual psychiatric disorders, family psychiatric disorders, knowledge of COVID-19, fear of being infected, and participate in mental health education on COVID-19. Our findings suggested that latent class analysis can be used to categorize different medical students according to their depression and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak of COVID-19. The main factors influencing the poor mental health group and the mild mental health group are basic demographic characteristics, disease history, COVID-19 related factors and behavioural lifestyle. School administrative departments can carry out targeted psychological counseling according to different subgroups to promote the physical and mental health of medical students.","Liu, Liu, Zhang, Zhang, Liang, Wang, Wei, Zhu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03459-w","20211013","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Latent class analysis; Medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18820,""
"The COVIDPregDK Study: A national survey on pregnancy during the early COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark","We aimed to describe the aim, data collection and content from a survey completed among pregnant women during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. The declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 challenged pregnant women's mental well-being due to a concern for their unborn child and their need for healthcare services through pregnancy and birth. To explore how the COVID-19 pandemic and the intensified measures such as the lockdown of Denmark impacted pregnant women's well-being and mental health, we conducted a questionnaire survey in the spring of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its first peak, and the consequences for pregnant women and the unborn child were very uncertain. All women residing in Denmark and registered with an ongoing pregnancy on 24 April 2020 were invited to participate. The questionnaire included background information, variables on COVID-19 symptoms and validated batteries of questions on loneliness, anxiety, stress, quality of life, meditation and prayers. Additional questions were included to examine concerns related to pregnancy and childbirth during the pandemic. Almost 18,000 women answered the questionnaire, which represents 60% of all invited women who experienced a national lockdown for the first time. Their median age was 30 years, and they were more likely to be multiparous.

"Long-Term Impact of Economic Downturn and Loneliness on Psychological Distress: Triple Crises of COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 crisis poses global mental health and global economy challenges. However, there is a lack of longitudinal research investigating whether financial instability and social disruption may increase the risk of developing mental health problems over time that may potentially outlast the pandemic. We conducted an online survey for members of the general population (<i>n</i> = 2703) in Germany during the twelve months spanning from April 2020 to March 2021. We investigated the development of COVID-19 related psychological distress, the number of unemployed people, federal government debt, income distribution, and loneliness over the time period. Over a period of twelve months, 53.6% of respondents in Germany reported experiencing psychological distress, varying from mild levels, 34.2%, to severe levels, 19.4%, of distress. High federal government debt, high incident COVID-19 cases, low incomes, and the prevalence of loneliness were found to be associated with increased long-term mental health problems. Psychological distress scores were most strongly increased in female and young respondents as well as those who reported fewer years of education, low income, and higher loneliness. Our study highlights factors that have a long-term impact on mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest that specific mental-health services could be offered to support high-risk groups experiencing financial fragility and loneliness. For purposes of safeguarding their mental health there is a need to monitor and track such risk factors in real time.","Liu, Haucke, Heinzel, Heinz","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194596","20211013","government debt; income; mental health and wellbeing; perceived social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18822,""
"High Rate of Elder Abuse in the Time of COVID-19-A Cross Sectional Study of Geriatric and Neurology Clinic Patients","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have caused a sharp increase in the incidence of elder abuse (EA), including as a result of isolation, social distance combined with increased interpersonal stressors. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the elder abuse rates and the characteristics of risk factors. A total of 347 patients hospitalized in the Department of Neurology and Department of Geriatrics at University Hospital No. 1 in Bydgoszcz were selected as subjects for the analysis. The tools used in the study are: Authors-Designed Questionnaire, the Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Activities of Daily Living Scale. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, Spearman's rank correlation test, and logistic regression analyses were used. In the studied population, nearly 45% of the elderly were victims of violence. This represents an increase of more than 6 percent compared to the pre-pandemic. The most common type of EA was psychological abuse (72.3%). In the final models, the risk factors include, among others, low income (OR = 3.60, 95% CI = 1.93-6.72), chronic diseases (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.28-3.31), poor relationship with the family (OR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.96-5.43), and moderate and severe depression (OR = 18.29, 95% CI = 10.24-32.69; OR = 18.49, 95% CI = 3.91-87.30, respectively). Moreover, moderate functional impairment 5.52 times more often and severe functional impairment 21.07 times more likely to predispose to EA. People who suffered from COVID-19 are 1.59 times more likely to be victims of EA (95% CI = 1.03-2.46).

"Impact on the Mental and Physical Health of the Portuguese Population during the COVID-19 Confinement","Confinement of the population has been one of the measures implemented by different governments to address the COVID-19 health crisis, and it has led to social isolation together with a disruption of daily activities. The aim of the study is to analyze psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. During the quarantine, a cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of 2120 subjects over 18 years of age, resident and born in Portugal. Data were collected using a self-developed questionnaire that considered socio-demographic variables, physical symptoms, health conditions, and history of contact with COVID-19, as well as psychological alterations. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was also included. Univariate and bivariate statistical analyses were performed. Predictive capacity was studied using logistic regression models. The results showed a higher percentage of individuals presenting psychological distress (57.2.0%), with a higher percentage identified among women (79.0%), and in people with a higher educational level (bachelor's + master's and doctorate) (75.8%). The predictor variables with the greatest weight were sex, educational level (graduation, master's, and doctorate), living with children or under 16 years of age, presence of symptoms, and quarantine in the last 14 days for having symptoms. Good self-assessment of health and working at home appear to be protective against psychological distress. These results highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress and provide an opportunity to consider the need to implement specific multidisciplinary public health and mental health interventions in this pandemic situation.","Frade, Jacobsohn, GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado, Martins, Allande-CussÃƒÂ³, Ruiz-Frutos, Frade","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194464","20211013","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; psychological distress; public health; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18824,""
"Psychosocial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers and Initial Areas of Action for Intervention and Prevention-The egePan/VOICE Study","Epidemics lead to an increase in occupational stress and psychological strain among healthcare workers. However, the impact of a pandemic outbreak on healthcare systems is yet to be clearly defined. Therefore, this work aims to describe and analyze specific areas of workload among different groups of healthcare workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of N = 8088 persons working in the German-speaking healthcare sector participated in the VOICE/egePan online survey, which addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. We used 15 self-constructed items, based on the work of Matsuishi et al. (2012), to identify potential COVID-19-specific topics. N = 7542 records of healthcare workers were analyzed. Of these, 60.80% reported, retrospectively, an increase in stress since the outbreak of the pandemic. Problem areas tended to be indicated more frequently by the women surveyed than by the men. Nurses, paramedics and medical technicians reported the highest fear of infecting others while physicians reported the highest fear of physical or mental exhaustion. With respect to age, older respondents indicated less fear and felt more protected. Men and people living alone were more likely to use dysfunctional coping strategies. Migrants reported a higher fear of becoming infected or infecting others as well as they reported about increased levels of smoking.

"Mental Health Services Data Dashboards for Reporting to Australian Governments during COVID-19","The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) has been providing support to the Australian Government Department of Health to report on mental health-related data to Australian governments on a frequent basis since April 2020 in the form of COVID-19 mental health services data dashboards. These dashboards feature extensive use of data visualizations which illustrate the change in mental health service use over time as well as comparisons with pre-pandemic levels of service use. Data are included from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS/RPBS), Australian Government-funded crisis and support organizations, and key findings from emerging research. Demand for telehealth, crisis and support organizations and online mental health information services, in particular, have increased during the pandemic. The dashboards incorporate both new and existing data sources and represent an innovative way of reporting mental health services data to Australian governments. The reporting has enabled timely, targeted adjustments to mental health service delivery during the pandemic with improved cooperative data sharing arrangements having the potential to yield ongoing benefits.","Shelly, Lodge, Heyman, Summers, Young, Brew, James","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910514","20211013","COVID-19; mental; pandemic; services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18826,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Intimate Partner Violence against Women in the Czech Republic: Incidence and Associated Factors","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a burning social issue worldwide. According to global statistics, the incidence of IPV has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictive measures (e.g., reduced social contacts, the need to stay at home often with a perpetrator in the same household). This study aims to provide data about the incidence of IPV and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. A representative online sample of 429 Czech women living with a partner at least 3 months before COVID-19 participated in the study. In an online interview, women reported IPV incidents 3 months before and during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using non-parametric repeated measures ANOVA, a significant difference between the total IPV score and the given time periods was found. In addition, the results of the research showed a significant effect of the tension in the relationship with the partner, depression rate, and partner support on the total IPV score in the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results bring important insights into IPV incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest factors that might lead to an increased risk of IPV.","PlÃƒÂ¡Ã…Â¡ilovÃƒÂ¡, HÃ…Â¯la, KrejÃ„ÂovÃƒÂ¡, KlapilovÃƒÂ¡","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910502","20211013","COVID-19; intimate partner violence; pandemic; sexual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18827,""
"Perceived Consequences of Extended Social Isolation on Mental Well-Being: Narratives from Indonesian University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Despite several recent studies reporting on young people's well-being during COVID-19, few large-scale qualitative studies have been carried out that capture the experiences of young people from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) undergoing extended social restrictions. The challenges faced by young people from LMICs during COVID-19 are likely to be amplified by their countries' large populations, resource constraints, lack of access to health care, living conditions, socio-spatial contexts, and the pandemic's ramifications for communities. This study explored how youths perceived their well-being after being isolated for one-and-a-half years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative narrative research was employed as a method of inquiry. One-hundred and sixty-six university students in Jakarta, Indonesia, between the ages of 17 and 22 wrote reflective online essays on the consequences of extended pandemic isolation on their mental health. This data collection strategy offered an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon through the narratives of those who experienced it. Seven themes expressing the youths' perceived well-being were identified through inductive reflective thematic analysis: (1) the anguish of loneliness and estrangement; (2) a state of ""brokenness"" resulting from emotional agony and distress; (3) frustration, confusion, and anger; (4) the experience of conflicting emotions; (5) uncertainty about both the present and future; (6) a sense of purpose and fulfillment; and (7) turning to faith. The findings provide important insights into Indonesian youths' well-being following extended social restrictions following the outbreak. Their collective experiences can be used to inform policy and practice regarding the nature of support mechanisms required both during and following the pandemic, and in the future if such a situation were to occur again.","Rahiem, Krauss, Ersing","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910489","20211013","COVID-19 pandemic; adolescents; mental health; online learning; social distancing; social emotional support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18828,""
"An Exploratory Survey of Mental Health Social Work in Europe","This article reports on an exploratory study comparing mental health social work (MHSW) in Europe. There has been very limited previous research comparing approaches to MHSW in Europe and so the aim of the study was to develop a better understanding of the similarities and differences between and, where relevant, within countries (referred to as jurisdictions). An online survey was distributed mainly through existing European networks and social media to seek information on the role, nature, extent and context of MHSW in a range of European jurisdictions. Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 158 responses from 10 jurisdictions. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. From this analysis, four main themes were identified, relating to: role; law, policy and education; the distinctive contribution made by MHSW; and the key challenges for MHSW. The study demonstrates that MHSW, although it is described and provided in different ways and is confined by a range of factors, plays an important role in mental health services across jurisdictions. There are also interesting differences between contexts, especially in the balance of therapeutic, legal and specialist/generic approaches, some of which reflect the World Health Organisation's vision and objectives for mental health. Lastly, the study illustrates a need and provides a valuable basis for further comparative and collaborative work to define MHSW and enhance the contributions it makes.","Stone, McCusker, Davidson, Vicary","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910462","20211013","Europe; involuntary admission; mental health; social work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18829,""
"Implications of the Online Teaching Model Derived from the COVID-19 Lockdown Situation for Anxiety and Executive Functioning in Spanish Children and Adolescents","Given the seriousness of the existing situation regarding the mental health of children and adolescents relating to the confinement period imposed due to COVID-19, we conducted this study to describe the effects of the confinement on state anxiety and executive functioning dimensions in a period of online educational modality. A sample of 953 children and adolescents was assessed. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the State Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the Behavioral Evaluation of Executive Function (BRIEF-2) scale were applied. The analysis of the results indicates that 68.8% of children and adolescents presented medium-high levels of anxiety. Regarding sex, females showed higher levels of anxiety and worse levels of executive functioning. Although the group aged 11 to 18 years showed methodologically higher state anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.041) than the group aged 6 to 10 years, the difference was not clinically relevant (ÃŽÂ´ = -0.113). The state anxiety variable was also correlated positively and significantly to the three executive functioning dimensions explored.

"Maternal Psychological Distress and Children's Internalizing/Externalizing Problems during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Moderating Role Played by Hypermentalization","In order to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the caregiver-child relationship, we investigated the interplay among COVID-19 exposure and children's internalizing/externalizing problems during the Italian lockdown, hypothesizing a mediation effect played by maternal distress. Additionally, we included maternal reflective functioning (i.e., hypermentalization) as a moderator factor among this interplay. A total of 305 Italian mothers of children aged 6-13 years (<i>M</i> = 10.3; <i>SD</i> = 2.4) filled in an online survey. Findings revealed an indirect effect of maternal COVID-19 exposure on children's anxious/depressed (<i>k</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.46) and attention problems (<i>k</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.32) via maternal distress. Hypermentalization moderated the impact of maternal COVID-19 exposure on children's anxious/depressed problems (ÃŽÂ² = -1.08, <i>p</i> = 0.04). Hypermentalization moderated both the relation between maternal distress and children's aggressive behaviors (ÃŽÂ² = 12.226; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and between maternal distress and children's attention problems (ÃŽÂ² = 5.617, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). We found pivotal significant effects of maternal hypermentalization on children's anxious/depressed and attention problems, indicating that the higher the mother's hypermentalization was, the higher the children's problems were.

"Telework and Psychological Health in Hospital Staff during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Epidemic in France","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a change in work organization with the development of telework. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in teleworking staff in a university hospital center in France during the first lockdown, and to identify personal, medical and occupational factors associated with anxiety disorder. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in 474 hospital staff working from home during the first lockdown. The sociodemographic, occupational and medical information (anxiety and depressive disorders measured on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale) was collected by an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire. The variables associated with anxiety disorder were investigated by a univariate analysis (chiÃ‚Â² and Fisher tests) and a multivariate analysis (logistic regression model). Three hundred and forty hospital staff participated in the study (72% response rate). Of the participants, 106 subjects (32.1%) showed signs of an anxiety disorder and 26 (7.65%) of a depressive disorder. An anxiety disorder was significantly associated with mental workload, changes in working hours, difficulties in teleworking due to issues of internet connection or due to noise, difficulties in combining family and occupational life, sleep disturbance, worry about media information and worry about the health of a loved one. An anxiety disorder remained associated with occupational stress and personal stress during lockdown after a multivariate logistic regression. This study highlighted the association between an anxiety disorder and perceived occupational and personal stress levels in hospital staff teleworking during the first lockdown. Stress management workshops could be proposed to hospital staff. Prevention of anxiety requires reinforced medical monitoring and reduced stress.","Pelissier, Paredes, Moulin, Bitot, Fakra, Fontana","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910433","20211013","COVID-19 pandemic; hospital workers; mental health; stress; telework","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18832,""

These activity records were compiled from existing material in the Sendai City Office; therefore, no new interviews or questionnaire surveys were conducted. <i>Results</i>: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced telephone counseling and shortened the time of support as a result of the restrictions. Counselors addressed issues of ""loneliness"" or ""isolation"" among evacuees, who had little connection with society due to the pandemic. Moreover, the procedure for obtaining COVID-19 special financial aid was explained to evacuees in financial difficulty.

"Cutting Oxygen Production-Related Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Improved Compression Heat Management in a Cryogenic Air Separation Unit","Oxygen production in cryogenic air separation units is related to a significant carbon footprint and its supply in the medicinal sphere became critical during the recent COVID-19 crisis. An improved unit design was proposed, utilizing a part of waste heat produced during air pre-cooling and intercooling via absorption coolers, to reduce power consumption. Variable ambient air humidity impact on compressed air dryers' regeneration was also considered. A steady-state process simulation of a model 500 t h<sup>-1</sup> inlet cryogenic air separation unit was performed in Aspen Plus<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> V11. Comparison of a model without and with absorption coolers yielded an achievable reduction in power consumption for air compression and air dryer regeneration by 6 to 9% (23 to 33 GWh year<sup>-1</sup>) and a favorable simple payback period of 4 to 10 years, both depending on air pressure loss in additional heat exchangers to be installed. The resulting specific oxygen production decrease amounted to EUR 2-4.2 t<sup>-1</sup>. Emissions of major gaseous pollutants from power production were both calculated by an in-house developed thermal power plant model and adopted from literature. A power consumption cut was translated into the following annual greenhouse gas emission reduction: CO<sub>2</sub> 16 to 30 kilotons, CO 0.3 to 2.3 tons, SO<sub>x</sub> 4.7 to 187 tons and NO<sub>x</sub> 11 to 56 tons, depending on applied fossil fuel-based emission factors.

"Efficacy of the FIBROWALK Multicomponent Program Moved to a Virtual Setting for Patients with Fibromyalgia during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Proof-of-Concept RCT Performed Alongside the State of Alarm in Spain","FIBROWALK is a multicomponent program including pain neuroscience education, therapeutic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness training that has recently been found to be effective in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). This RCT started before the COVID-19 pandemic and was moved to a virtual format (i.e., online videos) when the lockdown was declared in Spain. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a virtual FIBROWALK compared to Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) in patients with FM during the first state of alarm in Spain. A total of 151 patients with FM were randomized into two study arms: FIBROWALK plus TAU vs. TAU alone. The primary outcome was functional impairment. Secondary outcomes were kinesiophobia, anxiety and depressive symptomatology, and physical functioning. Differences between groups at post-treatment assessment were analyzed using Intention-To-Treat (ITT) and completer approaches. Baseline differences between clinical responders and non-responders were also explored. Statistically significant improvements with small-to-moderate effect sizes were observed in FIBROWALK+TAU vs. TAU regarding functional impairment and most secondary outcomes.

"Qualitative Investigation into Therapists' Experiences of Online Therapy: Implications for Working Clients","Online therapy has increasingly been utilised during the COVID-19 pandemic by many, including working populations. However, few qualitative studies have explored how online therapy is experienced in practice and discussed its implications for those working clients. Semi-structured interviews attended by nine integrative psychotherapists practising in California, the United States, were conducted. Thematic analysis of the transcripts identified three themes: (i) 'Positive experiences of online therapy', (ii) 'Challenges experienced by therapists and clients in online therapy', and (iii) 'Preparation and training for online therapy'. Online therapy was assessed as being helpful, particularly in terms of mitigating against previous geographical and temporal barriers to uptake. However, due to technological disruptions and potential blurring of professional boundaries, online therapy may detract from the emotional salience of therapy, negatively impacting the therapeutic relationship and containment. Considering these positive experiences, participants expected that the demand for online therapy would continue to increase. Particularly in the occupational context, online therapy can offer interventions without fostering shame regarding mental health. The findings provide preliminary qualitative evidence that online therapy can be a useful adjunct to traditional forms of face-to-face therapy. However, therapists require more explicit training in implementing online therapy.

"The Cross-Sectional Relations of COVID-19 Fear and Stress to Psychological Distress among Frontline Healthcare Workers in Selangor, Malaysia","Previous pandemics have demonstrated short and long-term impacts on healthcare workers' mental health, causing knock-on effects on patient care and professional functioning. Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented disruption in social interactions and working conditions. Malaysia has been under the Recovery Movement Control Order since June 2020; however, with the upsurge of cases, healthcare workers face pressure not only from working in resource-deprived settings but also from the increasing patient load. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship of COVID-19 fear and stress to psychological distress (operationalized as anxiety and depression) in healthcare workers. The present sample included 286 frontline healthcare workers from three hospitals in Selangor, Malaysia. Self-administered questionnaires containing sociodemographic and occupational items, the Malay versions of the Coronavirus Stress Measure scale, the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were distributed via online platforms. Hierarchical multiple regression findings suggest that age, shift work, and COVID-19 stress consistently predicted anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers after adjusting for sociodemographic and occupational variables. The present findings suggest that frontline healthcare workers are not only inoculated against COVID-19 itself but also against the psychological sequelae of the pandemic.","Subhas, Pang, Chua, Kamu, Ho, David, Goh, Gunasegaran, Tan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910182","20211013","COVID-19 fear; COVID-19 stress; anxiety; depression; frontline healthcare workers; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18840,""

The results showed that teens' weekly subreddit participation, posting/commenting frequency, and emotion expression were related to significant pandemic events. Teen Redditors on r/Teenagers had a higher posting/commenting frequency but lower negative emotion than teen Redditors on the three mental health subreddits. When comparing posts/comments on r/Teenagers, teens who ever visited one of the three mental health subreddits posted/commented twice as frequently as teens who did not, but their emotion expression was similar. The results from the Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) indicated that both teens with and without mental health concerns reversed the trend in posting frequency and negative emotion from declining to increasing right after the pandemic outbreak, and teens with mental health concerns had a more rapidly increasing trend in posting/commenting. The findings suggest that teens' social media engagement and emotion expression reflect the pandemic evolution. Teens with mental health concerns are more likely to reveal their emotions on specialized mental health subreddits rather than on the general r/Teenagers subreddit. In addition, the findings indicated that teens with mental health concerns had a strong social interaction desire that various barriers in the real world may inhibit. The findings call for more attention to understand the pandemic's influence on teens by monitoring and analyzing social media data and offering adequate support to teens regarding their mental health wellbeing.","Zhang, Liu, Li, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910079","20211013","COVID-19; emotion expression; mental health; posting behavior; social media; time series; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18842,""
"Epidemiological Study of Violence against Children and Its Increase during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of this study was to identify the epidemiological profiles of violence against children, victims, and their aggressors, and their correlations between socioeconomic and demographic factors analyzed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional, retrospective observational study based on a review of Individual Notification Forms from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases, including child victims of violence, under 18 years, assisted by a pediatric emergency service in Brazil, from 2016-2020. Data were stratified, then statistical analysis was performed using the two-proportion equality test and the Chi-square test, with <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. A total of 609 notifications were analyzed and a prevalence of sexual violence (63.2%) was reported. The prevalent profile of victim was female (76.7%), aged between 2-9 years (38.1%) and 14-18 years (35.6%). The violence occurs in the victim's home (58.9%). The prevalent profile of perpetrator was male (82.4%), young adolescent (59.2%), living as family (64%), mainly the parents (18.4%). No correlation was found between the classified socioeconomic and demographic variables and violence. There was an increase in notifications during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the same period in the previous year; self-harm was reported in 59.7% of physical violence in 2020. Prevalence of sexual violence was higher for females, aged between 2-9 and 14-18 years, victimized in their homes, by male offenders, living as family, mainly by their parents. No association was found between child violence and the socioeconomic and demographic.","de Oliveira, Galdeano, da Trindade, Fernandez, Buchaim, Buchaim, da Cunha, Passos","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910061","20211013","COVID-19 pandemic; child abuse; emergency hospital service; exposure to violence; risk factors; self-destructive behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18843,""
"Are Spaniards Happier When the Bars Are Open? Using Life Satisfaction to Evaluate COVID-19 Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)","The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged governments worldwide with the design of appropriate policies that maximize health outcomes while minimizing economic and mental health consequences. This paper explores sources of individuals' life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic, paying special attention to the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We studied the specific case of Spanish regions and focused on bar and restaurant closures using data from a continuous voluntary web survey that we merged with information about region-specific policies that identified when and where bars and restaurants were closed. We estimated an endogenous binary-treatment-regression model and found that closing bars and restaurants had a significant negative impact on happiness. The results were statistically significant after controlling for the pandemic context, health, income, work, and other personal characteristics and circumstances. We interpreted the results in terms of the positive effect of socialization, individuals' feelings of freedom, and the comparative nature of life satisfaction.","Pedraza, Vicente","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910056","20211013","COVID-19; NPIs; life satisfaction; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18844,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Disorders A Critical Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of the worldwide population. Citizens suffer the social, economic, physiological, and psychological effects of this pandemic. Primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages were used for a consensus critical review. The method was a narrative review of the available literature to summarize the existing literature addressing mental health concerns and stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main search engines used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. We found the pandemic has had a direct impact on psychopathologies such as anxiety, increasing its ratios, and depression. Other syndromes such as burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder have increased with the pandemic, showing a larger incidence among medical personnel. Moreover, eating disorders and violence have also increased. Public authorities must prepare healthcare systems for increasing incidences of mental pathologies. Mental health apps are one of the tools that can be used to reach the general population.","Clemente-SuÃƒÂ¡rez, MartÃƒÂ­nez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Benitez-Agudelo, Navarro-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Beltran-Velasco, Ruisoto, Diaz Arroyo, Laborde-CÃƒÂ¡rdenas, Tornero-Aguilera","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910041","20211013","COVID-19; anxiety; apps; burnout; depression; eating disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18845,""
"Mood and Changes in Alcohol Consumption in Young Adults during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Model Explaining Associations with Perceived Immune Fitness and Experiencing COVID-19 Symptoms","The aim of this study was to explore the effects of the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown on mood states, stress, alcohol consumption and perceived immune fitness in a Dutch sample. Analysis included a subsample from the ""Corona Lockdown: how fit are you?"" (CLOFIT) study, comprising <i>N</i> = 761 participants who reported consuming alcohol in 2020. Results show that, compared to pre-lockdown, the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020) was associated with experiencing poorer mood (e.g., anxiety, depression, loneliness, fatigue) and increased stress levels. Among younger participants (18 to 35 years old), a significant decrease in weekly alcohol consumption was found during COVID-19 lockdown, which was not significant in older individuals. For the younger age cohort (18 to 35 years old), increased stress significantly correlated to increased weekly alcohol consumption (r = 0.163, <i>p</i> = 0.003), which in turn, correlated significantly to reporting a poorer perceived immune fitness (r = -0.165, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Poorer perceived immune fitness correlated significantly with increases in the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms (r = -0.313, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, and r = -0.325, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). The data provides evidence for significant relationships between changes in mood, stress and alcohol consumption during COVID-19 lockdown, and supports a model that links these changes to perceived immune fitness and susceptibility to experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.","Merlo, Severeijns, Benson, Scholey, Garssen, Bruce, Verster","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910028","20211013","COVID-19; alcohol consumption; immune fitness; mood; social isolation; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18846,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Loneliness and Social Isolation: A Multi-Country Study","The COVID-19 global pandemic and subsequent public health social measures have challenged our social and economic life, with increasing concerns around potentially rising levels of social isolation and loneliness. This paper is based on cross-sectional online survey data (available in 10 languages, from 2 June to 16 November 2020) with 20,398 respondents from 101 different countries. It aims to help increase our understanding of the global risk factors that are associated with social isolation and loneliness, irrespective of culture or country, to support evidence-based policy, services and public health interventions. We found the prevalence of severe loneliness was 21% during COVID-19 with 6% retrospectively reporting severe loneliness prior to the pandemic. A fifth were defined as isolated based on their usual connections, with 13% reporting a substantial increase in isolation during COVID-19. Personal finances and mental health were overarching and consistently cross-cutting predictors of loneliness and social isolation, both before and during the pandemic. With the likelihood of future waves of COVID-19 and related restrictions, it must be a public health priority to address the root causes of loneliness and social isolation and, in particular, address the needs of specific groups such as carers or those living alone.","O'Sullivan, Burns, Leavey, Leroi, Burholt, Lubben, Holt-Lunstad, Victor, Lawlor, Vilar-Compte, Perissinotto, Tully, Sullivan, Rosato, Power, Tiilikainen, Prohaska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18199982","20211013","COVID-19; loneliness; public health; risk factors; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18847,""
"Irrational Beliefs about COVID-19: A Scoping Review","Since the emergence of the recent Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, there has been a parallel spread of false and misleading information, known as an infodemic. The COVID-19 infodemic has induced distrust in scientific communities, governments, institutions and the population, and a confidence crisis that has led to harmful health behaviours, also impacting on mental health. The aim of this study is to provide a scoping review of the scientific literature about COVID-19-related misinformation and conspiracy theories, focusing on the construction of a conceptual framework which is useful for the interpretation of the conspiracy theory phenomenon surrounding COVID-19, and its consequences. Particular socio-environmental conditions (i.e., low educational level, younger age), psychological processes and attitudes (such as low levels of epistemic trust, the avoidance of uncertainty, extraversion, collective narcissism, and a conspiracy-prone mindset), and contextual factors (e.g., high levels of self-perceived risk and anxiety) seem to underpin the adherence to beliefs that are not solely the domain of paranoids and extremists but a widespread phenomenon that has caused important health, social and political consequences.","Magarini, Pinelli, Sinisi, Ferrari, De Fazio, Galeazzi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18199839","20211013","COVID-19; conspiracy theories; coronavirus; infodemic; mental health; misinformation; public health; social and public trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","",18848,""
