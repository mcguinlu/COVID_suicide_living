"Assessment of Suicide in Japan During the COVID-19 Pandemic vs Previous Years","Importance: There are concerns that suicide rates may have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objective: To assess whether suicide rates in Japan increased in April through November 2020 compared with previous years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used national data obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare from 2016 to 2020 on the monthly number of individuals who died of suicide in Japan from January to November of 2016 to 2020. Exposure: 2020 vs previous years. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was monthly suicide rates, calculated as the number of individuals who died of suicide divided by the total population. A difference-in-difference regression model was used to estimate the change in monthly suicide rates in April to November 2020 vs these months in 2016 to 2019. Results: Analyses included 90Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯048 individuals (61Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯366 [68.1%] men) who died of suicide from 2016 to 2020. The difference-in-difference analysis of men showed that there was no increase in suicide rates from April through September 2020 compared with these months in 2016 to 2019, but that suicide rates were increased in October (difference-in-difference, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.67] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 population) and November (difference-in-difference, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.60] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 population). Among women, suicide rates in 2020 compared with 2016 to 2019 increased in July (difference-in-difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.38] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 population), August (difference-in-difference, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.45] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 population), September (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 population), October (difference-in-difference, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 population), and November (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 population). In secondary analyses in which the suicide rates of 2020 were compared with the expected rates based on trends from 2011 to 2019, the increases in suicide rates were most pronounced among men aged younger than 30 years (eg, November: observed vs expected rate ratio [RR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.26-1.71]) and women aged younger than 30 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.76 to 2.52]) and 30 to 49 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.30 [95% CI, 2.01 to 2.58]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that compared with previous years, suicide rates in Japan in 2020 increased in October and November for men and in July through November for women.","Sakamoto, Haruka; Ishikane, Masahiro; Ghaznavi, Cyrus; Ueda, Peter","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37378","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(2): e2037378, 2021 Feb 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(2): e2037378, 2021 Feb 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10303,""
"Psychological and psychiatric impact of COVID-19 pandemic among children and adolescents","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreak and the unprecedent measures imposed by the government, including quarantine and social distancing, cause psychological distress in children and adolescents. METHODS: we review literature about mental health effects of COVID-19 pandemic by using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""coronavirus"", ""pandemic"", ""mental health"", ""psych*"", ""adolescent"" and ""child"". RESULTS: early evidence show high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, due to the pandemic itself, to social isolation and to parents' stress. High grade students, females and low-income families are at higher risk to develop psychiatric symptoms. Psychological distress can be reduced by maintaining contact with peers through social networks and by accurate updates provided by the government through the mass media. Online resources such as information about mental health education and preventive measure, video-counselling, telemedicine and telepsychiatry services, can be useful to reduce the psychosocial effects of the novel coronavirus.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Disordered Eating Behavior: Qualitative Analysis of Social Media Posts","BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence is suggesting a significant association between the COVID-19 pandemic and population-level mental health. Study findings suggest that individuals with a lifetime history of disordered eating behavior may be negatively affected by COVID-19-related anxiety, and prevention measures may disrupt daily functioning and limit access to treatment. However, data describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors are limited, and most findings focus on individuals in treatment settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the experiences of Reddit users worldwide who post in eating disorder (ED)-related discussion forums describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their overall mental health and disordered eating behavior. METHODS: Data were collected from popular subreddits acknowledging EDs as their primary discussion topic. Unique discussion posts dated from January 1 to May 31, 2020 that referenced the COVID-19 pandemic were extracted and evaluated using inductive, thematic data analysis. RESULTS: Six primary themes were identified: change in ED symptoms, change in exercise routine, impact of quarantine on daily life, emotional well-being, help-seeking behavior, and associated risks and health outcomes. The majority of users reported that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures negatively impacted their psychiatric health and contributed to increased disordered eating behaviors. Feelings of isolation, frustration, and anxiety were common. Many individuals used Reddit forums to share personal experiences, seek advice, and offer shared accountability. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit discussion forums have provided a therapeutic community for individuals to share experiences and provide support for peers with ED during a period of increased psychiatric distress. Future research is needed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behavior and to evaluate the role of social media discussion forums in mental health treatment, especially during periods of limited treatment access.","Nutley, Sara K; Falise, Alyssa M; Henderson, Rebecca; Apostolou, Vasiliki; Mathews, Carol A; Striley, Catherine W","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26011","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e26011, 2021 Jan 27.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e26011, 2021 Jan 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10305,""
"COVID-19 and Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic Communities: A Complex Relationship Without Just Cause","Emerging evidence has indicated a negative and disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Previous studies have already reported that biological and social risk factors increase disease susceptibility, particularly in BAME communities. Despite frontline workers in ethnic minority communities in the United Kingdom's National Health Service attempting to quell the pandemic, disproportionate numbers of BAME physicians and other health care workers have died of COVID-19. This unprecedented situation highlights ethical and moral implications, which could further augment the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. While the government attempts to mitigate the rate of virus transmission, certain key factors inadvertently augment the negative impact of the pandemic on the mental health and general well-being of BAME communities. This study examined the available literature to explore the association between, and the wider impact of, COVID-19 on BAME communities. Furthermore, this study aims to raise awareness and provide a deeper insight into current scientific discussions.","Phiri, Peter; Delanerolle, Gayathri; Al-Sudani, Ayaat; Rathod, Shanaya","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22581","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(2): e22581, 2021 Feb 01.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(2): e22581, 2021 Feb 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10306,""
"""We Are at Risk Too"": The Disparate Mental Health Impacts of the Pandemic on Younger Generations: Nous Sommes Aussi Ã  Risque: Les Effets Disparates de la PandÃ©mie Sur la SantÃ© Mentale des GÃ©nÃ©rations Plus Jeunes","OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in profound global impact, with older adults at greater risk of serious physical health outcomes. It is essential to also understand generational differences in psychosocial impacts to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviors, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of COVID-related concerns during Wave 1 of COVID-19 in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data from 2 Canadian population-based data sets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N = 4,627; March 29 to April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Your Mental Health (N = 45,989; April 24 to May 11, 2020). MEASURES: We categorized generational age group. Participants self-reported changes in behaviors and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: There are generational differences in behavioral responses to the pandemic. Adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were comparable across groups, while changes in maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger age groups, particularly Millennials (15 to 34 years old). COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X (35 to 54 years old) exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behavior. Results also revealed that the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety is among Millennials (36.0%; severe anxiety = 15.7%), and the younger generations have the highest rates of COVID-related concerns.

"Geographic Distribution of Mental Health Problems Among Chinese College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Nationwide, Web-Based Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 outbreak was first reported, considerable attention has been drawn to mental health problems among college students. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students in different geographical areas of China during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese college students of 16 provinces or municipalities from February 4 to 12, 2020. A web-based survey was adopted to collect information from these college students, including demographics, perceived risk of infection, attitudes toward the epidemic and its control, and mental health status. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage of perceived risk of infection and attitude toward COVID-19 among college students in different geographic locations. Binary logistic models were used to identify associations between geographic locations and mental health problems after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 11,787 participants were analyzed in this study (response rate: 79.7%). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students was 17.8% (95% CI 17.1%-18.5%) and 25.9% (95% CI 25.1%-26.7%), respectively. After controlling for covariates, current residence area in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.68) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.59). Similarly, college location in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.35) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.36). History of residence in or travel to Wuhan city in the past month was also positively associated with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.46-1.80) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.35-1.63). Furthermore, the perceived risk of COVID-19 was higher among students whose college location and current residence area were in Wuhan city, and it was positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems among Chinese college students were widespread and geographically diverse. Our study results provide further insight for policymakers to develop targeted intervention strategies.","Wu, Xiaoyan; Tao, Shuman; Zhang, Yi; Li, Shiyue; Ma, Le; Yu, Yizhen; Sun, Guilong; Li, Tingting; Tao, Fangbiao","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23126","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e23126, 2021 01 29.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e23126, 2021 01 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10308,""
"""Advocating Every Single Day"" so as Not to Be Forgotten: Factors Supporting Resiliency in Adult Day Service Centers Amidst COVID-19-Related Closures","Adult day centers (ADCs) are nonresidential settings that support the health and social needs of vulnerable older adults. Due to ADCs' congregate nature and participants' compromised health status, many ADCs have been forced to close during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown how closures have impacted service delivery at ADCs. Guided by the Resiliency Activation Framework, we (a) identified consequences resulting from closures of ADCs during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) described factors that have enabled the ADC community to remain resilient in the wake of challenges brought on by the pandemic. We conducted 2 focus groups in California (n =Â 12), and individual interviews with ADC staff members (n =Â 8) in 7 other states. The results of a directed content analysis revealed perceived declines in physical, cognitive, and mental health of ADC users and increased caregiver strain. Access to human, social, economic, and political capital were essential for supporting ADCs in buffering the impacts of the pandemic on the older adults they serve but were not consistently available. Research is urgently needed that quantifies the impacts of the pandemic on ADC users and their caregivers to inform policy and advocacy efforts in the wake of the pandemic.","Sadarangani, Tina; Zhong, Jie; Vora, Paayal; Missaelides, Lydia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2021.1879339","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Gerontol Soc Work;: 1-12, 2021 Jan 29.; Publication details: J Gerontol Soc Work;: 1-12, 2021 Jan 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10309,""

"Attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care needs among parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic has generated anxiety and mental health issues in the common population. In general, anxiety and poor health are higher in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) than parents of children without ASD. However, the symptoms of anxiety, depression and poor mental health are likely to be more escalated in parents of children with ASD during COVID-19, possibly due to the emergency measures involving suspension of essential services, closure of schools, work-from-home policy and lack of professional support, etc. AIM: This empirical research aimed to explore the attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care of parents of children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 211 participants, including mothers and fathers of children with ASD from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, participated in this online study. Along with demographic details, data on attitude, anxiety, mental health status and perceived mental health care were obtained using both self-reported questionnaire and reference standard questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using t-test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis. The responses to open-ended questions were also collected and analysed qualitatively. The study revealed that attitudes towards taking care of children with ASD were affected by parents' age and child's age, and mothers were more affected. Further, the anxiety of parents during COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 situation. It was found that parents' mental status during COVID-19 mediated the interaction between anxiety and perceived mental health care. Finally, the open-ended questions indicated that parents sought support from teachers, family members and therapists to deal with children with ASD during the pandemic outbreak. In the context of perceived mental health care, besides psychological and financial support, other measures like training sessions, online classes, etc., were recommended. The findings of this study insisted on the importance of support from government and local health authorities to introduce interventions for parents and children with ASD to improve the overall mental health.","Althiabi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103873","20210204","Anxiety; Attitude; Autism; COVID-19; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Mental health; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10313,""
"Substance use, mental health and weight-related behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in people with obesity","Studies have shown the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on mental health and substance use in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic onsubstance use, mental health and weight-related behaviors in a sample of adults with obesity after lockdown orders were lifted (June-September 2020). A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from one university-based obesity medicine clinic, and two metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) practices. Patients who completed an online survey from June 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 were included. The primary outcome measure was substance use (various drugs, alcohol, tobacco). Substance use and mental health survey questions were based on standardized, validated instruments. A total of 589 patients (83.3% female, mean age 53.6 years [SD 12.8], mean BMI 35.4 [SD 9.1], 54.5% Non-Hispanic white, 22.3% post-MBS) were included. Seventeen patients (2.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 13.5% reported symptoms. Nearly half (48.4%) of the sample reported recreational substance use and 9.8% reported increased use since the start of the pandemic. There was substantial drug use reported (24.3% opioids, 9.5% sedative/tranquilizers, 3.6% marijuana, and 1% stimulants). Patients who reported stockpiling food more (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.03-2.18), healthy eating more challenging (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.16), difficulty falling asleep (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.14-2.34), and anxiety (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.14) were more likely to report substance use versus non-users.

The study found that the pandemic did not affect all groups of society uniformly, rather the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as economic status and family institutions. The lower socioeconomic class is the worst affected as the pandemic made them unemployed, leading them to an uncertain future. Despite such variations, the general population has experienced a subsequent increase in workload, and challenges in using routine health facilities that increased behavioural changes, higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and suicides.","Ahmed, Sifat","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3121","20210204","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10315,""
"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Prevalence of Stress and Worry, Mental Health Conditions, and Increased Substance Use Among Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, April and May 2020","In 2019, approximately 51 million U.S. adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years reported any mental illness,* and 7.7% reported a past-year substance use disorder<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup> (1). Although reported prevalence estimates of certain mental disorders, substance use, or substance use disorders are not generally higher among racial and ethnic minority groups, persons in these groups are often less likely to receive treatment services (1). Persistent systemic social inequities and discrimination related to living conditions and work environments, which contribute to disparities in underlying medical conditions, can further compound health problems faced by members of racial and ethnic minority groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and worsen stress and associated mental health concerns (2,3). In April and May 2020, opt-in Internet panel surveys of English-speaking U.S. adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years were conducted to assess the prevalence of self-reported mental health conditions and initiation of or increases in substance use to cope with stress, psychosocial stressors, and social determinants of health. Combined prevalence estimates of current depression, initiating or increasing substance use, and suicidal thoughts/ideation were 28.6%, 18.2%, and 8.4%, respectively. Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) adults reported a higher prevalence of psychosocial stress related to not having enough food or stable housing than did adults in other racial and ethnic groups. These estimates highlight the importance of population-level and tailored interventions for mental health promotion and mental illness prevention, substance use prevention, screening and treatment services, and increased provision of resources to address social determinants of health.

"Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System peptide profiles in patients with COVID-19","Objective While evidence on the interface between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is accumulating, clinical data on RAAS peptide alteration among coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients is missing. Design and Methods In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs. 66.8pmol/l, -52.7% [95%CI -68.5% to -36.9%]; angiotensin II: 37.7 vs. 92.5pmol/l, -59.2% [95%CI -72.1% to -46.3%]; angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs. 6.6pmol/l, -49.7% [95%CI -59.2% to -40.2%]; angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs. 7.6pmol/l, -64.9% [95%CI -84.5% to -45.3%]). While the plasma renin activity (PRA-S) was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs. 207.9pmol/l, -58.5% [95%CI -71.4% to -45.6%]), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","Kutz, Conen, Gregoriano, Haubitz, Koch, Domening, Bernasconi, Mueller, Schuetz","https://doi.org/10.1530/EJE-20-1445","20210204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10317,""
"Increasing Short- and Long-Term Buprenorphine Treatment Capacity: Providing Waiver Training for Medical Students","In the face of an ongoing opioid crisis in the United States, persistent treatment gaps exist for vulnerable populations. Among the 3 Food and Drug Administration-approved medications used to treat opioid use disorder, many patients prefer buprenorphine. But physicians are currently required to register with the Drug Enforcement Administration and complete 8 hours of qualifying training before they can receive a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to their patients. In this article, the authors summarize the evolution of buprenorphine waiver training in undergraduate medical education and outline 2 potential paths to increase buprenorphine treatment capacity going forward: the curriculum change approach and the training module approach. As part of the 2018 Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has provided funding for medical schools to adapt their curricula to meet waiver-training requirements. To date, however, only one school has had its curriculum approved for this purpose. Additionally, recent political efforts have been directed at eliminating aspects of the waiver training requirement and creating a more direct path to integrating waiver qualification into undergraduate medical education. Other medical schools have adopted a more pragmatic approach involving the integration of existing online, in-person, and hybrid waiver-qualifying training modules into the curricula, generally for fourth-year students. This training module approach can be more rapidly, broadly, and cost-effectively implemented than the curriculum change approach. It can also be easily integrated into the online medical curricula that schools developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately both curricular changes and support for student completion of existing training modules should be pursued in concert, but focus should not be single-mindedly on the former at the expense of the latter.","Stokes, Perrone","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003968","20210204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10318,""
"Improving adult coping with social isolation during COVID-19 in the community through nurse-led patient-centered telehealth teaching and listening interventions","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to social isolation which both threatens mental health and has been shown to increase the risk for early death by 50%, and to contribute to increased rates of heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and inflammation. No identified special programs to address loneliness related to social isolation were in place. This project aimed to improve adult coping with COVID-19 in the community to 80% over 8 weeks. Three interventions were implemented concurrently and studied through Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. Each cycle started with a test of change, followed by data collection and analysis using run charts, aggregate data tables, and field notes. This analysis guided the design of new tests of change for each intervention in the following cycle. Iterative changes were introduced through four cycles over 8th weeks. These included a data-gathering survey, a telehealth teach-back tool and a telehealth listening tool. All interventions were implemented remotely through telehealth contacts. The project engaged 44 participants and successfully addressed loneliness by creating a social connection with 100% of participants and 82% of participants learned something new. Telehealth interventions hardwired to be patient-centered can provide isolated populations with meaningful social contact.","Ross, Meier","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12552","20210204","patient-centered care; social isolation; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10319,""

"Potential False-Positive and False-Negative Results for COVID-19 IgG/IgM Antibody Testing After Heat-Inactivation","<b>Objectives:</b> With the worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), various antibody detection kits have been developed to test for SARS-CoV-2- specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody. However, the use of different testing methods under various heat-inactivation conditions might affect the COVID-19 detection results. <b>Methods:</b> Seven different antibody detection kits produced by four manufacturers for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and total antibody were tested at Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, China. Most of the kits used the indirect immunity, capture, and double-antigen sandwich methods. The effects of various heat-inactivation conditions on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody detection were analyzed for the different test methods. <b>Results:</b> Using the indirect immunity method, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody significantly increased and those for IgM antibody decreased with increasing temperature of heat-inactivation using indirect immunity method. However, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and total antibody showed no change when the capture and double-antigen sandwich methods were used. The changes in IgG and IgM antibody values with the indirect immunity method indicated that heat-inactivation could affect COVID-19 detection results obtained using this method. In particular, 18 (22.2%) SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive samples were detected as negative with heat-inactivation at 65Ã‚Â°C for 30 min, and one (25%) IgG negative sample was detected as positive after heat-inactivation at 56Ã‚Â°C for 60 min and 60Ã‚Â°C for 30 min. <b>Conclusions:</b> Heat-inactivation could increase SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody values, and decrease IgM antibody values, causing potential false-positive or false-negative results for COVID-19 antibody detection using the indirect immunity method. Thus, before conducting antibody testing, the testing platforms should be evaluated in accordance with the relevant requirements to ensure accurate COVID-19 detection results.","Lin, Dai, Li, Xiao, Luo, Guo, Yang, Han, Zhu, Wu, He, Wu, Xia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.589080","20210204","COVID-19; IgG and IgM antibody; SARS-CoV-2; heat-inactivation; indirect immunity method","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10321,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health of Vulnerable Two Groups: Developmental Trauma of the Child-Adolescents and Work Disaster of Health Care Workers","COVID-19 has spread worldwide. People are struggling to adjust to a new normal, but changes in their daily routines are also causing stress. A person may feel depressed, uneasy, or suicidal and may complain of symptoms such as panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disease (PTSD), psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or paranoia when personal resilience cannot effectively process the stress. Children, adolescents, and health care workers are especially psychologically vulnerable groups in the pandemic calamity situation; therefore, a long-term intervention plan is necessary for them. When intervening with children and adolescents, it should be considered that each individual has different ways of expressing stress according to the developmental level of cognition, language, and emotion, and taking into account these developmental levels, it is necessary to help them achieve developmental tasks appropriate for their age. Health care workers feel psychological pain from problems such as the risk of becoming infected, the risk of passing the virus to their families, overwork, isolation, and stigma. Therefore, it is necessary to help them recover themselves by supplying personal protective equipment and providing the most basic resources necessary for adequate rest, work-life balance, and childcare.","Nam, Yang","https://doi.org/10.4068/cmj.2021.57.1.7","20210204","Adverse Childhood Experiences; COVID-19; Health Personnel; Mental Health; Psychosocial Support Systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10322,""
"A Key Factor for Psychosomatic Burden of Frontline Medical Staff: Occupational Pressure During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China","The global outbreak of COVID-19 has severely affected the entire population, especially healthcare staff on the frontline, who bear heavy psychosomatic burdens. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 723 participants in China from April 26 to May 9, 2020. We evaluated the psychosomatic status, including depression, anxiety, quality of life, somatic symptoms, stress, sleep disturbances, and posttraumatic stress symptoms in different exposure groups. We explored the risk factors that affect psychosomatic burdens and analyzed the relationship between psychosomatic problems and medical occupations. We found that the psychosomatic burdens of medical staff were significantly greater than those of non-medical staff (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and were positively related with the number of COVID-19 patients they came in contact with. Occupational pressure was a key factor for healthcare staff's psychosomatic problems (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01 for quality of life, somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, stress; <i>p</i> = 0.012 for sleep disturbances), and it had a strong canonical correlation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Workload and time allocation (WTA), one of the subdimensional indicators of occupational pressure, was strongly correlated with psychosomatic indicators. We suggest that rationalization of WTA is a desirable approach for anti-epidemic medical employees to alleviate psychosomatic burdens. Public health interventions should be undertaken to reduce the occupational pressure on this special population, which is critical for mitigation. This study presents results regarding the psychosomatic burdens of the healthcare workforce related to occupational pressure and provides multilevel data with groups of different exposure risks for policymakers to protect medical personnel. These findings draw attention to the working environments of healthcare workers and provide applicable results for clinical practice.","Yi, Kang, Li, Gu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.590101","20210204","COVID-19; medical staff; occupational health; psychosomatic health; risk factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10323,""

Of 7230 adults hospitalized for COVID-19, 345 patients (4.8%) received an antidepressant within 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°h of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics, clinical and biological markers of disease severity, and other psychotropic medications. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting. This analysis showed a significant association between antidepressant use and reduced risk of intubation or death (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.73, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Exploratory analyses suggest that this association was also significant for SSRI and non-SSRI antidepressants, and for fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). These results suggest that antidepressant use could be associated with lower risk of death or intubation in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of antidepressant medications for COVID-19 are needed.","Hoertel, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Rico, Vernet, Beeker, Jannot, Neuraz, Salamanca, Paris, Daniel, Gramfort, Lemaitre, Bernaux, Bellamine, Lemogne, Airagnes, Burgun, Limosin","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01021-4","20210204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10324,""
"COVID-19-related psychological distress and engagement in preventative behaviors among individuals with severe mental illnesses","Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) may be disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and psychological distress. This study investigated the prevalence of engagement in COVID-19 preventative behaviors, predictors of these behaviors, and COVID-19-related psychological distress. One hundred and sixty-three individuals with SMIs (94 with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses and 69 with affective disorders) and 27 psychiatrically healthy comparison participants were recruited from ongoing studies across 3 sites, to complete a phone survey querying implementation of 8 specific COVID-19 preventative behaviors that participants engaged in at least once in the past month as well as standard assessments of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, loneliness, and coping. Data were collected between 3 April 2020 and 4 June 2020. The large majority of our SMI sample, which consisted of outpatients with relatively mild symptom severity, endorsed engaging in multiple preventative behaviors. Relatively few differences were found between groups; however, individuals with SMI were less likely to work remotely than healthy individuals and individuals with schizophrenia spectrum illness were less likely to stay home as a preventative measure, wear face masks, and work remotely than individuals with affective disorders. Differences in staying home remained after controlling for potential confounds. Although individuals with SMI reported more psychological distress related to COVID-19, this distress was largely unrelated to engagement in preventative behaviors. The large majority of individuals with SMI in this outpatient sample, regardless of broad diagnostic category, reported performing multiple behaviors intended to prevent COVID-19 infection at least once a month and reported distress associated with the pandemic. These findings suggest a good level of awareness of COVID-19 among stable outpatients with SMI. The degree to which more acutely ill persons with SMI engage in such preventative behaviors, however, remains to be examined.","Pinkham, Ackerman, Depp, Harvey, Moore","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41537-021-00136-5","20210204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10325,""
"Overview of Tertiary Addictions Services response to Opioid dependence during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has presented the addiction services with an unprecedented set of challenges. Opioid users are particularly vulnerable because of their high level of pre-existing health problems and lifestyle factors. In order to minimise their risks to self and to others in the current Covid-19 crisis, the service has sought to urgently identify vulnerable individuals, and induct them into OST treatment promptly. Additionally, several guidelines have been created and regularly updated by the HSE for any healthcare staff working with opioid users. These include guidance documents, to facilitate prompt induction of patients onto the OST programme, the prescribing of naloxone to all patients at risk of overdose, eConsultation, medication management for those in self-isolation, and the delivery of injecting equipment. The guidance documents and resources will provide a template for a new way of working for the sector during these challenging times and into the future.","Hennigan, Corrigan, Killeen, Keenan, Scully","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.8","20210204","COVID 19; addiction; dependence; drug; opioid; substitution","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10326,""
"Development and rapid evaluation of services to support the physical health of people using psychiatric inpatient units during the COVID-19 pandemic: study protocol","People diagnosed with a serious mental illness have worse physical health and lower life expectancy than the general population. Integration of mental and physical health services is seen as one service development that could better support this. This protocol describes the evaluation of the provision of a Virtual Physical Health Clinic (VPHC) and Consultant Connect (CC) services to one UK-based mental health Trust. Prospective, formative, pragmatic evaluation using both quantitative and qualitative techniques and driven by implementation science theoretical frameworks. The VPHC and CC are described along with the methodology being used to rapidly evaluate their implementation, effectiveness and potential economic impact in order to inform future roll out. We will assess the implementation process through quantitative data on uptake and reach and through self-reported data to be collected from interviews and the use of validated implementation outcome assessment measures. We will assess implementation strategies using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) strategies as a framework. We will assess the health economic impact of both services using established health economic methods including cost comparison scenarios and health service utilisation analyses. Supporting the physical health management of people in psychiatric inpatient units is important in improving the physical health of this population. Integration of mental and physical health can help this to happen effectively. This initiative provides one of the first service evaluation protocols of its kind to be reported in the UK at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Williams, Fairbairn, McGrath, Clark, Healey, Bakolis, Gaughran, Sadler, Khadjesari, Sevdalis, Lillywhite, McMullen, Reddy, Shields","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00113-0","20210204","Cost-effectiveness; Effectiveness; Evaluation; Implementation; Integration; Physical health; Serious mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10327,""
"An investigation of depression, anxiety, and stress and its relating factors during COVID-19 pandemic in Iran","The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging epidemic caused by the new Coronavirus. It has affected more than 200 countries, infected 5,939,234 people, and killed 367,255 in the world until 1 June 2020. While the disease epidemic could affect population mental health, this study aimed to investigate stress, anxiety, and depression during the Corona pandemic in Iran. An online survey was designed using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. The questionnaire was available for all Iranian population from 18 to 28 April 2020. Finally, 1498 participants filled the questionnaire using snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression models. Findings showed that most participants had experienced a normal level of stress (36.6%), anxiety (57.9%) and depression (47.9%). About 2.5% of respondents report an extremely severe level of stress. This amount of anxiety and depression was 6.3 and 7.9%, respectively. Regression model showed being female (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.299; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.248), living with a high risk family member (CI: 0.325; 1.400), health status (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.857; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.595), economic status (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.396; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.141), social capital (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.475; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.244), risk of disease (CI: 0.081; 0.729), and following COVID-19 news (CI: 0.111; 0.551) have a relation with stress level. Education level (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.252; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017), living with a high risk family member (CI: 0.0301; 1.160), health status (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.682; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.471), social capital (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.236; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.048), risk of disease (CI: 0.154; 0.674), and following COVID-19 news (CI: 0.046; 0.401) have a relation with anxiety score. Depression score was in relation with education level (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.263; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.022), having a high-risk family member (CI: 0.292; 1.155), health status (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.687; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.476), social capital (CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.235; -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.048), risk of disease (CI: 0.144; 0.667), and following Covid-19 news (CI: 0.053; 0.408). Most of the factors related to depression, anxiety, and stress are related to COVID-19, such as having a vulnerable person in the family, risk of disease, and following COVID-19 news. The findings suggest the factors that should be taken into consideration for improving population mental health during pandemics.","Khademian, Delavari, Koohjani, Khademian","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10329-3","20210204","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronovirus; Depression; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10328,""
"Interprofessional primary care during COVID-19: a survey of the provider perspective","Interprofessional primary care (IPC) teams provide comprehensive and coordinated care and are ideally equipped to support those populations most at risk of adverse health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, including older adults, and patients with chronic physical and mental health conditions. There has been little focus on the experiences of healthcare teams and no studies have examined IPC practice during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of the study was to describe the state of interprofessional health provider practice within IPC teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observational cross-sectional design. A web-based survey was deployed to IPC providers working in team-based primary care clinics in the province of Ontario, Canada. The survey included 26 close-ended and six open-ended questions. Close-ended questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Content analysis was used to analyze the open-ended questions. 445 surveys were included in the final analysis. Service delivery shifted from in-person care (77% pre-COVID-19) to telephone (76.5% during the COVID-19 pandemic). Less than half of the respondents (40%) reported receiving any training for virtual delivery. Wait times to access team members were reported to have decreased. There has also been a shift in what IPC providers report as the most commonly seen conditions, with increases in visits related to mental health concerns, acute infections (including COVID-19), social isolation, and resource navigation. Respondents also reported a reduction in healthcare provision for multiple chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic pain. IPC teams are rapidly shifting their practice to supporting their patients during the pandemic. A surge in mental health issues has been seen and is expected to continue to increase in response to COVID-19. Understanding early experiences can help plan for future pandemic waves.","Donnelly, Ashcroft, Bobbette, Mills, Mofina, Tran, Vader, Williams, Gill, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01366-9","20210204","COVID-19; Primary care teams; interprofessional primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10329,""
"'Online therapy' to reduce caregiver's distress and to stimulate post-severe acquired brain injury motor and cognitive recovery: A Sicilian hospital experience in the COVID era","Severe acquired brain injury(SABI) often results in the deterioration of physical, cognitive and emotional functions in the patient and a significant caregiver's distress syndrome, which is now amplified by the social isolation, depression and financial difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of web-based online-therapy has been shown to be useful to overcome caregiver's distress syndrome and further stimulate cognitive-motor recovery of SABI-patients. Our study aimed to investigate whether a systematic online Skype-therapy(OLST) may be of support in favoring global cognitive and sensory-motor recovery in SABI-patients and reducing caregiver distress. Twenty-five SABI-subjects in inpatient regimen were provided with intensive OLST with the caregiver for 12 weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Each subject and caregiver was evaluated before and after the treatment by administering an ad hoc battery. Furthermore, 18 of 27 patients were provided with EEG recording in resting state. We found a significant reduction in caregiver's anxiety (p&lt;0.0001) and burden(p&lt;0.0001). Patients showed significant improvement in trunk control (p&lt;0.0001), functional independence (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005), functional (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and global communication (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), cognitive functioning (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and behavioral responsiveness (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0004). The training yielded a significant connectivity change within the fronto-centro-parietal areas in the delta frequency band (p&lt;0.0001) and the centro-parieto-occipital areas in the alpha range (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004). OLST may be a useful and complementary treatment to optimize global cognitive and functional recovery in SABI-subjects and reduce caregivers' concerns in the Covid-era. OLST can foster cognitive-motor recovery potentially by favoring the plasticity-dependent functional recovery. Therefore, OLST could be proposed as a tool allowing social conversations also in the hospital setting.","De Luca, Rifici, Pollicino, Di Cara, Miceli, Sergi, Sorrenti, Romano, Naro, Billeri, Lauria, Caminiti, Bramanti, Torrisi","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X21990195","20210204","Online web-based therapy; caregiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distress; cognitive and functional recovery; psychological well-being, COVID-19.; severe acquired brain injury (SABI)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10330,""
"Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict People's Intention to Use Mobile Learning Platforms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach","Mobile learning has become an essential instruction platform in many schools, colleges, universities, and various other educational institutions across the globe, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide. This study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions. An extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students' adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey. Based on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable. Our study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.","Akour, Alshurideh, Al Kurdi, Al Ali, Salloum","https://doi.org/10.2196/24032","20210204","COVID-19; behavior; fear; intent; machine learning; mobile learning; online learning; pandemic; prediction; technology acceptance model; theory of planned behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-05","",10331,""
