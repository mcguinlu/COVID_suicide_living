"The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19-related deaths: An application to three French cities","Being heavily dependent to oil products (mainly gasoline and diesel), the French transport sector is the main emitter of Particulate Matter (PMs) whose critical levels induce harmful health effects for urban inhabitants  We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution  Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM2 5 and PM10 linked to COVID-19-related deaths  Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic  The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection  The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology  In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM2 5 and PM10 connected to COVID-19: 17 4 Âµg/m3 (PM2 5) and 29 6 Âµg/m3 (PM10) for Paris;15 6 Âµg/m3 (PM2 5) and 20 6 Âµg/m3 (PM10) for Lyon;14 3 Âµg/m3 (PM2 5) and 22 04 Âµg/m3 (PM10) for Marseille  Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament  Finally, a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm is applied to check the consistency of our findings","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115835","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Applied Energy;2020.; Publication details: Applied Energy;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4766,""

"COVID-19 Pandemic's precautionary measures had hit the reset button of the quality of life at different aspects","COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan-China during the last quarter in 2019 and caused an infectious respiratory disease pandemic. The strategy of ""Attack and Defend"" was attempted to mitigate COVID-19 crisis worldwide. A list of precautionary measures were set by healthcare professional experts to protect public from infection, social physical distancing measures being the most efficient. On the other hand, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established protective guidelines for healthcare workers to guarantee a healthy workplace and safe environment. The physical distancing measures have obviously reshaped the relationship between family members leading to better quality of family life. Meanwhile, travel suspension also led to slightly higher health standards with less air pollution, lower traffic induced stress levels and subsequently a greener footprint. Herein, we intend to highlight the impact of COVID-19 pandemic protective measures on family connections, as well as on environmental health. Moreover, we aimed at pointing out the effect on Saudi Arabian cultural and humanitarian behavior in dealing with the pandemic under the governance care of the custodian of the two holy mosques; King Salman Al-Saud. In fact, a combination of restrictive and protective measures is the most efficient to curb COVID-19 spread. In addition to improving the quality of social life, this pandemic revealed a healthier climate, which will certainly be visible on a large scale. Certainly, all together with solidarity we will be able to restrain COVID-19 pandemic and have a better quality of life.","Alsayedahmed, Huda H","https://dx.doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12943","","Country: IT; ITÃLIA; ITALY; ITALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Infect Dev Ctries;14(8): 812-816, 2020 Aug 31.; Publication details: J Infect Dev Ctries;14(8): 812-816, 2020 Aug 31.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4803,""
"Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with Personality Disorders: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to May 2020","The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a widespread impact on mental healthcare for both services themselves and the people accessing those services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was a 28% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March.","Eleanor Nuzum; Evangelia Martin; Matthew Broadbent; Robert Stewart; Hector Serna-secundino; Cristina Aguilar; Jose Garcia-Olanzaran; Diana Hernandez-Garcia; Emma Jones; Michael Usher; Jeffrey Chipman; R.

"Using Machine Learning to Generate Novel Hypotheses: Increasing Optimism About COVID-19 Makes People Less Willing to Justify Unethical Behaviors","How can we nudge people to not engage in unethical behaviors, such as hoarding and violating social-distancing guidelines, during the COVID-19 pandemic? Because past research on antecedents of unethical behavior has not provided a clear answer, we turned to machine learning to generate novel hypotheses. We trained a deep-learning model to predict whether or not World Values Survey respondents perceived unethical behaviors as justifiable, on the basis of their responses to 708 other items. The model identified optimism about the future of humanity as one of the top predictors of unethicality. A preregistered correlational study (<i>N</i> = 218 U.S. residents) conceptually replicated this finding. A preregistered experiment (<i>N</i> = 294 U.S. residents) provided causal support: Participants who read a scenario conveying optimism about the COVID-19 pandemic were less willing to justify hoarding and violating social-distancing guidelines than participants who read a scenario conveying pessimism. The findings suggest that optimism can help reduce unethicality, and they document the utility of machine-learning methods for generating novel hypotheses.","Sheetal, Feng, Savani","https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620959594","20200914","COVID-19; machine learning; neural network; open data; open materials; optimism; preregistered; unethical behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4805,""
"Rapid Increase in Telemental Health Within the Department of Veterans Affairs During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> The use of telemental health via videoconferencing (TMH-V) became critical during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to restriction of non-urgent in-person appointments. The current brief report demonstrates the rapid growth in TMH-V appointments in the weeks following the pandemic declaration within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the largest healthcare system in the United States. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> COVID-19 changes in TMH-V appointments were captured during the six weeks following the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration (March 11, 2020-April 22, 2020). Pre-COVID-19 TMH-V encounters were assessed from October 1, 2017 to March 10, 2020. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Daily TMH-V encounters rose from 1,739 on March 11 to 11,406 on April 22 (556% growth, 222,349 total encounters). Between March 11-April 22, 114,714 patients were seen via TMH-V, and 77.5% were first-time TMH-V users. 12,342 MH providers completed a TMH-V appointment between March 11-April 22, and 34.7% were first-time TMH-V users. The percentage growth of TMH-V appointments was higher than the rise in telephone appointments (442% growth); in-person appointments dropped by 81% during this time period. <b> <i>Discussion and Conclusions:</i> </b> The speed of VA's growth in TMH-V appointments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic was facilitated by its pre-existing telehealth infrastructure, including earlier national efforts to increase the number of providers using TMH-V. Longstanding barriers to TMH-V implementation were lessened in the context of a pandemic, during which non-urgent in-person MH care was drastically reduced. Future work is necessary to understand the extent to which COVID-19 related changes in TMH-V use may permanently impact mental health care provision.","Connolly, Stolzmann, Heyworth, Weaver, Bauer, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0233","20200914","behavioral health; psychiatry; psychology; telehealth; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4806,""
"Methotrexate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 virus replication &quot;in vitro&quot;","In early 2020 the new respiratory syndrome COVID-19 (caused by the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 virus) spread like a pandemic, starting from Wuhan, China, causing a severe economic depression. Despite some advances in drug treatments of medical complications in later stages of the disease, the pandemic's death toll is tragic, since no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is currently available. By using a systems approach, we identify the host-encoded pathway, which provides ribonucleotides to viral RNA synthesis, as a possible target. We show that methotrexate, an FDA-approved inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, potently inhibits viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus release. The effective antiviral methotrexate concentrations are similar to those used for established human therapies using the same drug. Methotrexate should be most effective in patients at the earliest appearance of symptoms to effectively prevent viral replication, diffusion of the infection, and possibly fatal complications.

"Insight into the changing patterns in clinical and academic activities of the orthopedic residents during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge to the orthopedic residency training programs to adapt to a form of a web-based learning process and simulation-based training. This study focusses on the viewpoint of the orthopedic residents to the paradigm shift in clinical care as well as the academic activities. An anonymous questionnaire was created in an online survey generator and was sent through e-mail to 227 orthopedic residents of seven tertiary care centres in North India. The questionnaire was divided into three sections, academic activity section, mental health section, and clinical activity section. There were a total of 44 single answer questions with answers according to the increasing difficulty at present situation compared to a previous time before the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 158 questionnaires were filled by 107 junior residents (67.7%) and 51 senior residents (32.3%). 49 residents (31%) were quarantined and three became positive for COVID-19. Although all of them knew about necessary precautions, personal protective equipment was difficult to avail at times. Increased difficulty in recruiting new patients for research (48.9%) and conducting prospective research (48.7%) was observed. The online-based learning process was reported to be easier (44.2%) by most of the residents. Routine clinical work in the operating room, out-patient department, and inpatient department was found to be difficult according to the majority of the residents along with the anxiety of contracting the infection. There are unique opportunities for improvement of residency programs during these times of uncertainty and the findings of this study can help the universities as well as program chairs to develop a robust program that can outlive this pandemic. The web-based learning process might prove to be useful and can be incorporated into the resident training program in the long term.

"Novel stretching and strength-building exercise recommendations for computer-based workers during the COVID-19 quarantine","Prolonged home stays due to the COVID-19 quarantine can increase the use of computers and other technologies that may lead to significant reduction in activity, contributing to musculoskeletal problems, anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to develop a novel multicomponent exercise program for individuals who work with computers during the COVID-19 quarantine. Researchers collaborating cross-institutionally and cross-nationally performed a careful literature search for exercise and stretching regiments with particular attention to methodologies that can be applied during the lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodologies were then compiled and truncated for ease of use for the computer-based office worker during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine. The resulting program is broken down into three categories: aerobic, strengthening and stretching components. Each component can then be further modified to meet the frequency, intensity, time and type (FITT) specifications for the participant. We present a novel, evidence-based strategy for functional fitness for office workers who have remained home-bound during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine. Further research should seek to validate the efficacy of the proposed protocol.","Shariat, Ghannadi, Anastasio, Rostad, Cleland","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-203220","20200914","COVID-19; Office; fitness; musculoskeletal pain; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4809,""
"The role of Yoga in working from home during the COVID-19 global lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major cause of stress and anxiety worldwide. Due to the global lockdown, work, employment, businesses and the economic climate have been severely affected. It has generated stress among people from all sections of society, especially to workers who have been assigned to cater to healthcare service or those constrained to secure daily essential items. It is widely perceived that elderly or those affected by diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases are prone to COVID-19. As per an ongoing survey, the initial data shows that the above-mentioned anxiety and stress cause insomnia, and has the considerable potential to weaken the immune system, the sole protection against the virus. This study focuses on the need of Yoga practice at work places and at home during the global lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature was searched using PubMed and Google Scholar for COVID-19-related stress and anxiety at work and society due to the worldwide lockdown. The predisposing comorbidities, viral mechanism of action and treatment regimen were also searched. Yoga-based intervention studies and online programs were also searched. As the lockdown cannot last forever and workplaces will have to be functional soon, there is an increased possibility of recurrent infection. Therefore, Yoga can provide the necessary tool for risk reduction, amelioration of stress and anxiety and strengthening of the immune function. The online platforms provide a good media for Yoga training at work places and homes. Due to social distancing norms, the availability of Yoga trainers has become restricted. Yoga practice is actively sought to achieve reduced anxiety and stress so that improved sleep may positively impact immunity. As a consequence, there is a spurt in social media, catering to daily online Yoga sessions which apparently prove useful in providing accessible means to achieve mental as well as physical well-being.","Sharma, Anand, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-203219","20200914","COVID-19; Insomnia; Yoga; anxiety; immunity; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4810,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychological Distress, Physical Activity, and Symptom Severity in Parkinson's Disease","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has many consequences for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Social distancing measures complicate regular care and result in lifestyle changes, which may indirectly cause psychological stress and worsening of PD symptoms. To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased psychological distress and decreased physical activity in PD, how these changes related to PD motor and non-motor symptom severity, and what frequency and burden of COVID-related stressors were. We sent an online survey to the Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) cohort (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 498 PD patients) in the Netherlands. In the survey, we distinguished between COVID-related stressor load, psychological distress, PD symptom severity, and physical activity. We related inter-individual differences to personality factors and clinical factors collected before the pandemic occurred. 358 PD patients completed the survey between April 21 and May 25, 2020 (response rate 71.9%). Patients with higher COVID-related stressor load experienced more PD symptoms, and this effect was mediated by the degree of psychological distress. 46.6% of PD patients were less physically active since the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced physical activity correlated with worse PD symptoms. Symptoms that worsened most were rigidity, fatigue, tremor, pain and concentration. Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression) before the pandemic, as well as cognitive dysfunction and several personality traits predicted increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show how an external stressor (the COVID-19 pandemic) leads to a worsening of PD symptoms by evoking psychological distress as well as lifestyle changes (reduced physical activity).","van der Heide, Meinders, Bloem, Helmich","https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202251","20200914","COVID-19; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; psychological distress; surveys and questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4811,""
"COVID-19: Review of a 21st Century Pandemic from Etiology to Neuro-psychiatric Implications","COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease that has claimed &gt;150,000 lives and infected millions in the United States thus far, especially the elderly population. Emerging evidence has shown the virus to cause hemorrhagic and immunologic responses, which impact all organs, including lungs, kidneys, and the brain, as well as extremities. SARS-CoV-2 also affects patients', families', and society's mental health at large. There is growing evidence of re-infection in some patients. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, its mechanism of infection, diagnostics, therapeutics, and treatment strategies, while also focusing on less attended aspects by previous studies, including nutritional support, psychological, and rehabilitation of the pandemic and its management. We performed a systematic review of &gt;1,000 articles and included 425 references from online databases, including, PubMed, Google Scholar, and California Baptist University's library. COVID-19 patients go through acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, acute hypercoagulable state, and autonomic dysfunction, which must be managed by a multidisciplinary team including nursing, nutrition, and rehabilitation. The elderly population and those who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia related illnesses seem to be at the higher risk. There are 28 vaccines under development, and new treatment strategies/protocols are being investigated. The future management for COVID-19 should include B-cell and T-cell immunotherapy in combination with emerging prophylaxis.

However, we found not all Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were afraid of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we investigated the association between rate of awareness of COVID-19 and depressive tendency in AD. 126 consecutive outpatients with AD were enrolled in this study from May 25, on the day when the declaration of emergency was lifted in Japan, through June 30, 2020. In addition to routine psychological tests, the participants were asked the following two questions: &quot;Do you know COVID-19?&quot; and &quot;Why are you wearing a face mask?&quot;. Moderate to severe AD patients were found to have a low COVID-19 recognition rate and did not fully understand why they were wearing face masks. In addition, because they did not understand the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, their Geriatric Depression Scale scores were also substantially lower. These results may appear to simply indicate that people with severe dementia are unaware of current events. However, these results provide insights into how to care for patients with dementia and how to allocate the time and support of our limited staff during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Tsugawa, Sakurai, Inagawa, Hirose, Kaneko, Ogawa, Serisawa, Takenoshita, Sakurai, Kanetaka, Hirao, Shimizu","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200832","20200914","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; COVID-19; dementia; dementia care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4813,""
"Increased internet searches for insomnia as a sensitive indicator for global mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Real-time global mental health surveillance is an urgent need for tracking the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to use Google Trends data to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the population mental health through three keyword searches indicating the varied extent of mental distress, namely insomnia, depression, and suicide. We estimated the increase of search queries for each country by the actual daily search value from March 20 to April 19, 2020, higher than the 95% confidence intervals of the forecast from the three-month baseline via autoregressive integrated moving average modelling. We examined the correlation between the increase of COVID-19 deaths and the number of days with significant increased search volumes for insomnia, depression, and suicide among 19 countries. The countries with the greatest increases in searches for insomnia were Iran, Spain, the United States, and Italy, and these countries showed a significant increase in insomnia searches more than 10 of the 31 days observed. The number of increased death cases was positively correlated to the number of days with an increased search for insomnia among the 19 countries, with the Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.64, P = 0.003. By contrast, there was no significant correlation between increased death cases and increased searches for depression (rho = -0.12, P = 0.633) or suicide (rho = -0.07, P = 0.788). Our analysis suggests that insomnia could be a part of routine screening for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lin, Chiang, Lin","https://doi.org/10.2196/22181","20200914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4814,""
"Self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures among 3035 Chinese factory workers at the beginning of work resumption following COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional online survey","Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve the balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption. This study investigated self-reported compliance with four personal preventive measures against COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent facemask wearing in any public spaces (workplace and other public settings), sanitizing hands using soaps/liquid soaps/alcohol-based hand rubs after returning from public spaces/touching public installations/equipment, avoiding meal/social gathering and avoiding crowded places. We also examined the effects of factors including socio-demographics, individual-level factors (knowledge, perception, and depressive symptoms), interpersonal-level factors (exposure to COVID-19 specific information through different media), and social structural-level factors (preventive measures implemented by the factories). Participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. Fourteen out of 100 factories that had resumed work were randomly selected. All full-time employees aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete an online survey. A designated coordinator responsible for COVID-19 control in each factory facilitated the data collection. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the online survey during March 1-14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. Among participants, 96.8% (n=2,938) and 98.7% (n=2,996) reported wearing a facemask every time in the workplace and in other public settings in the past month, respectively. However, self-reported sanitizing hands (70.9%, n=2,152), avoiding social/meal gathering (73.3%, n=2,225) and avoiding crowded places (65.8%, n=1,997) were relatively low. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, at the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.16-1.29), perceived risk (AOR: 0.58-0.85) and severity (AOR: 1.05 &amp; 1.07) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of individual (AOR: 1.05-1.09), organizational (AOR: 1.30) and governmental preventive measures (AOR: 1.14-1.21), perceived preparedness to potential outbreak after work resumption (AOR: 1.10-1.50) and depressive symptoms (AOR: 0.87) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measures. At interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19 specific information through official media channels (AOR: 1.08) and face-to-face communication (AOR: 0.90) were associated with self-reported sanitizing hands. The number of preventive measures implemented within workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AOR: 1.30-1.63). Measures to strengthen hand hygiene and physical distancing among factory workers are needed to reduce transmission following work resumption. Future programs within workplaces should address multilevel factors.","Pan, Fang, Xin, Dong, Zhou, Hou, Li, Sun, Zheng, Yuan, Wang, He","https://doi.org/10.2196/22457","20200914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4815,""
"School Nurses on the Front Lines of Healthcare: The Approach to a Student With Anxiety and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","Mental illness is common, and its severity ranges from subclinical to severe, where the condition affects daily social and academic functioning. Because of its ubiquity, it is necessary that school nurses have an enhanced understanding of some of the mental health conditions that children and adolescents may be facing. As will be discussed, some mental health concerns present with somatic symptoms that may bring the student into the school nurse's office. If the nurse identifies mental health symptoms, he or she may be able to intervene, provide support, and direct the student for further management if necessary. This article will focus on anxiety in general before focusing on specific anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder. We will begin by defining these conditions and then move into discussing potential present-day stressors, such as fear and anxiety associated with the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and screening tools before closing with some suggestions for practice and a case wrap-up.","Chardavoyne, Olympia","https://doi.org/10.1177/1942602X20955154","20200914","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4816,""
"ECT in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic","The recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has placed a huge burden on healthcare systems worldwide. This emergent situation applies invariably to mental health services, and policy makers have issued new directives to adequately deal with this crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak poses special challenges to the administration of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) since the anaesthetic induction is an aerosol-generating process. The report provides a narrative account of modifications to the ECT practice at a tertiary care psychiatric hospital to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We emphasise two main modifications: use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the ECT and modifications in the anaesthetic procedure to mitigate potential transmission.","Ramakrishnan, Kim, Yung, Mayur","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220953705","20200914","COVID-19; aerosol-generating procedure; electroconvulsive therapy; personal protective equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4817,""
"A plea for the sustained implementation of digital interventions for young people with mental health problems in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the consequent global lockdown posed a particular challenge for youths with mental health problems. Crucial interference with their everyday lives likely increased psychological distress while accessibility of conventional mental health care was limited. Ongoing online trials offer a unique opportunity to analyse mental health status and help-seeking behaviour of adolescents during the pandemic. The ProHEAD-online trial aims at improving help-seeking behaviour of children and adolescents with significant psychological impairment. From January to May 2020, 1,042 students had access to the ProHEAD-online platform providing information on mental illness, monitoring, peer support and professional counselling. In the week from 11 March, when schools were closed in Germany, a drastic (more than 2 standard deviations) but time-limited increase in utilization of the ProHEAD-online services became apparent. This may indicate a worsened mental health status and an increased help seeking via digital services during the lockdown. Although this finding is purely observational, it speaks to the importance of evidence-based online service in the field of mental health within the current crisis and beyond.","Kaess, Moessner, Koenig, Lustig, Bonnet, Becker, Eschenbeck, Rummel-Kluge, Thomasius, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13317","20200914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4818,""

Besides, this pandemic imposed adverse consequences on public health, particularly on the mental health status of individuals with serious mental illness. However, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the patients with feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) are at this stage unclear.

"International Efforts to Save Healthcare Personnel during COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global challenge. Several governments of the world have decided to take drastic actions in order to combat the spread of the disease, including the closing of air, maritime and land borders, as an extreme measure of isolation of each country/region. However, such measures had not prevented the disease from spreading globally; as COVID-19 has already spread in almost all countries. This virus's main victims are the healthcare personnel (HCP), who are physically and psychologically affected. The HCP serves as the first line of defense against this pandemic, what if we faced a significant loss in their number? And what if our HCP was going through a deep dark depression? The condition would be terrifying not only for now but also in the future. This raises the need for an intensified International collaboration, that mainly supports the HCP. We are throwing by challenging moments, and it is clear that social distancing, cooperation, hygiene awareness and abide by the recommendation and help of all governments, as well as obtaining the support of international organizations could be an excellent tool for preventing an increase in the number of cases, principally in countries and regions were COVID-19 is in the early stage of the epidemic. However, this is not the final solution for the current pandemic. An intensified global program, which mainly supports the HCP, then considers the other aspects of the COVID19 pandemic might bring this pandemic to a peaceful end.","Mohamed, Rezaei, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-RomÃƒÂ¡n, Rahmani, Zhang, Ivanovska, A Makka, Joya, Makuku, Md Shahidul Islam, Nesrine Radwan, Laila Rahmah, Goda, Sunny O Abarikwu, Mujtaba Shaw, Zoghi, Irtsyan, Ling, Orsolya Cseprekal, Attig-Bahar, Hazar Sayar, Soloukey, Giulia Grancini","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i3.9891","20200914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4820,""
"#StayHomeStayFit: UNIMI's approach to online healthy lifestyle promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 lockdown imposed radical changes in the lifestyles of the population through isolation measures, with considerable health, social, psychological and economic consequences. Lockdown measures may have exacerbated negative population behaviors regarding exercise and nutrition, with risk of weight gain and obesity, collectively predisposing to increased cardiometabolic risk and mortality. At particular risk of deleterious consequences were patients such as those affected by chronic non communicable diseases (CNCD). The benefits of regular exercise are evident at several levels of CNCD prevention, however, from a public health standpoint, it is important to consider they are also related to improved stress management, work/academic performance, and reduced illegal behavior, isolation and depression. Therefore, during enforced isolation, a primary goal for all individuals is to maintain energy balance. During lockdown, several lifestyle interventions were posted online, with the internet playing a major role in exercise and fitness promotion. Among these one must recognize the ambitious &quot;#StayHomeStayFit&quot; project by the University of Milan, providing useful general information and trustworthy advice regarding nutrition, physical activity, and psychological support, for the general population in a time of need. Data showed a total of 21224 views on various social media and webpages during the reference period, with a mean time of 4' 17'' spent per page/video. Given the health risks associated with population physical inactivity and unhealthy lifestyle, policymakers should evaluate the benefits of projects such as #StayHomeStayFit and consider how to maximize population perception and reach. After all, additional COVID-19 lockdowns might be implemented in the future.","Lucini, Gandolfi, Antonucci, Cavagna, Valzano, Botta, Chiari, Mameli, Nahum, Brambilla, Castaldi, Biganzoli","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i3.10375","20200914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4821,""

"LGBTQ+ Farmer Health in COVID-19","The limited data on LGBTQ+ farmers demonstrate that this population lacks adequate healthcare access and faces stigma in agricultural communities. Given that COVID-19 disproportionately impacts LGBTQ+ populations, we investigate how working conditions and healthcare bias may expose LGBTQ+ farmers - essential employees - to high risk of transmitting the virus. During COVID-19, LGBTQ+ farmers may experience worse mental health outcomes as they face occupational and identity-based stressors. Conversely, LGBTQ+ farmers may also demonstrate mental health resilience during COVID-19 due to pre-existing socially distant networks they created in light of agricultural heterosexism. What is unique about COVID-19 is that healthcare inequities of a relatively small percentage of the agriculture workforce has amplifying implications for the entire agrifood system. We call for research on LGBTQ+ farmers to understand how sexuality impacts agricultural health, to uncover health risks and protective factors that may increase the health of farming communities, and to support essential food production during a pandemic.","Wypler, Hoffelmeyer","https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.1814923","20200914","COVID-19; LGTBQ+; farmworkers; mental health; sexuality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4823,""
"Post-discharge persistent symptoms and health-related quality of life after hospitalization for COVID-19","To assess post-discharge persistent symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients hospitalized in a COVID-19 ward unit more than 100 days after their admission. All eligible patients were contacted by phone by trained physicians and were asked to answer to a dedicated questionnaire. Patients managed in hospital ward without needing intensive care were compared with those who were transferred in intensive care units (ICU). We included 120 patients after a mean (Ã‚Â±SD) of 110.9 (Ã‚Â±11.1) days following admission. The most frequently reported persistent symptoms were fatigue (55%), dyspnoea (42%), loss of memory (34%), concentration and sleep disorders (28% and 30.8%, respectively). Comparisons between ward- and ICU patients led to no statistically significant differences regarding those symptoms. In both group, EQ-5D (mobility, self-care, pain, anxiety or depression, usual activity) was altered with a slight difference in pain in the ICU group. Most patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 still have persistent symptoms. While there were few differences between HRQoL between ward and ICU patients, our findings must be confirmed in larger cohorts, including more severe patients.","Garrigues, Janvier, Kherabi, Le Bot, Hamon, Gouze, Doucet, Berkani, Oliosi, Mallart, Corre, Zarrouk, Moyer, Galy, Honsel, Fantin, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.08.029","20200913","Covid-19; Health-related quality of life; Persistent symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4824,""

"Examining Risk and Protective Factors for Psychological Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the lives of people globally, and the significant mental health consequences of this pandemic are beginning to be documented. In addition to sociodemographic and COVID-19 specific factors, psychological risk and protective mechanisms likely influence individual differences in mental health symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined associations between a broad set of risk and protective factors with symptoms of depression, anxiety, alcohol problems, and eating pathology, and investigated interactions between objective stress due to COVID-19 and risk/protective variables in predicting psychopathology. Methods: Participants were 877 adults (73.7% female) recruited via internet sources from around the globe, but primarily residing in North America (87.4%). Results: Structural equation modelling revealed that certain risk and protective factors (e.g., loneliness, latent protective factor, mindfulness) were broadly related to psychopathology, whereas others showed unique relations with specific forms of psychopathology (e.g., greater repetitive thinking and anxiety; low meaning and purpose and depression). COVID-19 objective stress interacted with risk factors, but not protective factors, to predict greater anxiety symptoms, but not other forms of psychopathology. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study of non-randomly recruited participants who reported high levels of income and education. Rates of problematic alcohol use were low. Conclusions: Findings contribute to our understanding of psychological mechanisms underlying individual differences in psychopathology in the context of a global stressor. Strategies that reduce loneliness and increase mindfulness will likely impact the greatest number of mental health symptoms.","Sarah Elizabeth Racine et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46138-37C-D44","20200914","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; protective factors; covid-19; risk factors; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-15","",4826,""
