"Health professionalsâ€™ experience of treatment of patients whose community treatment order was revoked under new capacity-based mental health legislation in Norway: qualitative study","BackgroundNorway introduced capacity-based legislation in mental healthcare on 1 September 2017 with the aim of increasing patient autonomy and legal protection and reducing the use of coercion. The new legislation was expected to be particularly important for patients under community treatment orders (CTOs).AimsTo explore health professionalsâ€™ experiences of how capacity-based legislation affects healthcare services for patients whose compulsory treatment order was revoked as a result of being assessed as having capacity to consent.MethodNine health professionals responsible for treatment and care of patients whose CTO was revoked owing to the new legislation were interviewed in depth from September 2019 to March 2020. We used a hermeneutic approach to the interviews and analysis of the transcripts.ResultsThe participants found that capacity-based legislation raised their awareness of their responsibility for patient autonomy and involvement in treatment and care. They also felt a need for more frequent assessments of patientsâ€™ condition and capacity to consent and more flexibility between levels of care.ConclusionsThe study shows that health professionals found that capacity-based legislation raised their awareness of their responsibility for patient autonomy and involvement in treatment and care. They sought closer dialogue with patients, providing information and advice, and more frequently assessing patientsâ€™ condition to adjust treatment and care to enable them to retain their capacity to consent. This could be challenging and required competence, continuity and close collaboration between personnel in different healthcare services at primary and specialist level.","Wergeland, Nina Camilla, Fause, Ã…shild, Weber, Astrid Karine, Anett Beatrix Osnes, Fause, Riley, Henriette","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.592","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(6), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",39981,""
"Healing Right Way RCT: Novel interventions to enhance the cultural security of rehabilitation services for Aboriginal Australians with brain injury","Background: Access to rehabilitation services for Aboriginal people following acquired brain injury (ABI) is frequently hindered by challenges navigating: i) complex medical systems, ii) geographical distances from services and iii) culturally insecure service delivery. Healing Right Way is the first randomised control trial (RCT) to address these issues in partnership with multiple health service providers across Western Australia (WA). Aims: To outline the multicomponent Healing Right Way intervention by providing case studies, and describing challenges, facilitators and implications for rehabilitation services. Method: This stepped-wedge cluster RCT involved four metropolitan and four regional sites across WA. Aboriginal adults hospitalised for ABI were recruited from 2018-2021. Intervention components comprised ABI-related cultural security training (CST) for hospital staff, and employment of Aboriginal Brain Injury Coordinators (ABICs) to support ABI survivors for six months post-injury. The primary outcome was quality of life (measured with Euro QOL-5D-3L VAS) at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes included participants' overall function and disability, anxiety and depression, carer strain, and changes to service delivery across the 26-week follow-up period. Detailed process and cost evaluations were also undertaken. Results: 108 participants were recruited from the participating sites. The CST was delivered across all eight participating hospitals with 250 hospital staff trained. ABICs supported 61 participants, 70% residing in regional, rural or remote areas. Challenges to implementation of the intervention included impacts from COVID-19 responses, hospital staff turnover and availability, recruitment of people with traumatic brain injury and methods for maintaining contact with participants and next-of-kin across locations. Collaboration with Aboriginal health providers and community networks were invaluable to maintaining contact with participants during follow-up, as was telehealth and research partnerships. Discussion/Conclusions: This landmark trial provides a novel multicomponent intervention in an underserviced population to inform muchneeded service improvements for Aboriginal people with ABI across metropolitan and rural settings.","Armstrong, E.; Coffin, J.; Hersh, D.; Katzenellenbogen, J.

"Controlled Evaluation of a Sport-Specific Performance Optimization Program in a Biracial Black and White Athlete Diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and Agoraphobia","There are a very limited number of sport-specific mental health and sport performance interventions available for athletes of color. This study examined The Optimum Performance Program in Sports (TOPPS) in a biracial adolescent athlete who was diagnosed with Agoraphobia and Social Anxiety Disorder. A multiple-baseline across behaviors case trial design was used to evaluate outcomes. A battery of psychological measures specific to mental health and sport performance was administered at baseline, post-intervention, and a 3-month follow-up. Social skill sets (i.e., positive assertion and negative assertion) were systematically targeted sequentially in a virtual format using HIPAA compliant video-conferencing technology to safeguard against contracting COVID-19. Results demonstrated improvement in negative and positive assertion skills when targeted by the intervention. Severity of concurrent symptoms associated with Social Anxiety Disorder and Agoraphobia Symptoms, general psychiatric functioning, relationships with coaches, teammates and family, and factors interfering with sports performance improved from pre- to post-intervention. These improvements were maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Athlete ratings indicated their satisfaction with TOPPS was high, and intervention components were implemented with high integrity.

"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Adolescent Girls Infected with COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: Pandemics are known to cause an increase in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the same along with other problems such as anxiety and depression. Aim(s): To find out the prevalence of PTSD and other mental health abnormalities among adolescent girls who have contracted COVID-19 infection and the factors associated with it. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study carried out for 6 months at RL Jalappa Hospital and Research Center, Kolar. Adolescent girls infected with COVID-19 were included. A total of 100 girls took part in the study after matching inclusion and exclusion criteria. To assess for PTSD, the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview-KID (MINI-KID) and CPSS-5 Interviewer Version (CPSS 5-I) questionnaire were used. Data entered in Microsoft office excel were analyzed using SPSS v 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). To check for the association between factors, chi-square test was applied. Result(s): The majority of girls were aged 18 years, belonged to nuclear families, and had a hospital stay for 7 days to14 days. About 15% of the girls had PTSD diagnosed using two tools. Panic disorder and separation anxiety were commonly seen. Duration of COVID symptoms adolescent girls had before being diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR and duration of the hospital stay along with symptoms like throat pain, headache, and diarrhea were a few clinical factors that had a statistically significant association with PTSD. Mental health screening seems to be disregarded in COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 can be a traumatic stressor event among adolescents which can elicit PTSD-like responses and also exacerbate mental health problems. Conclusion(s): Early screening for PTSD or other mental health abnormalities among adolescents post COVID-19 infection should be considered.

"Emotion, Cognition, and COVID-19: A Study Exploring the Association Between Fear of COVID-19 Intolerance of Uncertainty and Decision-Making in Indian Adolescents","Introduction: Fear and uncertainty are the 2 ingredients of psychological challenges brought about by coronavirus (COVID-19). Fear and intolerance of uncertainty can affect decision-making. Because of the pandemic and owing to their phase of cognitive development, adolescents are more susceptible to such influence. Objective(s): To explore and understand the effects of COVID-19 on emotion and cognition by investigating the association between fear of COVID-19, intolerance for uncertainty, and decision-making in Indian adolescents. Method(s): The sample constituted 136 Indian adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. The sampling technique used was a nonprobability sampling technique called snowball sampling. The sample was collected through an online platform, ie, WhatsApp, Facebook, and most responses were received from Delhi, Sirsa (Haryana), and Chandigarh. The tools administered were the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCVS-19), the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), and the adolescent decision-making questionnaire (ADMQ). Correlational, regression, and mediational analyses were conducted to study the associations and interactions between the 3 study variables. Result(s): The sample consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. The correlational analysis reported significant positive relationships between fear of COVID-19, intolerance of uncertainty, and maladaptive decision-making. Further, mediation analysis reported: (a) the intolerance of uncertainty mediates the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and maladaptive decision-making patterns and (b) fear of COVID-19 mediates the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and maladaptive decision-making patterns. Conclusion(s): The findings indicated that emotions experienced by adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative and significant effect on their decision-making. Thus, it is necessary to mitigate these effects to ensure optimal development of their cognitive skills during calamities such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The coronavirus pandemic and the postpartum mother","Aims: To investigate postpartum maternal mental health, wellbeing, physical activity, dietary, and sleep patterns during the coronavirus (COVID-19) social distancing restrictions. Method(s): A total of 130 women residing in Australia in their first year postpartum were invited to complete an online survey during level 3 and 4 social distancing restrictions and again once restrictions had been lifted. Maternal mental health was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale. Physical activity was assessed using the Godin- Shephard Leisure Score and accelerometry. Dietary patterns were assessed using an adapted food frequency questionnaire. Sleep and values for general health were assessed using non-validated Likert scales. Data was analysed using an analysis of variance. Result(s): Data from 45 participants (33+/-4 years, 6+/-4 months postpartum;body mass index (BMI): 26+/-4 kg.m-2) are presented. Mean depression, anxiety, and stress scores were significantly lower after COVID-19 compared to during restrictions (all p &lt; 0.04). Similarly, maternal wellbeing was significantly improved after COVID-19 restrictions had lifted for social functioning, role limitations due to emotional health, and mental health (all p &lt; 0.03). Interestingly, women increased their legume intake after COVID-19 restrictions had been lifted (p =0.04). No differences were seen in the values upheld by women for their general health, sleep, relationships, weight, or physical activity (all p &gt; 0.05). Discussion(s): Data shows women in their first year postpartum during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions and though subsequent effects on sleep, diet, and physical activity remains to be determined following the analysis of food diaries and accelerometers. Data during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests whilst women were impacted by the social distancing restrictions, they do not compare to similar studies published internationally of women in the same demographic. This data will serve to provide further information for the necessary support women during the postpartum require in times of social isolation and pandemic environments.","Christie, H.

"Psychological Time during the COVID-19 Lockdown: Canadian Data","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated measures have affected routines and mental well-being of people around the world. Research also shows distorted time perception during lockdowns which can partially be explained by compromised well-being. The present study investigates Canadiansâ€™ temporal experience and mental well-being at two periods of national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic (spring 2020: n = 66;beginning of 2021: n = 100). As results indicate, the only difference between these periods on the investigated variables was the strictness of lockdown measures. Our findings show associations between anxiety, depression, confinement indicators, and time perception (future temporal distance, passage of time judgments). Stepwise regression models indicated that depression and strictness of measures predicted the impression that the next week appeared farther away;oneâ€™s loneliness appraisal was associated with a perceived slower time flow. Our findings give a preliminary idea about time perception and mental well-being in the Canadian lockdowns.

"Clinical leaders, the first step for emotionally intelligent leadership","Burnout is known to decrease quality of care and is associated with mental health problems or drug abuse.1 If we add the overwhelming and sustained workload and emotional impact during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, moral distress and burnout have increased since then.2 To the date, especially at the end of 20th century, different leadership models have been developed with a core objective: being part of an organisationâ€™s transformation. [...]we believe it is timely to analyse the key elements of this new model of leadership, and this is the main goal of this article. The growing concern for healthcare professionalsâ€™ satisfaction has changed the usual models of health management in organisations, and it is beginning to be included at the same level as the interest in healthcare costs or quality.11 In the USA, there are hospitals such as the Mayo Clinic that have started projects to reduce the burnout in their professionals and are a distinguishing feature of new leadership models.12 These new leaderships must put professional satisfaction as part of the strategy to achieve higher quality of care at a lower cost as part of a shift from triple aim to quadruple Aim. Since burnout is a problem that affects healthcare professionals and organisations, and despite the figures in the USA being higher,13 our country14 and Europe15 in general are not far behind. [...]honesty and credibility are two elements that are key to ethical leadership.18Table 1 Key characteristics of emotional-based leadership.","Yuguero, Oriol, Inzitari, Marco, Tolchinsky, Gustavo","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000423","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 6(3):219-221, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",39990,""
"Outcomes of Patient Experience Survey on Video Consultation Via Circuit at the Huntington's Disease Multi-Disciplinary Clinic in the Uk","The UCL Huntington's Disease Centre Multidisciplinary clinic sees over 1,000 patients who from across the country. During the SARS-Covid19 pandemic, the clinic shifted to 100% remote consultation, using the video platform Circuit by Unify (https://eu.yourcircuit.com). The introduction of video platform enabled the clinic to operate throughout the pandemic. After the relaxation of local guidelines, most appointments have returned to in-person appointments, however, some patients, especially distant and care-home residents, continue to request video appointments. Given it is likely that video appointments will be a permanent addition to the service, we set out to evaluate the user experience from our patients to assess whether the video appointments are meeting their needs. To this end, we designed our electronic form specific to our centre, and sent to 100 patients and their carers who used the platform in the preceding 6 months. The survey addresses aspects of patient satisfaction such as convenience of location, technical issues of using the video platform, and waiting times, as well as overall clinical experience. The results will be analysed in two groups. Group 1 will be those without acute psychiatric illnesses, and Group 2 will be those with acute psychiatric illnesses. I will present the results our audit with these groups to evaluate the patient experience of virtual clinic appointments.","Nakajima, M.; Hearst, C.; Rae, D.; Tabrizi, S.

"Effects of an e-health intervention â€˜iSupportâ€™ for reducing distress of dementia carers: protocol for a randomised controlled trial and feasibility study","IntroductionIn the UK, National Health Service (NHS) guidelines recommend that informal carers of people living with dementia should be offered training to help them develop care skills and manage their own physical and mental health. The WHO recommends access to affordable, proven, well-designed, online technologies for education, skills training and support for dementia carers. In response to these recommendations, this multisite randomised controlled trial (RCT) is the first study in the UK to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an online support programme developed by the WHO called â€˜iSupport for dementia carersâ€™.Methods and analysis350 informal carers (age 18+ years) living in Britain who self-identify as experiencing stress and depression will be recruited. They will be randomised to receive â€˜iSupportâ€™, or standardised information about caring for someone with dementia (controlâ€“comparison). Data will be collected via videoconferencing (eg, Zoom) or telephone interview at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Intention-to-treat analysis will ascertain effectiveness in the primary outcomes (distress and depression) and combined cost, and quality-adjusted life-year data will be used to assess cost-effectiveness compared with usual care from a public sector and wider societal perspective. A mixed-methods process evaluation with a subgroup of carers in the intervention (~N=50) will explore the barriers and facilitators to implementing â€˜iSupportâ€™.

"Mental health literacy of school-going adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa: a regional systematic review protocol","IntroductionAssessing mental health literacy has implications for the identification and treatment of mental health problems. Adolescents have been identified as a particularly important target group for initiating and improving mental health literacy. However, much of what we know about adolescent mental health literacy comes from high-income countries. This proposed review seeks to synthesise the available published primary evidence from sub-Saharan Africa on the status and measurement of mental health literacy among school-going adolescents.Methods and analysisWe will perform a systematic review reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA-2020). We will systematically search selected global databases (EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed and MEDLINE) and regional electronic databases (African Index Medicus and African Journals OnLine) up to December 2021 for observational and qualitative studies published in English and French. The standard quality assessment criteria for evaluating primary research papers from a variety of fields (QualSyst criteria) will be used to appraise the methodological quality of the included studies. The Petticrew-Roberts 3-step approach to narrative synthesis will be applied to the included studies.Ethics and disseminationWe will not seek ethical approval from an institutional review board, as this is a systematic review of available and accessible literature. When completed, the full report of this review will be submitted to a journal for peer-reviewed publication;the key findings will be presented at local and international conferences withâ€”partial or fullâ€”focus on (adolescent) mental health (literacy).PROSPERO registration numberCRD42021229011.","Sodi, Tholene, Quarshie, Emmanuel Nii-Boye, Kwaku Oppong, Asante, Radzilani-Makatu, Makondelele, Makgahlela, Mpsanyana, Nkoana, Shai, Mutambara, Julia","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063687","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",39994,""
"Police officersâ€™ workâ€“life balance, job satisfaction and quality of life: longitudinal effects after changing the shift schedule","ObjectivesTo evaluate mental health-related outcomes of police officers 5.5 years after implementing a new alternating shift schedule which was supposed to improve their health and workâ€“life balance.DesignPreâ€“post study design with a baseline survey at the beginning of the piloting of the new shift schedule in 2015 and another survey 5.5 years later in 2020.SettingPolice departments of a German metropolitan police force piloting the new shift schedule.Participants116 shift-working police officers out of a population of 1673 police officers at the follow-up date.InterventionsNew shift schedule based on occupational health recommendations.Outcomes measuresWorkâ€“life balance, job satisfaction and quality of life.MethodsMixed analyses of variances were used to test the hypotheses of within-subject and between-subject differences regarding time and gender.ResultsWe found partly significant differences between the baseline and follow-up survey for workâ€“life balance (F(1, 114) = 6.168, p=0.014, <U+03B7>pÂ² = 0.051), job satisfaction (F(1, 114) = 9.921, p=0.002, <U+03B7>pÂ² = 0.080) and quality of life (F(1, 114) = 0.593, p=0.443, <U+03B7>pÂ² = 0.005). Neither significant differences between male and female police officers nor interaction effects of time and gender were found.ConclusionAn increase was found for each of the three outcomes 5.5 years after implementing the new shift schedule. The results contribute to the current state of research on mental health-related outcomes of working conditions in shift work. On this basis, recommendations for designing shift schedules can be deduced to promote mental health and job satisfaction for employees in shift work.","Rohwer, Elisabeth, Marcial Velasco, Garrido, Herold, Robert, Preisser, Alexandra Marita, TerschÃ¼ren, Claudia, Harth, Volker, Mache, Stefanie","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063302","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",39995,""
"Impact of prolonged isolation on adolescents with drug-susceptible tuberculosis in Lima, Peru: a qualitative study","ObjectivesPatients with tuberculosis (TB) generally are instructed to isolate at the beginning of treatment in order to prevent disease transmission. The duration of isolation varies and may be prolonged (ie, lasting 1 month or more). Few studies have examined the impact of isolation during TB treatment on adolescents, who may be more vulnerable to its negative effects.MethodsThis study took place from 2018 through 2019 in Lima, Peru, where the Ministry of Health mandates the exclusion of patients with TB from educational institutions for at least 2 months. Using semi-structured guides, we conducted individual in-depth interviews with adolescents who received treatment for drug-susceptible TB, their primary caregivers and health providers. We performed thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews.ResultsWe interviewed 85 participants: 34 adolescents, 36 caregivers and 15 healthcare workers. At the time of their TB diagnoses, 28 adolescents were in secondary, postsecondary, vocational or military school. Adolescents with drug-susceptible TB were prescribed home isolation usually for 2 (and occasionally for 1) months. Consequently, they could neither attend school nor socialise with family members or friends. Two primary themes emerged from the interviews. First, as a result of their exclusion from school, most adolescents fell behind academically and had to repeat a semester or academic year. Second, absence from school, separation from friends and loved ones, and reinforcement of TB-related stigma (arising from fear of TB transmission) harmed adolescentsâ€™ mental health.ConclusionProlonged isolation led to educational setbacks and emotional trauma among adolescents with TB. Prolonged isolation is not supported by current evidence on TB transmission and is problematic from a human rights perspective, as it violates adolescentsâ€™ rights to education and freedom of movement. Isolation recommendations should be re-evaluated to align with data on TB transmission and the principles of patient-centred care.","Oliva Rapoport, Victoria Elena, Altamirano, Elmer, Senador, Liz, Wong, Milagros, Beckhorn, Catherine B.; Coit, Julia, Roche, Stephanie D.; Lecca, Leonid, Galea, Jerome T.; Chiang, Silvia S.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063287","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",39996,""
"Impact of spiritual healing on moderate depression in adults: a study protocol of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT)","IntroductionDepression is a common mental disorder and the (global) leading cause of all non-fatal burden of disease worldwide. Currently, supported treatment for depression is antidepressant medication and different psychotherapeutic interventions. Many patients experience, however, adverse effects of antidepressant medication, while at the same time the access to psychotherapeutic interventions are limited. Many patients who suffer from depression turn to complementary medicine and among those modalities often spiritual healing. There is some evidence that consulting a spiritual healer can be beneficial for patients who suffer from depression, and that spiritual healing is associated with low risk. The aim of this protocol is to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) (spiritual healing as addition to usual care vs usual care alone) in preparation of a larger trial in adults with moderate depression, to examine feasibility and individualsâ€™ experience of spiritual healing.Methods and analysisThis study is a pilot RCT with two parallel groups. A total of 28 adult patients with moderate depression, diagnosed by the physician and according to the Montgomery and Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale criteria will be randomised to spiritual healing in addition to usual care (n=14) or usual care alone (n=14). To determine if there is a statistical indication of an effect of healing warranting a full-scale study;the separation test will be used. To investigate participantsâ€™ experience with spiritual healing, a qualitative study will be included using semistructured interviews. The data will be analysed based on a direct content analysis.Ethics and disseminationThis protocol was approved by regional committees for medical and health research ethics by the identifier (63692).

"Reducing the health impacts of ambient air pollution","Ambient air pollution is the fifth highest risk factor for death (after hypertension, smoking, high fasting glucose, and high total cholesterol), according to the Health Effects Institute.1 Annually, 8.7 million global deaths are thought to be caused by inhalation of particulate matter released into the air from combustion of fossil fuels.2 In Europe, particulate matter and ozone account for almost 800 000 excess deaths annually.3 Additionally, an exposure-response study has estimated that particulate air pollution has contributed to approximately 15% (95% confidence interval, 7% to 33%) of covid-19 deaths worldwide.4 Evidence on how ambient air pollution affects health is abundant;however, much less is available on protecting health from this impact.

"Covid-19 Pandemic Impact on Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children (Uasc) Tuberculosis Screening Service","Aims Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) are a vulnerable group who experience lot of physical and mental health difficulties during their journey. In the UK, it is statutory for all UASC to have Initial Health Assessment (IHA). NICE recommends screening for specific high-risk groups in the UK. These groups include: close contacts of patients with TB (Tuberculosis), healthcare workers, immunosuppressed patients (for example those with HIV) and migrants from countries where TB is common. Some of UASC come from countries with high incidence of TB infection. It is important to ensure that children at high risk of TB are identified and screened to avoid potential public health consequences. The effect of the pandemic on USAC is not fully understood. It is important to ensure that children at high risk of TB are identified and screened to avoid potential public health consequences. The effect of the pandemic on USAC is not fully understood. An audit was completed in a big paediatric setting at a children's hospital in the United Kingdom exploring the local TB screening uptake pre-pandemic (prior to 2020) and midpandemic (2020-2021). The audit compared practice of the local USAC clinic with the national guidelines on migrant health guidance. The pattern of USAC pre-pandemic and midpandemic were compared. Methods Details of the USAC children were retrieved from the 'Looked after Children' database in the hospital. Following the initial health assessment, the USAC who were deemed to be at increased risk of TB were referred to the asylum-seeking service for the screening and subsequent referrals to the chest clinic. The risk factors were guided by the country of origin, their symptoms and the BCG immunisation status. Results 33 USAC were seen for initial health assessment over 2 years period. The demographic characteristics and country of origin were similar prior to and after March 2020. 18 UASC were seen in 12-month period prior to March 2020. 77.7% of these qualified for TB screening. 15 USAC were seen in the 12-month period after March 2020. 73.3% of these qualified for TB screening. Of the 33 USAC, 25 met the criteria for TB screening and were therefore referred to the asylum-seeking team for the screen. 15/25 (60%) received the screening. None of these 15 children were diagnosed with active TB but 3 (16.6%) were diagnosed and treated for latent TB. Each of 10 young people who missed the screening were identified and advised to be followed through. The missed screening was mainly due to non-clinic attendance or young person's move out of the area. Conclusion In this audit, the number of UASC and the proportion of them that required TB screening did not change during the pandemic. TB screening identified a significant number of cases of latent TB but no active TB. A few of young people missed their TB screening which has potentially serious consequences if they were infected. Joint working groups with the local authority established and UASC pathway streamlined to avoid similar situations in future.","Kiddo, N.; Sadavarte, V.; Gilchrist, F.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.823","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Supplement 2):A511-A512, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40001,""
"Mental Health Attendances to the Emergency Department by Children and Young People -a Comparison between Pre-Pandemic and Pandemic Years","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of children and young people (CYP);with illness-related anxiety, social/physical distancing, mandatory quarantines, travel restrictions, school closures, isolation and family disruptions having a negative impact on mental wellbeing. While several reports have highlighted high rates of mental health problems and suicidal ideation, few studies have focused on self-harm related hospital attendances by CYP during the pandemic or provided reliable trend analyses in comparison with pre-pandemic data. Our objective was to compare pre-pandemic (2019) and pandemic (2020 and 2021) attendances to the emergency department by CYP, for mental health issues including overdose, self-harm, suicidal ideation/attempt. Methods * Single-centre observation study of CYP of age 8 years to 18 years, attending the emergency department (ED) for overdose, self-harm and suicidal ideation/attempt, from 01/ 01/2019 to 31/12/2021 (36 months). * Eligible patients were identified using discharge diagnostic coding and mental health services database review using search terms including 'overdose', 'deliberate self-harm', 'self-harm', 'self-injury', 'self-injured', 'hurt themselves', 'suicide', 'suicidal', 'suicidal ideation. Results * 1226 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. * Number of CYP attending ED in 2019, 2020 and 2021 were 374, 418 and 434 respectively. * Compared to 2019, in 2021 there is a 16% overall increase in the number of CYP attending ED for mental health issues (figure 1). Of note, 2021's analysis shows that the rate of ED attendance was greater in the first 6 months when compared to the latter 6 months. * The greatest increase from 2019 is seen in CYP attending with suicidal intent and overdose (figure 2). * We will be carrying out further data analysis on our inner-city population evaluating the disparities across age, gender and socio-economic status as well as the care journey of reattenders. In addition, data collection will continue in 2022 to evaluate if this trend continues or stabilises post-removal of pandemic restrictions Conclusion * Continuing incremental trend of ED attendances in 2021 despite the easing of pandemic restrictions in July 2021 and vaccine roll-out for 12-16-year-olds in September 2021 suggest a cumulative impact on mental health from the long course of the pandemic. As noted in figure 2, over 60% of the patients seen in 2021 were in the first half of the year, suggesting that continuing lockdowns may have had an impact in attendance. Further, UK youth surveys report that many CYP found the 2021 lockdown harder than the 2020 lockdowns, possibly due to the prolongation of uncertainty over the future.1 * The short and long-term mental health implications of the pandemic should be seen against the background of worsening mental health morbidity in CYP in the UK over the preceding few years, especially as our data shows a large increase in presentations with suicidal ideation/attempt. This calls for a systematic response to widen access to mental health services in the future.

"Impact of Covid-19 on the Frequency of Children and Young People Presenting to a Secondary Care Setting Due to Mental Health Disorders","Aims COVID-19 has impacted the lives of children and young people (CYP) through the effects of national lockdowns on education, social services and children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).1 Due to COVID-19, the number of CYP seeking help from such services has decreased. Since 2017, there has been a 6% increase in the number of CYP identified as having a probable mental disorder and those with mental health (MH) problems are more likely to state that lockdown made their life worse than those without.2 Aim Assess the trend of CYP mental health presentations and admissions to an acute paediatric service and the potential impact of COVID-19, as part of a service evaluation. Methods Presentations to PED from April-October 2019 (pre- COVID) and April-October 2021 (during COVID) were analysed. Those who were admitted to the acute MH ward were identified. Data including demographics, presenting complaint, length of stay, past MH history/admissions, previous involvement with CAMHS and discharge destination were collected. Data from 2019 was compared to 2021 using Fisher's exact test and unpaired t-tests to establish significance. Results There was a 132% increase in the number of children presenting to PED from 2019 to 2021 with a MH related problem (table 1);the absolute number of admissions increased by 97%. Demographics were similar in 2019 and 2021. There was a significant increase in the mean length of admission from 4 days to 8.7 days in 2021 (p=0.037). There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients who were discharged home with a community CAMHS follow up (p=0.003). Fewer patients were admitted to psychiatric units in 2021 compared to 2019 (5% vs 21%). Overdose was the commonest cause of admission with a significant increase from 2019 to 2021 (p=0.037). Conclusion There was an increase in the number of CYP presenting to PED with MH crisis from 2019 to 2021. The number of children admitted to our acute paediatric ward in 2021 nearly doubled from 2019, suggesting a possible deterioration of CYP MH during the pandemic. This seems consistent with national data from 2020 following the first wave of COVID-19.2 Throughout 2019 and 2021, the majority of admitted patients were previously known to CAMHS, yet were still presenting to PED. This may reflect accessibility issues due to reduced capacity of community CAMHS as an indirect effect of the pandemic. Our findings highlight the concerning increase in admissions of CYP due to overdose since the start of COVID-19, reflecting the vulnerability and lack of support services for children in inner cities. Lastly, we have demonstrated an increase in the burden on acute paediatric wards, imposing logistical pressures on bed management, personnel, patient environment and cost. These effects warrant immediate, careful consideration in the context of public health as well as CAMHS provision in primary and secondary care.

Since then, a multitude of further research has been conducted in the field. Scientific curiosity led me to research the link between early trauma and physical, mental, and social health. Having conducted and presented the results of a pilot study (pre-pandemic), my passion grew, leading to an in-depth literature review on the relating factors, mechanism and relationship between ACE's and physical and mental health, followed by an extensive undergraduate study, to ascertain the impact of ACE's on medical students, in particular focusing on emotional health, during this pandemic (2021). Methods A sample of 140 students attending the university of medicine and pharmacy 'Grigore T. Popa' were surveyed, collecting demographic, physical, mental, social, and emotional health data by means of an Google Forms questionnaire (including: the Pittsburgh sleep quality Index,2 and WHO ACE-IQ3). Correlations were made between different variables, such as: gender, nationality, self-rated physical health and 'binary ACE score'. Results 61.4% were female, with participants from across the globe. The average age was 23.13 years. A snapshot of the prevalence of ACE's was obtained, 29.3% had an ACE score of 4 or more. Of the categories of ACE's: a quarter having experienced sexual abuse, witnessing physical violence (without objects) in just under a third (31%), and threats or actual abandonment or exclusion from the house in just under 1 in 5 (19%). While data confirmed the findings of previous studies on the impact of ACE's on physical health, the most notable findings were in relation to emotional health. In the past year, 39.3% reported having felt deep sadness more than three times. 47.1% reported feelings of worthlessness more than three times in the past year. 27.1% reported excessive worry, 15% reported thoughts of self-harm. Positive correlations were observed between ACE score, and feelings of deep sadness, feelings of worthlessness, excessive worry, thoughts of self-harm, and suicidal thoughts (see figure 1). Conclusion These findings underline an important issue, equally affecting the future medical professionals. Findings reflect the generation and the world as a whole, with the compounded impact of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic on mental and emotional health. Results suggest, dealing with the effects of 'post-pandemic' stress and ACE will be an issue requiring particular attention.

"Child and Young Person Admissions to a District General Hospital under Joint Camhs (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) and Paediatrics from January 2019 - April 2021","Aims Background Child and young person (CYP) mental health is a public health priority with 75% of life long mental health problems starting before the age of 25.1 Prevalence of all mental health disorders among children aged 5-15 years is 11.2%.2 Aims * To highlight current in-patient numbers and pathway, from initial presentation to discharge. * Identify any changes that can be made to improve care foryoung people admitted with mental health presentations Methods Patients were identified from daily handover sheets from January 2019 to April 2021. Information on each patient was gathered using electronic patient record. Information gathered included: 1. Number of CAMHS inpatients broken down by age, gender and diagnosis. 2. Patient pathway including time spent waiting in A&E 3. Use of Registered mental health nurse (RMN) 4. Treatments provided on ward 5. Daily review by peadiatric and CAMHS team 6. Length of stay 7. Place of discharge Results 231 CYP admitted under CAMHS between January 2019 and April 2021. See figure 1. Of these admissions 86% were female. 27 patients accounted for a fifth of admissions. Average age at admission 14 years (8-16 years). IntentionalOverdose was the most common reason for admission. See figure 2. Due to changes in computer systems, complete information regarding patient stay was available for patients between April 2020 to April 2021. 72% of patients beached four hour ED wait of which 80% due to waiting for RMN to become available. 86% of patients required an RMN. 13% of patients were under section at some point during admission. Fifth of patients were discharged to tier 4 services. Average time from admission to discharge was 10 days. The longest admission was 264 days. 97% of patients had daily paediatric reviews and 80% of patients had a daily CAMHS reviews. 62% of patientsengaged in alternative therapy during their stay. Eg art therapy or youth support worker. Conclusion Admission rates dropped during the first COVID 19 lockdown and rates tend to be lower during summer months. There tends to be increased mental health admission following return to school in September. Eating disorder patients tend to have more prolonged inpatients stay due to waiting for Tier 4 bed availability. Lack of RMNs lead to prolonged wait time in ED prior to admission. A mental health awareness teaching week was delivered to the department to encourage the team to carry out HEADSSS assessment for all young people admitted and tailor services around the YP to help improve care of patients with mental health issues.

"Difficult Conversations Workshop for Trainees in Paediatrics","Aims Effective communication skills are vital for Paediatricians to allow them to establish and develop relationships with children and their families. Whilst there is a significant emphasis on communication skills in the RCPCH curriculum, many trainees receive little dedicated communication skills teaching or feedback during Paediatric training. In addition, COVID undoubtedly had an impact on trainees' experiences and their exposure to difficult conversations. We planned a communication skills workshop involving simulated difficult conversations with actors, aimed at doctors working in General Paediatrics. The workshop aimed to offer the opportunity to practise challenging conversations and manage conflict in a supportive environment. Methods We successfully applied for COVID recovery funding to run a full day workshop for communication skills in Paediatrics. Paediatric and GP trainees working in general paediatrics were surveyed using an anonymous online platform about areas of communication they feared most. We used the areas identified to develop communication scenarios that addressed key capabilities in the RCPCH Progress curriculum. These included raising safeguarding concerns with a family, talking to a family when their child has died, exploring mental health concerns with a young person and dealing with conflict. These are common scenarios that trainees may have missed out on due to redeployment or change in work patterns. The workshop, held in October 2021, involved face-to-face simulated communication scenarios with actors for Paediatric and GP trainees currently working in general paediatrics. Each trainee led a simulated communication scenario with an actor and received a full debrief and feedback with experienced faculty. Scenarios were recorded to create a learning tool to use within the trust as examples of good practice. Trainees completed anonymous feedback online immediately after the session. Results Eight doctors attended, consisting of 2 GP trainees, 4 junior Paediatric trainees (ST2-3), 1 Paediatric ST4 trainee and 1 senior clinical fellow. All attendees rated the session as 5/5 overall on a Likert scale. The average rating for relevance to their work was 4.86/5. All felt the session had improved their communication skills (71% of trainees by 'a lot' and 29% of trainees by 'a little'). 100% would recommend the session to colleagues. Specific comments included * 'The environment felt like a safe space to debrief and discuss situations openly in a non-judgemental manner. Having professional actors involved was invaluable to get the most realistic feel to the scenarios.' * 'The faculty were really supportive, the scenarios were very realistic, the atmosphere was non-judgmental and the actors were amazing.' Conclusion Our workshop allowed trainees to experience difficult conversations relevant to their training. By basing the scenarios on trainees' suggestions, we ensured we targeted their identified learning needs. Using professional actors with experienced faculty allowed trainees to develop vital skills in a safe and realistic environment. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and we are planning to run another similar workshop in early 2022. We hope to develop a bank of scenarios that can be used to develop and hone the skills that Paediatricians of the future need to communicate effectively with children, young people and their families.","Earl, N.; Jacob, H.; Malbon, K.; Scott-Lang, C.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.604","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Supplement 2):A372-A373, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40006,""
"Setting up a Post Covid-19 Syndrome Service for Children and Young People across London - a Collaboration across Three Trusts","Aims Describe an interdisciplinary hub and spoke healthcare model for children and young people (CYP) with Post COVID-19 Syndrome Methods From November 2020, with NHS London and NHS England support, clinicians and AHP chief with backgrounds in infectious disease, adolescent medicine and psychiatry from across trusts in London collaborated to set up a hub and spoke model for delivering care to CYP with post COVID-19 syndrome. This was an iterative process with involvement of patient cohort. CYP are referred into a central weekly virtual multi-disciplinary 'hub' meeting for discussion with specialists across infectious disease;respiratory;rheumatology;neurology;chronic conditions (including ME/CFS );mental health;and allied health practitioners (AHP) with experience of rehabilitation including occupational therapists, and physiotherapists, dieticians, safeguarding practitioners. The groups has a diversity lead.The group has regular evidence-based CPD. Referrers (local paediatricians or GPs for 17-18 year olds) present patient to the MDT for discussion of diagnosis, investigation and management. Website-housed referral pathways including recommended baseline assessments are provided for referrers. A developing group of local integrated care service paediatric and AHP champions support local management, pathways and education around post COVID-19 syndrome. Patients follow one of two pathways: 1. Local management, using already available services which the MDT support 2. Face-to-face interdisciplinary consultation and rehabilitation for severe or complex cases. Local support MDT discussion, and advice to local team with letters to patients outlining impression and advice;school adjustments letters;leaflets for health professionals and CYP/ family across a range of known Post COVID symptoms and difficulties. AHP delivered virtual groups and webinars include pacing;emotional wellbeing;symptom management;eating, and sleep. As the first established post- COVID-19 service for CYP in England, we have led and supported the development of 14 other MDTs nationally. Results Between 1st April 2021 and 1st February 2022 89 patients were referred to the virtual MDT. All have received information leaflets to aid recovery. 25 CYP/families have attended the virtual groups so far. 57 CYP have received an interdisciplinary consultation and received bespoke MDT input. (see table 1) Conclusion In response to the clinical need of CYP with post COVID symptoms, the collaborative development of a Pan London service across 2 clinical sites, and 3 NHS trusts is an example of how specialist clinical care can be delivered virtually using a hub and spoke model for a proportion of patients with a complex disorder. The service development element is applicable to other future emerging diseases as well as a possible model for conditions that require multiple specialist inputs and can have confused pathways or delays in diagnosis (such as functional disorders or multi-organ pathology).","Wortley, E.; Segal, T.; Baig, B.; Gordon, A.; Brookes, Z.; Whittaker, E.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.569","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Supplement 2):A353-A354, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40007,""
"Retrospective Analysis on Implementation of Kangaroo Mother Care in Hospital Miri Nicu","Aims Hospital Miri is a district hospital with NICU that caters neonatal care service in Northern Sarawak. Preterm birth rate in our centre makes up of 10% (n=487) in 2019 and 11% (n=491) in 2020 of the live births, with mortality rate of 3% for preterm infants less than 33 weeks. According to WHO and Cochrane review (2016), Kangaroo mother care helps to reduce mortality, nosocomial infection, hypothermia, and improved growth and exclusive breastfeeding. Methods This is a retrospective observational study. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) Project was introduced in 2020 in Hospital Miri NICU as part of quality improvement project. Stable preterm infants with postmenstrual age 30 weeks to 34 weeks 6 days were enrolled with mother's consent into the project. It was carried out in 3 phases, with phase 1 of stable infants under room air or HFNC, phase 2 of stable infants on NIV and phase 3 with intubated infants. As COVID-19 endemic encroached, the project was put on hold at phase 2. Infants' demographic data was analysed using frequency and percentage. Outcomes were measured in mean, frequency and percentage. Maternal mental health score, knowledge score were taken prior to implementation of KMC and upon discharge. The mental health score is described as median and knowledge score is compared by wincoxon signed-rank test. Overall experience score was taken as median and mean. Results A total of 41 infants with the gestation of 32 to 34 weeks 6 days participated, 22 (53.7%) with majority of 41.5% aged 34 to 34 weeks 6 days post menstrual age at the time of enrolment. Mean length of stay was 38.34 days (SD:24.4), time taken to achieve birth weight was 11.4 days (SD: 4.05). Time taken to initiate breastfeeding range from 8 to 14 days to &gt;22 days of life, mean: 24.78. Eighteen infants (43.9%) achieved exclusive breastfeeding on discharge. Mother's mental health, knowledge and experience were measures using Likert scale with the total score of 15 for mental health and 18 for knowledge and experience. For mental health score, pre-KMC median score:14, post-KMC median score was 15. There was improvement in the mother's experience upon discharge (p-value: &lt;0.001). For overall experience, median was 18 with the mean score of 16.88 (SD:1.56). Conclusion Our study was suspended prematurely as per local pandemic control guideline. Knowing about the benefit of KMC to both mother and infants, we suggest that it should be encouraged and continued with adaptation and modification of the procedure during COVID-19 pandemic.","Ni, L.

"How Much Do Paediatricians Know About Poverty within the Paediatric Population?","Aims Poverty is an ever increasing problem with 4.2 million children living in poverty in the UK in 2019, an increase of 600,000 from 2011(1). This has been particularly exacerbated by the COVID pandemic with an estimated 200,000 more children living in poverty in the UK since the pandemic(1). Poverty can affect multiple aspects of children's health and wellbeing, putting additional strain on already stretched NHS recourses. We wanted to assess paediatricians' knowledge about poverty, particularly around prevalence, risk factors, the effect on children's health and wellbeing and how to help families if there are concerns of poverty. From this we hoped to highlight areas where more education and support is required. Methods We designed an online survey with 11 questions including a mixture of multiple choice and free text answers. The questionnaire was distributed to all doctors working in paediatrics at a tertiary paediatric hospital, over a 4 week period. Results There were 29 respondents in total, with grades ranging from FY1 to consultant. Nearly two-thirds of respondents underestimated the prevalence of poverty in the UK and 38% underestimated the prevalence by half or more. Over 80% of respondents underestimated the percentage of children living in poverty locally. All respondents recognised parental disability and unemployment as risk factors for poverty and 90% recognised child disability or serious illness as a risk factor. Only one person suggested parental drug and alcohol use as a risk factor. The respondents were able to list a wide range of health implications of poverty, the most common answers being failure to thrive/poor nutrition, obesity, tooth decay and poor mental health. Two-thirds of respondents admitted not feeling at all comfortable about asking parents about poverty and 40% felt that they never screen for poverty when assessing patients. To assess for poverty 34% would ask about employment, 24% about housing and 41% about benefits and additional supports. All respondents would like further education and support around poverty. Conclusion Overall there was good understanding of the health implications associated with poverty and the risk factors for poverty, but an under-appreciation of the scale of the problem. The majority of doctors do not feel comfortable asking patients and families about poverty, and do not regularly ask about poverty when assessing patients. In order to identify children living in poverty and be able to signpost families to resources that could be beneficial to them, we need to equip paediatricians with the knowledge and skills to assess for poverty and what resources are available for families in the local area. To aid this we have produced a poster to be used to in the local Emergency Department and outpatients to remind doctors about poverty, advice on how to approach the topic and resources available in the hospital and in the local area that be used to sign post families.","Rowley, L.; Marshall, A.; Craze, J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.111","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Supplement 2):A67-A68, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40009,""
"Unfair and Unequal: Comparing the Experiences and Outcomes of Children with Acute Mental Health and Acute Physical Health Presentations to the Paediatric Emergency Department","Aims A recent RCPCH publication shared the struggles across Paediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) with meeting the 'Facing the Future' standards for children and young people (CYP) with mental health (MH) concerns, with few units studied being able to adequately meet the needs of CYP in MH crisis (1). We work in a central London teaching hospital and major trauma centre: our aim was to understand the experience of CYP aged 13-17 presenting to the PED with MH concerns, as compared with those presenting with physical complaints. Methods Collection of quantitative data surrounding CYP in the ED with MH presentations (n=271), including time to be seen, time to see Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), time to admission or discharge, and total time spent in ED (all as compared with physical health presentations n=7551). Use of independent samples t-tests to analyse differences between groups across outcomes. Two time periods (1 July-30 Oct 2019 and 1 July-30 Oct 2021, n= 3913 and 3909 respectively) were examined to encapsulate pre and post COVID. Qualitative inquiry with 22 CYP presenting to the ED to co-produce experience maps to visualise their healthcare journeys and identify opportunities to improve their care. Results CYP with MH presentations spent a mean time of 747.6 minutes in the ED, compared with physical health patients who spent 195.76 minutes (p=&lt;0.001). Mean time to be seen by CAMHS was 225.0 minutes, whereas patients with physical health complaints who are referred to specialties waited 196.52 minutes to be seen (a difference that was not significant). More CYP with MH presentations than those with physical health presentations spent &gt;4 hours but &lt;12 hours in the ED (76.4% vs 18.4%, p&lt;0.001) and almost 1/3 spent more than 12 hours in the ED (32.8% vs 1.0%, p&lt;0.001). Experience mapping captured that CYP and families acknowledged the wait but would benefit from signposting of the physical environment (e.g. 'you are here' maps), the presence of age-appropriate entertainment, and the input of volunteers or staff to support basic needs (e.g. food, water, pillows): we are implementing each. Conclusion CYP with MH presentations have a worse experience of the ED than their counterparts with physical health complaints, spending longer in the department, being more likely to surpass 4 or 12 hours in the ED. CYP have indicated to us some simple changes to their environment and the management of their stay which could improve their experience. It is widely acknowledged that most areas need to grow our provision of CAMHS to meet the need, but we also need to further utilise other MH services available beyond hospital walls (e.g. crisis lines, wellbeing practitioners, school counselling, youth support services).

"Co-production to understand online help-seeking for young people experiencing emotional abuse and neglect: Building capabilities, adapting research methodology and evaluating involvement and impact","Background Objectives Methods Results Conclusions Public Contribution Involving young people (YP) as co-researchers (YCoR) in mental health research is important for ethical and epistemological reasons. However, approaches to involve and evaluate â€˜meaningful involvementâ€™ in complex qualitative mental health research, and how to evaluate impacts (or change) for the co-researcher and the research is less well defined.This co-produced research explored the experiences of YP seeking help for emotional abuse and neglect via an online, peer-peer message board. This practical case study aims to evidence the meaningful role and impacts associated with YCoR involvement in sensitive and complex mental health research using a flexible approach to co-production.During the Covid-19 pandemic, we explored on- and off-line approaches and adapted research methodology to build relationships, knowledge, skills, and confidence withÂ YCoR. The virtual involvement was evaluated against the five principles of co-production. Anonymous, continuous digital feedback, reflective practices and multiple dissemination outputs are used to evaluate the impact of the study on those involved and the research.Ten members of NeurOX Young People's Advisory GroupÂ were involved in the core project. Additional members were invited at later stages and in the dissemination of outputs. We describe a supportive, scaffolded learning approach to build capabilities and embed the lived experience of YCoR in complex qualitative research. A digital blended approach was acceptable to YCoR, principles of co-production were met and the impact/benefits of involvement are described. To demonstrate the epistemological value of involving YP we evidence YPs capabilities for involvement and the â€˜changeâ€™ or contribution YCoR made to the research through reflective practices.This case study demonstrates how flexible approaches co-production with YCoR can be robust and responsive to balance ethical and epistemological impact in complex mental health research. Supportive, scaffolded practices and safe environments helped build the confidence and capacity of YCoRs to demonstrate valuable phenomenological insights in the analysis. YP's perspectives on how they describe â€˜meaningfulâ€™ and impactful involvement illustrate the reciprocal benefits gained through working together.This case study describes the YCoR involvement throughout the research and dissemination of outputs. YCoR co-authors were involved in developing the outline and reviewing the draft stages of the manuscript.

"Differences in Acceptance to the Kidney Transplant List","Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, kidney transplant (KT) evaluations shifted from in-person evaluation (IPE) to telemedicine evaluation (TME). Given differences in access to electronics and internet, we thought that TME may advantage some social groups' access to the KT list. We evaluated if differences in acceptance to KT listing exist between pre- and post-pandemic eras, or between IPE and TME. We identified associations between other socioeconomic factors and KT listing. Method(s): Demographic and social data were collected from charts of patients evaluated for KT in the pre- (3/13/2019-3/13/2020) and post-pandemic era (3/14/2020- 3/14/2021). Categorical data are presented in proportions and frequencies;continuous data in means+/-SDEV. Independent group t-tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for bivariate comparisons. Result(s): Of 1061 charts, 1015 included data on race/ethnicity: 608 (59.1%) Black, 335 (33.6%) White, 40 (3.9%) Hispanic, 29 (2.8%) Asian, and 3 (0.3%) other. Overall, 629 (59%) evaluations were pre- and 430 (41%) post-pandemic. 734 (72%) were IPE and 288 (28%) TME. 553 (54%) candidates were denied for medical (310, 56%) and social (184, 33%) reasons;469 (46%) were accepted for listing. Employment status was known in 979 candidates: 278 (28%) employed, 368 (38%) disabled, 66 (7%) unemployed, and 267 (27%) retired. Evaluation in the post-pandemic era (p=0.002) was associated with acceptance for listing. TME was also associated with acceptance for listing (p&lt;0.001). Pre-pandemic, there were 604 IPE and 1 TME of whom 253 (42%) were accepted, including the TME (p=0.238). Post-pandemic 130 evaluations were IPE and 287 TME, of whom 215 (52%) were accepted, including 58 (45%) IPE and 157 (55%) TME (p=0.061). Employment status (p&lt;0.001) and mental health status (p=0.009) were associated with acceptance for listing. There was no association between race/ethnicity (p=0.809) or distance from home to the transplant center (p=0.693) and acceptance for listing. There were no differences in race/ ethnicity (p=0.951), employment status (p=0.202), or mental health status (p=0.742) between pre- and post-pandemic eras. Assessment of social support (p=0.002) and overall social work assessment (p&lt;0.001) were associated with acceptance for listing. The level of social support (rated on a 1-5 scale) was associated with being accepted for listing pre-pandemic (p=0.001) but not post-pandemic (p=0.769). Conclusion(s): KT evaluations decreased by about one third during the post-pandemic era. Evaluation in the post-pandemic era, evaluation by TME, employment status, mental health status, assessment of social support and overall social work assessment were all associated with being listed for KT.

To characterise patients experiencing CHS in North America and to obtain a population-based estimate of CHS treatment prevalence in Canada before and during the Covid-19 pandemic METHODS: Internet survey of 157 CHS sufferers in Canada and the United States. Administrative health databases for the province of Alberta (population 5 million) were accessed to measure emergency department (ED) visits for vomiting, with a concurrent diagnostic code for cannabis use. Three time periods of 1Ã‚Â year were assessed: prior to recreational cannabis legalisation (2017-2018), after recreational legalisation (2018-2019) and during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2021). Problematic cannabis use (defined as a CUDIT-R score Ã¢â€°Â¥8) was universal among the survey cohort, and 59% and 68% screening for moderate or worse anxiety or depression, respectively. The overall treatment prevalence of CHS across all ages increased from 15 ED visits per 100,000 population (95% CI, 14-17) prior to legalisation, to 21 (95% CI, 20-23) after legalisation, to 32 (95% CI, 31-35) during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Treatment prevalence amongst chronic cannabis users was as high as 6 per 1000 in the 16-24 age group. Survey data suggest patients with CHS almost universally suffer from a cannabis use disorder, which has significant treatment implications. Treatment prevalence in the ED has increased substantially over a very short time period, with the highest rates seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Andrews, Rehak, Woo, Walker, Ma, Forbes, Rittenbach, Hathaway, Wilsack, Liu, Nasser, Sharkey","https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.17265","20221028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40013,""
"Imaging of Drug-Related Pneumonitis in Oncology","Clinical applications of novel anticancer agents in the past few decades brought marked advances in cancer treatment, enabling remarkable efficacy and effectiveness; however, these novel agents are also associated with toxicities. Among various toxicities, drug-related pneumonitis is one of the major clinical challenges in the management of cancer patients. Imaging plays a key role in detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of drug-related pneumonitis during cancer treatment. In the current era of precision oncology, pneumonitis from molecular targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has been recognized as an event of clinical significance. Additionally, further advances of therapeutic approaches in cancer have brought several emerging issues in diagnosis and monitoring of pneumonitis. This article will describe the computed tomography (CT) pattern-based approach for drug-related pneumonitis that has been utilized to describe the imaging manifestations of pneumonitis from novel cancer therapies. Then, we will discuss pneumonitis from representative agents of precision cancer therapy, including mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, and ICI, focusing on the incidence, risk factors, and the spectrum of CT patterns. Finally, the article will address emerging challenges in the diagnosis and monitoring of pneumonitis, including pneumonitis from combination ICI and radiation therapy and from antibody conjugate therapy, as well as the overlapping imaging features of drug-related pneumonitis and coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. The review is designed to provide a practical overview of drug-related pneumonitis from cutting-edge cancer therapy with emphasis on the role of imaging.","Tseng, Lee, Nishino","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1755569","20221028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40014,""
"Analysis of Emergency Department Encounters Among High Users of Health Care and Social Service Systems Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Although the general US population had fewer emergency department (ED) visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, patterns of use among high users are unknown. To examine natural trends in ED visits among high users of health and social services during an extended period and assess whether these trends differed during COVID-19. This retrospective cohort study combined data from 9 unique cohorts, 1 for each fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) from 2012 to 2021, and used mixed-effects, negative binomial regression to model ED visits over time and assess ED use among the top 5% of high users of multiple systems during COVID-19. Data were obtained from the Coordinated Care Management System, a San Francisco Department of Public Health platform that integrates medical and social information with service use. Fiscal year 2020 was defined as the COVID-19 year. Measured variables were age, gender, language, race and ethnicity, homelessness, insurance status, jail health encounters, mental health and substance use diagnoses, and mortality. The main outcome was annual mean ED visit counts. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were used to describe changes in ED visit rates both over time and in COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 years. Of the 8967 participants, 3289 (36.7%) identified as White, 3005 (33.5%) as Black, and 1513 (16.9%) as Latinx; and 7932 (88.5%) preferred English. The mean (SD) age was 46.7 (14.2) years, 6071 (67.7%) identified as men, and 7042 (78.5%) had experienced homelessness. A statistically significant decrease was found in annual mean ED visits among high users for every year of follow-up until year 8, with the largest decrease occurring in the first year of follow-up (IRR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.40-0.43). However, during the pandemic, ED visits decreased 25% beyond the mean reduction seen in prepandemic years (IRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.72-0.79). In this study, multiple cohorts of the top 5% of high users of multiple health care systems in San Francisco had sustained annual decreases in ED visits from 2012 to 2021, with significantly greater decreases during COVID-19. Further research is needed to elucidate pandemic-specific factors associated with these findings and understand how this change in use was associated with health outcomes.","Molina, Evans, Montoy, Cawley, Graham-Squire, Perez, Raven, Kanzaria","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.39076","20221028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40015,""
"Distress and Satisfaction in Women Who Perceive that Their Male Partners Use Pornography: The Roles of Attitude, Religious Commitment and Conservative Religiosity","Qualitative studies suggest that women's attitudes and religiosity have an important role in their experience of their male partners' pornography use, but these factors have not been adequately studied. The present study examined the contributions of perceived frequency of male partners' solitary pornography use (PFREQ), women's attitudes toward their partners' pornography use, conservative religiosity, and religious commitment to women's pornography-related distress, relationship satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction in women who reported they were married to or cohabitating with men who had used pornography in the prior 3Ã‚Â months (median frequencyÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1-2 times/week). Participants were online research panel participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 625), age meanÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 44[<i>SDÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 13], diverse SES, 86% White. Partial correlations and multiple regressions, controlling for demographic variables and COVID-19-related stress, indicated that higher PFREQ and negative attitudes toward pornography were significantly associated with women's higher pornography-related distress, lower relationship satisfaction, and lower sexual satisfaction. Moderation analyses found that negative attitude amplified the negative association between PFREQ and relationship satisfaction, and conservative religiosity amplified the positive association between PFREQ and pornography-related distress. Neither attitude nor religious factors moderated the negative association between PFREQ and sexual satisfaction. Findings suggest that attitude, religious factors, and PFREQ are each important to consider in research and clinical contexts.","Ruffing, Brody, Sandage","https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2022.2137097","20221028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40016,""
"Controlled Substance Prescription History among Individuals Who Died of an Accidental Opioid-Involved Drug Overdose in Rhode Island","<i>Background:</i> Accidental opioid-involved overdose deaths are increasing nationally in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is unclear if this reflects a change in populations most at risk. <i>Objective:</i> To determine whether the demographic characteristics and controlled substance prescription history of accidental opioid-involved drug overdose decedents in 2020 differed from prior years. <i>Methods:</i> We identified accidental opioid-involved overdose decedents using Rhode Island (RI) State Medical Examiner's Office data. Decedents were linked to the RI Prescription Drug Monitoring Program database. We compared demographic characteristics and prescription history by year of death. <i>Results:</i> From 2018 to 2020, 763 RI residents died from accidental opioid-involved overdose in RI. From 2018 to 2019, deaths decreased by 7%, but then increased by 31% from 2019 to 2020. Demographic characteristics were similar by year of death (all <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The percentage of decedents with a prior opioid prescription and a prior benzodiazepine prescription declined from 2018 to 2020 (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01 and <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). <i>Conclusions:</i> We found that opioid-involved overdose deaths in RI are increasing overall, but without significant changes in demographics. While prior exposure to some controlled substances did decline over time, it is not clear if these changes reflect more responsible prescribing practices, or a more concerning pattern such as patient abandonment or decreased healthcare access. More studies are needed to better describe the current trend of increasing opioid-involved deaths while also pursuing current evidence-based interventions.","Siegert, Chambers, Weidele, Scagos, McDonald, Onyejekwe, Hallowell","https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2022.2137814","20221028","Opioid; Rhode Island; buprenorphine; controlled substance; overdose; prescription history","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40017,""
"Facing the pandemic with a smile: the case of Memedical and its impact on cardiovascular professionals","Since its outbreak, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has profoundly changed the world we were acquainted with. After the first known contact with humankind in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the reckless spread of such pathogen put the healthcare system to the test, leading to harmful consequences affecting human lives in every aspect. As of February 2022, the death toll amounts to almost 6 million deaths, but the pathogenic profile of SARS-CoV2 goes way beyond the mere biological interaction between the viral particle and our organism. People had to deal with the severe psychological impact caused by the only available weapon to fight this infection, i.e., social distancing. The human psychological profile has been strained with repercussions we still are unaware of nowadays. Healthcare professionals were among the most hit categories, not only because of the quarantine but above all for the situations they had to bear every day, constantly facing desperation, death, isolation, and rage. In such circumstances, social media represented a powerful shelter, giving people the ability to keep in contact and to feel connected even if miles apart. In our country, the power of communication was strongly emphasized by launching an Italian Facebook group called Memedical, where members can share ironic memes to feel closer and give a glimmer of happiness in such a challenging moment. Our review highlights the severity of this pandemic's impact, deteriorating the global population's physical and mental health, and shows how wise use of social media can benefit the quality of life.","Cecchini, Schino, Gambadoro, Ricciardi, Trio, Biondi-Zoccai, Sangiorgi","https://doi.org/10.23736/S2724-5683.22.06079-3","20221028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40018,""
"Health-Related Quality of Life and Associated Factors Among Covid-19 Survivors Experience from Ethiopian Treatment Centers","The pandemic of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19), which is extremely stressful and has an adverse effect on people's health-related quality of life (HRQoL), poses a serious threat to global public health. As a result, this study evaluated the health-related quality of life and associated factors among Covid-19 patients who were discharged from Ethiopian treatment centers. We conducted a multi-center, cross-sectional study among 493 Covid-19 survivors who had been discharged from treatment centers between 1st January 2020, and 20th October 2021. We collected respondents' data using validated Amharic version EuroQol 5-dimensional-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire along with medical records of the patients. Differences in HRQOL scores between patient subgroups were tested by Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis test, and the multivariable betaMix regression was used to investigate factors associated with HRQOL scores. The EQ-5D and VAS median score for Covid-19 survivors was 0.940 (IQR: 0.783-0.966) and 87 (IQR: 70-91) respectively. Overall, married individuals, old-aged, individuals who had low educational status, high monthly income, comorbidities, admitted to the Intensive care Unit, received intranasal oxygen care, and prolonged hospitalization had lower utility scores and EQ-VAS scores compared to their counterparts. In multivariate betaMix regression, respondents' health status at admission, old age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and hospital length of stay were significantly associated with the lower EQ-5D-Index value and EQ-VAS score. We found that Covid-19 infection had a persisting impact on the physical and psychosocial health of Covid-19 survivors. Age, having asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, having a worsening health state upon admission, and a prolonged hospital length of stay were significantly associated with the lower EQ-5D and EQ-VAS score. Therefore, the cost-effective psychological treatment such as cognitive behaviour therapy should be encouraged after hospitalization to improve the post-Covid-19 depression and fatigue.","Kaso, Tesema, Hareru, Kaso, Ashuro, Talemahu, Jore, Kassa, Agero, Hailu","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S386566","20221028","Covid-19; Ethiopia; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40019,""

The aim was to identify groups of individuals based on their beliefs about COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to compare the groups identified in terms of psychological characteristics associated such as automatic defense mechanisms, coping strategies, powerlessness, emotions, emotional regulation, attitudes toward the COVID-19, social distancing discontent, perceptions of COVID-19 severity and temporal perspective. A k-mean cluster analysis identified the groups of Believers (22.26%), Ambivalent believers (34.3%), and Non-believers (43.21%).

"Effect of Lockdown Due to COVID-19 on Health and Lifestyle of Psoriasis Patients: A Web-Based Survey","Chronic skin diseases like psoriasis affect a patient's physical, psychological, and social functioning as well as well-being, and the lockdown acted as a cofactor in further worsening the quality of life in psoriasis patients. The objective of the study is to assess the effect of lockdown on the health, lifestyle, and mental well-being of psoriasis patients. A cross-sectional study was done using an online questionnaire shared through messenger applications to the patients of chronic plaque psoriasis who registered in the psoriasis clinic between August 2020 and December 2020. Data regarding demographics, psoriasis, lifestyle changes, mental status, financial loss, and problems faced during lockdown were collected. Our study included 181 completed questionnaires. The mean age was 37.7 (SD 13.9) years, and 124 (68.5%) were males. Sixty-five (35.9%) patients reported worsening of their psoriasis during the lockdown.

This study aims to assess the prevalence and determinants of mental health conditions in offshore oil platform workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers of three oil and gas platforms were assessed in this cross-sectional study. Their mental status was evaluated by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD-8) questionnaire, and Depression Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) questionnaires. Furthermore, we assessed satisfaction with life (SWL) with a single question. Finally, multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of demographic and work-related variables with mental health outcomes. Overall, 278 (Males:197, Females: 81) out of 315 invited workers with a mean age of 35.6 (SD: 7.2) years were included in this study using a random sampling method (participation rate: 88.2%).

"Physical activity and mental health in sports university students during the COVID-19 school confinement in Shanghai","In 2022, Shanghai was seriously affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The government implemented citywide static management for 2 months, as well as all universities in Shanghai, which changed the normal learning and living style of sports students and led to a decline in physical activity level. As the physical activity has a strong correlation with mental health, this study aimed to investigate the current state of physical activity (PA) and mental health of the students in Shanghai University of Sport. It will try to reveal the correlation between PA and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19 and smartphone addiction. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a random sample of 400 students who came from six different majors in May 2022 at the Shanghai University of Sport. Respondents completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), the Chinese version of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Chinese version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Chinese version of the COVID-19 Fear Scale (FCV- 19S), and the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS-SV). Demographics, PA, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19, and smartphone addiction were compared. A binary logistic regression model was used for the further analysis. A total of 376 college students were included in the final analysis. Binary logistics analysis showed that moderate physical activity (MPA) was negatively correlated with depression (OR = 0.95, 95%CI = 0.93-0.98), anxiety (OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.95-0.99), fear of COVID 19(OR = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.98-0.99)and smartphone addiction (OR = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.9-0.98) (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Sedentary behavior was positively correlated with smartphone addiction (OR = 1.01, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01, 95%CI = 1.001-1.004). There was an association between the presence of MPA and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19, smartphone addiction, and sedentary behavior associated with smartphone addiction levels. Clarifying the causal relationship between PA and mental health will require further research.","Wang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.977072","20221028","COVID-19; confinement; mental health; physical activities; sports university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40026,""
"Isolating together during COVID-19: Results from the Telehealth Intervention Program for older adults","A pressing challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond is to provide accessible and scalable mental health support to isolated older adults in the community. The Telehealth Intervention Program for Older Adults (TIP-OA) is a large-scale, volunteer-based, friendly telephone support program designed to address this unmet need. A prospective cohort study of 112 TIP-OA participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years old was conducted in Quebec, Canada (October 2020-June 2021). The intervention consisted of weekly friendly phone calls from trained volunteers. The primary outcome measures included changes in scores of stress, depression, anxiety, and fear surrounding COVID-19, assessed at baseline, 4 and 8-weeks. Additional subgroup analyses were performed with participants with higher baseline scores. The subgroup of participants with higher baseline depression scores (PHQ9 Ã¢â€°Â¥10) had significant improvements in depression scores over the 8-week period measured [mean change score = -2.27 (Ã‚Â±4.76), 95%CI (-3.719, -0.827), <i>p</i> = 0.003]. Similarly, participants with higher baseline anxiety scores (GAD7 Ã¢â€°Â¥10) had an improvement over the same period, which, approached significance (<i>p</i> = 0.06). Moreover, despite peaks in the pandemic and related stressors, our study found no significant (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.09) increase in stress, depression, anxiety or fear of COVID-19 scores. This scalable, volunteer-based, friendly telephone intervention program was associated with decreased scores of depression and anxiety in older adults who reported higher scores at baseline (PHQ 9 Ã¢â€°Â¥10 and GAD7 Ã¢â€°Â¥10).","Sekhon, Lavin, Vacaflor, Rigas, Cinalioglu, Su, Bodenstein, Dikaios, Goodman, Raymond, Ibrahim, Bein, Gruber, Se, Sasi, Walsh, Nazar, Hanganu, Berkani, Royal, Schiavetto, Looper, Launay, McDonald, Seitz, Kumar, Beauchet, Khoury, Bouchard, Battistini, Fallavollita, Miresco, Bruneau, Vahia, Bukhari, Rej","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.948506","20221028","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; isolation; mental health support; older adults; stress; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40027,""
"Potential risk factors for acute grief during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of avoidance processes","Bereavement during the COVID-19 pandemic may have some unique characteristics that become potential risk factors (e.g., absence of grief rituals, no opportunity to say goodbye to the deceased, and loneliness caused by social distancing) for acute grief. Avoidance processes could be significant mediators in the context of the pandemic. The current study aimed to investigate whether and how these COVID-19-related risk factors were related to acute grief severity. Bereaved adults (n = 319) who lost significant others during the COVID-19 pandemic completed a self-report questionnaire package measuring COVID-19-related factors, grief severity, and depressive and anxious avoidance. Regression analyses suggested that among the three potential risk factors (loneliness, grief rituals, and opportunity to say goodbye), loneliness was significantly associated with acute grief after controlling for basic demographic and loss-related information. Structural equation models suggested that depressive avoidance and anxious avoidance partially mediated the associations of loneliness with acute grief severity. The findings indicate that dealing with loss during the COVID-19 pandemic warrants further exploration concerning how potential environmental risk factors may impede adaptation to loss. Depressive and anxious avoidance processes may play important roles in grief interventions for isolated and lonely bereaved people.","Zou, Xu, Tang, Jiao, Qian, Shen, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2794","20221028","COVID-19; acute grief; anxious avoidance; depressive avoidance; loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40028,""
"Future public health emergencies and disasters: sustainability and insights into support programs for healthcare providers","The mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been at the forefront throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. While workplace-based support programs have been developed in hospitals globally, few systematically collected data. While critical to their success, information on these programs and the experience of mental healthcare providers (MHP) who support colleagues is limited. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of MHP caring for HCW colleagues within a novel workplace-based mental health support program during the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide insights on facilitators, areas for improvement and barriers to program sustainability. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews conducted by videoconference between September 2020 to October 2021. UHN CARES (University Health Network Coping and Resilience for Employees and Staff) Program was developed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. It supports over 21,000 staff members within the UHN, Canada's largest academic health research institution, in Toronto, Canada. Purposive sampling was used to select 10 of the 22 MHP in the UHN CARES Program (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10). Using a critical realism framework, key components required to sustain a successful workplace-based mental health support program for HCWs and balance the needs of MHP were determined. Six psychiatrists and four psychologists (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) with varying roles at UHN participated in 17 interviews, including seven repeat interviews exploring changes over time within the pandemic and program. Components which facilitated the success of the program included flexibility in scheduling, confidential health record storage, comprehensive administrative support, availability of resources and adaptive quality improvement approach. Recommendations for improvement included opportunities for peer supervision, triaging of cases, and managing HCW expectations. MHP found caring for HCWs to be meaningful and they utilized existing clinical skills during sessions. Challenges included working in a virtual setting, navigating boundaries when caring for colleagues, and managing the range of service users and their needs. These findings suggest how support programs can be structured for HCWs, how to provide support, and how to sustain this support, allowing health systems to balance the needs of HCWs and MHPs in preparation for future public health emergencies.","Dhuper, Ruttan, MacGillvray, McKay, Li, Stewart, Abbey, Berkhout, Sheehan, Schulz-Quach","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04309-z","20221028","COVID-19 pandemic; Disaster; Emergency; Healthcare delivery; Healthcare workers; Mental health provider; Mental health supports; Work and Mental Health; Workplace-based programs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40029,""
"Trajectories of resilience and mental distress to global major disruptions","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a major societal disruption, raising the question of how people can maintain or quickly regain their mental health (i.e., be resilient) during such times. Researchers have used the pandemic as a use case for studying resilience in response to a global, synchronously starting, and chronic set of stressors on the individual and societal level. Our review of this recent literature reveals that mental distress trajectories during the pandemic largely resemble mental distress responses to individual-level macro-stressors, except for a lower prevalence of recovery trajectories. Results suggest more resilient responses in older adults, but trajectories are less consistent for younger and older ages compared with middle-aged adults. We call for more research integrating state-of-the-art operationalizations of resilience and using these to study resilience over the lifespan.","SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Kunzler, Kalisch, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Lieb","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2022.09.017","20221027","lifespan; mental health; resilience; resilience factors; stressor; trajectories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40030,""

"Digital interventions to reduce social isolation and loneliness in older adults: An evidence and gap map","Background: Social isolation and loneliness are more common in older adults and are associated with a serious impact on their well-being, mental health, physical health, and longevity. They are a public health concern highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, hence the need for digital technology tools to enable remotely delivered interventions to alleviate the impact of social isolation and loneliness during the COVID-19 restrictions. Objectives: To map available evidence on the effects of digital interventions to mitigate social isolation and/or loneliness in older adults in all settings except hospital settings. Search methods: We searched the following databases from inception to 16 May 2021 with no language restrictions: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo via Ovid, CINAHL via EBSCO, Web of Science via Clarivate, ProQuest (all databases), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS) via ProQuest, EBSCO (all databases except CINAHL), Global Index Medicus, and Epistemonikos. Selection criteria: Titles and abstracts and full text of potentially eligible articles were independently screened in duplicate following the eligibility criteria. Data collection and analysis: We developed and pilot tested a data extraction code set in Eppi-Reviewer and data was individually extracted and coded. Main results: We included 200 articles (103 primary studies and 97 systematic reviews) that assessed the effects of digital interventions to reduce social isolation and/or loneliness in older adults. Most of the systematic reviews (72%) were classified as critically low quality, only 2% as high quality and 25% were published since the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence is unevenly distributed with clusters predominantly in high-income countries and none in low-income countries. The most common interventions identified are digital interventions to enhance social interactions with family and friends and the community via videoconferencing and telephone calls. Digital interventions to enhance social support, particularly socially assistive robots, and virtual pets were also common. Most interventions focused on reducing loneliness and depression and improving quality of life of older adults. Major gaps were identified in community level outcomes and process indicators. No included studies or reviews assessed affordability or digital divide although the value of accessibility and barriers caused by digital divide were discussed in three primary studies and three reviews. Adverse effects were reported in only two studies and six reviews. No study or review included participants from the LGBTQIA2S+ community and only one study restricted participants to 80 years and older. Very few described how at-risk populations were recruited or conducted any equity analysis to assess differences in effects for populations experiencing inequities across PROGRESS-Plus categories. Authors' conclusions: The restrictions placed on people during the pandemic have shone a spotlight onto social isolation and loneliness, particularly for older adults. This evidence and gap map shows available evidence on the effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing social isolation or loneliness in older adults. Although the evidence is relatively large and recent, it is unevenly distributed and there is need for more high-quality research. This map can guide researchers and funders to consider areas of major gaps as priorities for further research.","Vivian Welch et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00E1-5A9-95A","20221029","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; evidence and gap map; social isolation; digital interventions; loneliness; older adults","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","",40035,""
