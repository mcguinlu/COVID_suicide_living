"Evaluating telephone psychological therapy within a specialist palliative care team during the COVID19 pandemic","BackgroundThe emergence of the Covid19 pandemic in March 2019 necessitated the move from entirely face to face Clinical Psychology provision within the Coventry Specialist Palliative Care team (SPCT), to virtual consultations only. Swift adaption of service provision was essential in a rapidly changing situation and in the best interests of a vulnerable patient population. Virtual approaches were initially via telephone, incorporating videoconferencing platforms once safe systems were established. During this time, virtual psychological therapy became treatment as usual. Research on remote working is sparse but largely encouraging (Markowitz et al, 2021;Lenfernick, Meyerbroker & Boelen, 2020;Morland et al, 2020). This is a small-scale qualitative evaluation of service users experience of using telephone support during the pandemic.MethodFive participants were selected for inclusion. Inclusion criteria comprised all patients who were well enough and who had received telephone psychological intervention during this timeframe. Consent was gained by a trainee psychologist, via telephone. This was to ensure that participants could talk freely about the psychologist that they had worked with. Questions included: what went well;what went less well;what approach patients would choose given a choice;speed of response time considerations on choice;impact on therapeutic rapport;and future suggestions.ResultsAll respondents reported that they found telephone support helpful. Participants felt it did not impact upon therapeutic rapport. Benefits include ease of access to psychologist and shorter wait time. Suggestions were made for future blended approaches, incorporating virtual and face to face options.ConclusionThe sample size is small;however, this is an ongoing challenge within palliative populations given complex and unstable physical health. This is a promising start in understanding how virtual approaches can better support psychological provision in the SPCT. Benefits include shorter wait time. Future evaluation of videoconferencing and mixed approaches is recommended.ReferencesBPS Guidance: Returning to the workplace. Safety considerations for practicing psychologists.

"Cyberbullying prevalence in Australian adolescents: Time trends 2015-2020","Cyberbullying is a major issue during adolescence;however, little is known about trends in its prevalence, or how the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted these trends. This study investigated how the prevalence of cyberbullying and associated factors (depression, social anxiety, and coping self-efficacy) have changed from 2015 to 2020. The study used self-report data from Australian high-school students (n =Â 1418) aged 11â€“16Â years, collected yearly from 2015 to 2020. Findings showed that while prevalence of cyber victimization increased over time, prevalence of cyber perpetration did not. However, sharp rises of both cyber victimization and cyber perpetration were noted during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. While no increases in mental health difficulties were reported in 2020, increases in cyberbullying and decreases in coping self-efficacy are concerning.

"A core outcome set for post-COVID-19 condition in adults for use in clinical practice and research: an international Delphi consensus study","Health consequences that persist beyond the acute infection phase of COVID-19, termed post-COVID-19 condition (also commonly known as long COVID), vary widely and represent a growing global health challenge. Research on post-COVID-19 condition is expanding but, at present, no agreement exists on the health outcomes that should be measured in people living with the condition. To address this gap, we conducted an international consensus study, which included a comprehensive literature review and classification of outcomes for post-COVID-19 condition that informed a two-round online modified Delphi process followed by an online consensus meeting to finalise the core outcome set (COS). 1535 participants from 71 countries were involved, with 1148 individuals participating in both Delphi rounds. Eleven outcomes achieved consensus for inclusion in the final COS: fatigue; pain; post-exertion symptoms; work or occupational and study changes; survival; and functioning, symptoms, and conditions for each of cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous system, cognitive, mental health, and physical outcomes. Recovery was included a priori because it was a relevant outcome that was part of a previously published COS on COVID-19. The next step in this COS development exercise will be to establish the instruments that are most appropriate to measure these core outcomes. This international consensus-based COS should provide a framework for standardised assessment of adults with post-COVID-19 condition, aimed at facilitating clinical care and research worldwide.","Munblit, Nicholson, Akrami, Apfelbacher, Chen, De Groote, Diaz, Gorst, Harman, Kokorina, Olliaro, Parr, Preller, Schiess, Schmitt, Seylanova, Simpson, Tong, Needham, Williamson, Guekht, Semple, Warner, Sigfrid, Scott, DunnGalvin, Genuneit, Buonsenso, Sivan, Siegerink, Klok, Avdeev, Stavropoulou, Michelen, Aiyegbusi, Calvert, Hughes, Haroon, Fregonese, Carson, Knauss, O'Hara, Marshall, Herridge, Murthy, Vos, Wulf Hanson, Parker, O'Brien, Lerner, Chevinsky, Unger, Eisinger, Hough, Saydah, Frontera, Rosa, Cao, Bhatnagar, Thiruvengadam, Seahwag, Bouraoui, Van Kerkhove, Dua, Relan, Soriano Ortiz","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00169-2","20220617","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33035,""
"Human Social Isolation and Stress: A Systematic Review of Different Contexts and Recommendations for Future Studies","The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns and social distancing measures adopted worldwide raised questions about the possible health effects of human social isolation. We conducted a systematic review on PubMed, Scopus and Embase electronic databases using terms related to human social isolation - defined as the isolation of an individual from regular routines and usual social contact - and psychological stress, searching for simulated or naturalistic isolation environments. We present the main results, as well as the validity and limitations of each model. PROSPERO registry number: CRD42021241880. Despite the diversity of contexts reviewed, some outcomes almost ubiquitously relate to psychological stress, i.e. longer periods, expectation of a longer period, confinement, lack of social interaction and support. Based on the results, considering that most studies were not designed for the purpose of understanding isolation itself, we propose a group of recommendations for future experimental or naturalistic research on the topic. Evidence on the impact of different situations in which individuals are subjected to social isolation can assist in the development of directed preventive strategies to support people under similar circumstances. Such strategies might increase the compliance of the general public to social distancing as a non-pharmacological intervention for emerging infectious diseases.","Tonon, Abreu, Silva, Tavares, Nishino, Versignassi, Amando, Constantino, Pilz, Steibel, Suchecki, Amaral, Hidalgo","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0452","20220617","Psychiatry; anxiety; depression; lockdown; social connection; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33036,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Resilience Among Chinese Adolescents and Its Influential Factors: A Longitudinal Study","The current study assessed the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on resilience among Chinese adolescents and explored its influential factors. A total of 2,359 students were recruited from three middle schools through cluster randomization in Chengdu. Data were collected before and after home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Resilience, family function, and effect of the pandemic were measured using subscales of the Chinese Positive Youth Development Scale, Chinese Family Assessment Instrument, and Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale. Paired samples <i>t</i> test showed resilience decreased significantly after confinement. According to stepwise multiple linear regression, basal resilience, family dysfunction, higher frequencies of hyperarousal symptoms of posttraumatic stress, increased electronic device use, and relationship with care-givers were independent influential factors of resilience. COVID-19 negatively affected adolescents' resilience; therefore, stakeholders need to focus on improving resilience in this population to mitigate mental health impacts of acute stressful events.

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal: The role of personality traits and emotion regulation strategies","Recent evidence suggests that both personality traits (PT) and emotion regulation (ER) strategies play an important role in the way people cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was two folded. First, to longitudinally investigate the psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress levels) taking in consideration PT and ER strategies in 3 different moments: during the first lockdown period (April/20), at the first deconfinement (May/20) and 1-month after the first deconfinement (Jun/20)-Experiment I. Second, to cross-sectionally evaluate the impact of the pandemic in psychological distress and the correlates with PT and ER 6-months after the first deconfinement November/20 to February/21 -Experiment II. A total of 722 volunteers (Experiment I = 180; Experiment II = 542) aged 18 years or older participated in this online survey. The findings from Experiment I show that psychological distress decreased after the lockdown period, however, neuroticism traits predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, while difficulties in ER strategies were identified as a risk factor for depression and stress. For experiment II, neuroticism traits and being infected with COVID-19 were associated to higher levels of symptomatology, while unemployment and the use of emotional suppression strategies to cope with emotional situations were associated to depressive and anxiety symptoms. Although the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak decreased over time in our sample, the current findings suggest that difficulties in emotional regulation and high levels of neuroticism traits might be potential risk factors for psychiatric symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, people with difficulties in ER and neuroticism traits would benefit from psychological interventions that provide personality-appropriate support and promote emotion regulation skills during stressful events, such as the case of the global pandemic.","Kluwe-Schiavon, De Zorzi, Meireles, Leite, Sequeira, Carvalho","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269496","20220620","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33038,""
"Nurses' mental health and coping strategies throughout COVID-19 outbreak: A nationwide qualitative study","This qualitative exploratory study explored nurses' mental health and coping strategies working with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients in Brunei Darussalam. Eleven focus group discussions were conducted between October 2020 and January 2021, involving 75 participants. Three themes emerged: 'COVID-19 roller-coaster transitional journey' explained the different psychological responses of the journey of the nurses from merely hearing about COVID-19 from far to the invasion of the virus and community outbreak in the country; 'Mind my mind and heart' share experiences of the nurses in terms of their mental health and emotional responses; and 'the psychosocial system' described the coping mechanisms of the nurses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses' mental health and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced how they provided care and performed other tasks, which should not be taken for granted. Nurses employed psychosocial coping methods at the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and support from family, friends, the public, and the governmental level. This research is fundamental as a basis for other countries to design psychological interventions during this yet unsettled COVID-19 pandemic.","Maideen, Idris, Lupat, Chung, Haji-Badarudin, Suhai, Abdullah, Omar, Kisut, Abdul Rahman, Abdul-Mumin","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13031","20220617","Brunei; COVID-19; coping; mental health; nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33039,""
"Body temperature variation controls pre-mRNA processing and transcription of antiviral genes and SARS-CoV-2 replication","Antiviral innate immunity represents the first defense against invading viruses and is key to control viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Body temperature is an omnipresent variable but was neglected when addressing host defense mechanisms and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that increasing temperature in a 1.5Ã‚Â°C window, between 36.5 and 38Ã‚Â°C, strongly increases the expression of genes in two branches of antiviral immunity, nitric oxide production and type I interferon response. We show that alternative splicing coupled to nonsense-mediated decay decreases STAT2 expression in colder conditions and suggest that increased STAT2 expression at elevated temperature induces the expression of diverse antiviral genes and SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. This cascade is activated in a remarkably narrow temperature range below febrile temperature, which reflects individual, circadian and age-dependent variation. We suggest that decreased body temperature with aging contributes to reduced expression of antiviral genes in older individuals. Using cell culture and in vivo models, we show that higher body temperature correlates with reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication, which may affect the different vulnerability of children versus seniors toward severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altogether, our data connect body temperature and pre-mRNA processing to provide new mechanistic insight into the regulation of antiviral innate immunity.","Los, PreuÃƒÅ¸ner, Eschke, Vidal, Abdelgawad, Olofsson, Keiper, Paulo-Pedro, Grindel, Meinke, Trimpert, Heyd","https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac513","20220617","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33040,""
"The effect of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health, gut microbiota composition and serum cortisol levels","The aim of this study was to assess changes in mental health, gut microbiota composition, and stress marker serum cortisol due to COVID-19 lockdown in asymptomatic individuals. Healthy adults participated in anthropometric measurements, blood and stool sample collection pre-lockdown and post-lockdown (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38, 63.2% females), lifestyle and psychological questionnaires were included in pre-lockdown measurement and lockdown survey (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°46, 67.4% females). Subjects reported significantly higher body dissatisfaction (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007) and anxiety (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002), and significantly lower positive affect (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown. According to perceived stress, 51.6% of females and 20% of males experienced moderate to high stress. This was reflected in serum cortisol levels that significantly increased only in females (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) post-lockdown and correlated with perceived stress (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.037) and anxiety (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031). In addition to psychological measures, changes in gut microbiota composition were observed. Gut microbial alpha diversity significantly decreased (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.033), whereas relative abundance of Proteobacteria significantly increased (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.043) post-lockdown.

"Mental Health Outcomes of Perceived Stress, Anxiety, Fear and Insomnia, and the Resilience among Frontline Nurses Caring for Critical COVID-19 Patients in Intensive Care Units","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a significant disruption in healthcare delivery and poses a unique long-term stressor among frontline nurses. Hence, the investigators planned to explore the adverse mental health outcomes and the resilience of frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients admitted in intensive care units (ICUs). A cross-sectional online survey using Google form consisted of questionnaires on perceived stress scale (PSS-10), generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), Fear Scale for Healthcare Professionals regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, insomnia severity index, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC) were administered among the nurses working in COVID ICUs of a tertiary care center in North India. A considerable number of subjects in the study reported symptoms of distress (68.5%), anxiety (54.7%), fear (44%), and insomnia (31%). Resilience among the frontline nurses demonstrated a moderate to a high level with a mean percentage score of 77.5 (31.23 Ã‚Â± 4.68). A negative correlation was found between resilience and adverse mental outcomes; hence, resilience is a reliable tool to mitigate the adverse psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emphasizing the well-being of the nurses caring for critical COVID-19 patients during the pandemic is necessary to enable them to provide high-quality nursing care.

"On Patterns of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review of Case Reports","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has various neuropsychiatric manifestations, including psychotic, mood, anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, and cognitive disorders, such as delirium. Although the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to an increase in psychiatric comorbidities, the COVID-19 virus is also an independent risk factor. Previous studies have revealed that the virus can invade the neural tissue, which causes an imbalance of neurotransmitters that cause neuropsychiatric symptoms.Ã‚Â The aim of this article is to conduct a systematic review to determine the patterns of neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19, discussing the frequency and its impact on pre-existing psychiatric disorders. Thirty-nine case reports were collected and analyzed for a systematic review. They were full-text, peer-reviewed journal publications from November 2020 to February 2021.Ã‚Â Fifty-three patients were included in our study. The most frequent symptom was abnormal/bizarre behavior (50.9%), followed by agitation/aggression (49.1%), and the third most common was altered mental status and delirium (47.2%). Only 48% of our patients had a pre-existing psychiatric disorder, including three not formally diagnosed but displayed psychiatric symptoms prior to the COVID-19 infection. Findings suggest a positive correlation of new-onset psychiatric symptoms with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the exact pathophysiology of the virus itself causing neuropsychiatric manifestations needs to be investigated further.","Idehen, Kazi, Quainoo-Acquah, Sperry, Zaman, Goodarzi, Chida, Nalbandyan, Hernandez, Sharma, Mulume, Okoh, Okonkwo, Harrison, Soetan, Iqbal, Lesniowska, Baloch, Jolayemi","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.25004","20220617","coronavirus; covid-19; mental health and covid-19; psychiatric symptoms of covid-19; psychiatry and covid-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33046,""
"A Study on the Effect of the Pre-Go-Live Training in Anxiety and Depression of Medical Staff Based on the Data of Wuhan Fangcang Shelter Hospital During COVID-19 in the Era of Big Data","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in 2019. In the past 4 years, China has adopted many measures to control the epidemic, including building Fangcang shelter hospitals to isolate confirmed positive cases. Therefore, we aim to explore the mental health status of medical staff in the Wuhan Fangcang shelter hospital and discuss the relevant factors that affect the medical staff's mental status. The subjects of the research were staff from several Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan during the epidemic of COVID-19. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items Scale (PHQ-9) was used to assess the severity of the participants' depressive symptoms, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items Scale (GAD-7) was used to evaluate the severity of the participants' anxiety symptoms. The demographic information and health adjustment methods were collected in a self-made questionnaire, and regression analysis on related factors that affect mental health was performed. The three most frequently used methods of psychological adjustment for the staff in the Fangcang shelter hospital are common recreational activities, such as reading, streaming videos, listening to music, and playing games. (93.8%), communicating with colleagues in the Fangcang shelter hospital (92.5%), and communicating with family members and friends (78.3%). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that developing depression symptoms has relation to 2 factors, which are having not participated in medical emergency rescue missions (odds ratio = 2.610; 95% confidence interval 1.398-4.872, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and inadequate training before entering the shelter hospital (odds ratio = 2.804, 95% confidence interval 1.293-6.08, <i>P</i> = 0.009). Compared with adequate pre-job training, insufficient training increases the risk of anxiety symptoms (odds ratio = 2.692; 95% confidence interval 1.3-5.575, <i>P</i> = 0.008). Lack of experience and inadequate training in medical emergency rescue missions exposed the medical staff to a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Psychological adjustment methods that are helpful to adjust their mental state are most commonly used.","Feng, Zhou, Wang, Kang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.909241","20220620","COVID-19; Fangcang shelter hospital; health psychology; mental health care; public health; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Big Data; COVID-19; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Medical Staff; Mobile Health Units; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33047,""
"Ethical by Design: Engaging the Community to Co-design a Digital Health Ecosystem to Improve Overdose Prevention Efforts Among Highly Vulnerable People Who Use Drugs","The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant structural barriers that exacerbated health inequities among people at-risk for overdose. Digital health technologies have the potential to overcome some of these barriers; however, development of these technologies often fails to include people who use drugs and community key stakeholders in the development and dissemination process. Consequently, this may exacerbate health inequities and the digital divide among underserved, highly vulnerable people who use drugs. The current study employed community-engaged research methods to develop and implement a digital platform to improve overdose surveillance among harm reductionists in Texas. We used a co-design process with four community advisory boards (CABs) and conducted qualitative interviews among <i>N</i> = 74 key stakeholders (<i>n</i> = 24 people who use drugs; <i>n</i> = 20 first responders, <i>n</i> = 20 harm reductionists, <i>n</i> = 10 overdose prevention and response experts) to inform initial design and development. Several key themes emerged through the qualitative data pertaining to technical features and human factors applications. In regards to technical features, participants highlighted the importance of developing a unified system of overdose reporting and data sharing among community organizations within a county or region to better inform overdose surveillance and community outreach efforts. This system should include flexible data entry methods, have offline usage capability, be user friendly, and allow for tracking of overdose-related supply distribution. Key human factor themes included the need to use person-centered language, to preserve the established trust of the community organizations among people who use drugs, to be tailored to specific target user groups (e.g., harm reduction workers, people who use drugs, first responders), and maintain transparency of data usage. Further, participants noted the importance of developing a platform that will facilitate client conversations about overdose when doing outreach in the field. These themes were reviewed by our CABs, academic, and industry partners to design an overdose digital platform uniquely tailored to community-based organizations providing harm reduction and overdose response efforts. Community engagement throughout the development process is critical toward developing digital health tools for underserved people who use drugs. Dismantling the power structure among academic and industry partners is critical toward creating equity in engagement of community-based partners, particularly among persons with lived experience in addiction, a history of incarceration, or financial challenges. Our study highlights a multisectoral co-design process across community-academic-industry partners to develop a digital health tool tailored to the unique needs of community-based harm reduction organizations serving highly vulnerable people who use drugs. These partnerships are essential toward creating impact and reducing health disparities among highly vulnerable people who use drugs.","Claborn, Creech, Whittfield, Parra-Cardona, Daugherty, Benzer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.880849","20220617","community engaged research; harm reduction; human factor; overdose prevention; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33048,""
"Research of the Changes in the Psychological Status of Chinese University Students and the Influencing Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Psychological dynamics of college students have changed during the COVID-19 outbreak but little research has been done in this area. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dynamic changes in the mental health status of college students since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic 1 year and the influencing factors. The research period was from February 2020 to August 2021. 384 college students were analyzed three times during this period on the recognition and psychological state of the pandemic. During the period from February 2020 to August 2021, in general, the positive scores rose from 20.79 to 23.46, while the negative scores dropped from 17.41 to 14.00. The regression analysis results on the influencing factors showed the degree of recognition of the pandemic is all significant in the three phases (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). With the effective control of the pandemic, the mental state of the students showed a slight improvement in the environment of sporadic cases.

"Social Media as Online Shelter: Psychological Relief in COVID-19 Pandemic Diaries","The pandemic diary on social media is a special form of online communication. Studying individual narratives in social networks during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods can help us generate valuable knowledge about the behaviors of media users and the function of social media in a public health crisis. This research focuses on psychological relief in virtual public spaces and explores how social media individual narratives affect people's psychological health in a state of emergency from the perspective of narrative theory. Based on 19 in-depth interviews with Chinese diary writers, it has been found that the narrative genres of the pandemic diary were mainly Restitution and Quest narrative, while a few were categorized as ""Restrained chaos"" narrative. The purpose of editing pandemic diaries is to communicate both inwardly and outwardly. The pandemic diary can promote self-relief, public communication, emotional drive, meaning connection, and identity construction in public spaces, thus helping shape a sense of unity and belonging, and facilitating the psychological reconstruction of people who are vulnerable to potential mental health crises.","Feng, Feng, Ivanov","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.882264","20220617","COVID-19 pandemic; individual narrative; pandemic diary; psychological relief; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33050,""

The participants were INTEGRA Foundation kindergarten directors, from a sample of 567 kindergartens in Chile. To measure the technostress manifestations, the RED-TIC questionnaire was used as an instrument, and concerning techno-creators and techno-inhibitors, those established in previous research were considered. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) methodology was used, and the model estimation was performed using SmartPLS version 3.0 software. It was obtained that techno-creators correlate positively and significantly with the technostress manifestations. A negative correlation was found between techno-inhibitors and technostress manifestations and techno-creators, but not significant for skepticism and inefficacy manifestations. Therefore, it is concluded that techno-creators lead to technostress manifestations, however, techno-inhibitors did not show a significant effect in reducing these manifestations in the sample studied.","Estrada-MuÃƒÂ±oz, Vega-MuÃƒÂ±oz, Boada-Grau, Castillo, MÃƒÂ¼ller-PÃƒÂ©rez, Contreras-Barraza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865784","20220617","education; information overload; information-technology; mental health; techno-creators; techno-inhibitors; technostress; work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33051,""
"Three Mental Health Symptoms of Frontline Medical Staff Associated With Occupational Stressors During the COVID-19 Peak Outbreak in China: The Mediation of Perceived Stress and the Moderation of Social Support","The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic has increased work demands for medical staff and has a certain impact on their mental health. The present study aimed to examine the role of perceived stress and social support in explaining the association between the occupational stressors and three mental health symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and insomnia) of frontline medical staff. Five hundred twenty five frontline medical staff were investigated online after the outbreak of the COVID-19 (16 February, 2020-2 March, 2020) in China. The results found that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among frontline medical staff were 39.8, 29.9, and 37.9%, respectively. Occupational stressors were associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. Perceived stress significantly mediated this link. Social support moderated the second half of the indirect effect of occupational stressors on anxiety and depression symptoms. Under the epidemic situation of COVID-19, for frontline medical staff, high perceived stress and low social support may increase vulnerability for mental health symptoms triggered by occupational stressors. Thus, improving the social support and promoting the cognitive reappraisal of perceived stress may help to maintain mental health among medical staff.","Zou, Lu, Zhou, Liu, Ngoubene-Atioky, Xu, Hong, Shen, Wu, Cai, Liu, Chen, Bao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.888000","20220617","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; frontline medical staff; insomnia; occupational stressors; perceived stress; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33052,""
"A Case of Internet Gaming Disorder: When #Play Apart Together Takes a Dark Turn","The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) places internet Gaming disorder (IGD) in its research appendix as a potential new behavioral addiction diagnosis that requires further investigation. As part of the media campaign #HealthyAtHome, recommendation to relieve stress and anxiety during COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocated for the playing of video games. The encouragement and expansion of playing video games may have led to the unintentional consequence of increasing the prevalence of IGD as IGD has been postulated to be a maladaptive response to stress. A 34 year old male presented to his primary care physician with decline in work function, increased depression, and anxiety. Before the COVID-19 pandemic he estimated that he spent 2 h a day playing games and socialized with friends weekly; however at the time of presentation, his social interactions were through online gaming only and he was playing games 14 h per day. The patient began paroxetine and bupropion, with good result, though declined concomitant psychotherapy. Internet Gaming Disorder is a potential new behavioral addiction that is likely to increase in prevalence over the continuing course of the COVID-19 pandemic. While initial studies show promising effects of medication and psychosocial interventions, further study on standardized diagnostic criteria and effectiveness of treatment modalities is needed.","O'Loughlin, Pelletier, Loomis, Alweis","https://doi.org/10.55729/2000-9666.1005","20220617","Addiction; Internet gaming","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33053,""
"Validation of the Peruvian Spanish Version of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Scale to Measure Viral Anxiety of Medical Students During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has created academic problems for Peruvian medical students leading to anxiety and depression. Hence, validated scales, such as the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6), are required to identify and propose interventions to improve mental health. We aimed to perform a psychometric validation of the Peruvian version of SAVE-6 on medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lima, Peru, in 2022. A total of 260 medical students at National University of San Marcos (UNMSM) participated in an online survey in January 2022. We collected sociodemographic characteristics and classified psychiatric symptoms using SAVE-6, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9). We performed confirmatory and parallel factor analysis to examine the validity of the Peruvian Spanish version of SAVE-6. We explored the reliability and validity of SAVE-6 and SAVE-6 after excluding item 5, since factor loading of item 5 is too low. Both scales showed good internal consistencies (Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± = 0.780 and.82 and McDonald's ÃŽÂ© = 0.792 and.829, respectively). Furthermore, SAVE-6 after excluding item 5 showed good convergent validity with GAD-7 (<i>r</i> = 0.224, <i>p</i> &lt;.001) and PHQ-9 (<i>r</i> = 0.217, <i>p</i> &lt;.001). Consequently, instead of the full SAVE-6, SAVE-6 excluding item 5 proved to be reliable and valid enough to assess the anxiety of Peruvian medical students during the pandemic. The Peruvian Spanish SAVE-6 scale excluding item 5, rather than the full SAVE-6, can be applied to measure viral anxiety of medical students in Peru with good validity and reliability.","Lapeyre-Rivera, Javier-Murillo, Perea-FlÃƒÂ³rez, Gamonal, VelÃƒÂ¡squez-Rimachi, Alva-DÃƒÂ­az, Ahmed, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.876379","20220617","COVID-19; Peru; SAVE-6; anxiety; medical students; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33054,""

"Mental Health and Related Factors Among Undergraduate Students During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Mental health problems among undergraduates are a significant public health concern. Most studies exploring mental health in this population during the pandemic have been conducted in high-income countries. Fewer studies come from Latin American countries. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, and suicide risk, and explore the association with several relevant variables in personal, family, university, and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic domains. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Chile in a medium-size private University. Outcome variables were explored with valid instruments: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Independent variables from personal (e.g., sex, age, sexual orientation, history of mental health problems, substance use), family (e.g., parental educational background, family history of mental health problems, family functioning), university (e.g., course year, financial support, psychological sense of university belonging, history of failing subjects) and SARS-CoV-2 domains (e.g., history of personal and family contagion, fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, frequency of physical activity, keeping routines and social contact). Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted for each outcome, after univariable and domain-specific multivariable models. The significant variable at each step was selected if the <i>p</i>-value was Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05. A total of 5,037 students answered the survey-the global response rate of 63.5%. Most of the students were females (70.4%) and freshmen students (25.2%). The prevalence of mental health problems was high: depression (37.1%), anxiety (37.9%), and stress (54.6%). Insomnia was reported in 32.5% of students, and suicide risk in 20.4% of students. The associated variables at personal domain were history of mental health problems, substance use, and sexual orientation; at family domain, family functioning and family history of mental health problems; at university domain, violence victimization and sense of belonging; and in SARS-CoV-2 domain, having a daily routine and fear to contracting SARS-CoV-2 by students themselves or others.

"Predicting Anxiety and Depression Among Patients With COVID-19 in Concentrated Isolation at Medical Camps in Vietnam: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study","This study aims to assess the requirement for anxiety and depression treatment for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in medical camps in Bac Giang province, Vietnam. This information can help improve the government policy to reduce anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. A total of patients with 427 COVID-19 participated in the survey conducted from 5 to 15 June 2021 in Bac Giang province. The survey included 17 questions about the general characteristics of the patients, 15 questions to assess common COVID-19 symptoms, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores, and four questions to assess hospital reviews, including facilities, food, medical staff, and living conditions. Logistics regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between COVID-19 symptoms and high anxiety and depression (HAD) status. A logistic regression analysis evaluated the risk factors in need of intervention. Our study showed that lower hospital review scores (odd ratio = 0.98; 95% confident interval = 0.97-0.99) were found to be a risk needing intervention. It was also identified that older patients (odd ratio = 1.1; 95% confident interval = 1.03-1.18), women (odd ratio = 1.31; 95% confident interval = 1.09-1.31), patients who were primary income earners in the family (odd ratio = 1.15; 95% confident interval = 1.03-1.28), patients who had headaches (odd ratio = 1.16; 95% confident interval = 1.06-1.21), and patients who had joint pain (odd ratio = 1.17; 95% confident interval = 1.06- 1.3) were risk factors for HAD status. Our research shows that every 10-year age increase was associated with a 10% increase in the likelihood of HAD status. Study subjects being primary income earners were also associated with a 15% increased risk of having HAD status.

"Impact of mandatory COVID-19 shelter-in-place order on controlled substance use among rural versus urban communities in the United States","Mandatory COVID-19 shelter-in-place (SIP) orders have been imposed to fight the pandemic. They may also have led to unintended consequences of increased use of controlled substances especially among rural communities due to increased social isolation. Using the data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers, this study tests the hypothesis that the poison control centers received higher rates of calls related to exposures to controlled substances from rural counties than they did from urban counties during the SIP period. Call counts received by the poison control centers between October 19, 2019 and July 6, 2020 due to exposure to controlled substance (methamphetamine, opioids, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and other narcotics) were aggregated to per-county-per-month-per-10,000 population exposure rates. A falsification test was conducted to reduce the possibility of spurious correlations. During the study period, 2,649 counties in the United States had mandatory SIP orders. The rate of calls reporting exposure to any of the aforementioned controlled substances among the rural counties was higher (14%; P = .047) relative to the urban counties. This overall increase was due to increases in the rates of calls reporting exposure to opioids (26%; P = .017) and methamphetamine (39%; P = .077). Moreover, the rate of calls reporting exposures at home was also higher among the rural counties (14%; P = .069). The mandatory SIP orders may have had an unintended consequence of exacerbating the use of controlled substances at home in rural communities relative to urban communities.","Maeng, Li, Lawrence, Keane, Cross, Conner, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12688","20220617","drug abuse; health law; mental health; observational data; policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33058,""

Significant differences were found in burnout and stress by class year (P = 0.002 and P &lt; 0.001) and race (P = 0.004 and P &lt; 0.001), with the highest levels in second- and third-year students and Black, Asian, or other racial minority students. Students experiencing financial strain or racism had higher burnout and stress (P &lt; 0.001 for all). Respondents with COVID-19 diagnoses in themselves or family members had higher stress (P &lt; 0.001). Nearly half (1756/3569) volunteered during the pandemic, with volunteers reporting lower burnout [48% (782/1639) vs. 52% (853/1656), P = 0.03]. While stress was higher compared to pre-pandemic data, burnout was significantly lower. Higher burnout and stress among Black, Asian, and other racial minority students and those who experienced financial strain, racism, or COVID-19 diagnoses likely reflect underlying racial and socioeconomic inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic and concurrent national racial injustice events. Volunteer engagement may be protective against burnout. Schools should proactively support vulnerable students during periods of stress.","Alkureishi, Jaishankar, Dave, Tatineni, Zhu, Chretien, Woodruff, Pincavage, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07497-2","20220617","COVID-19 pandemic; burnout; medical student well-being; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33059,""
"Expert Consensus on Measures to Promote Physical and Psychological Health among COVID-19-Related Healthcare Workers in Korea using Delphi Technique","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused health problems and distress among healthcare workers (HCWs), so supportive measures to promote their health and relieve distress are needed. We conducted two rounds of Delphi surveys with 20 COVID-19-related frontline healthcare professionals and public officials. The surveys evaluated means of supporting HCWs' health by improving health care systems and working environments in terms of effectiveness and urgency. The validity of the measures was assessed by calculating the content validity ratio. The top-priority measures to support HCWs were ""secure isolation units capable of treating severe cases"" in the facility infrastructure category, ""secure nursing staff dedicated for patients in the intensive care units"" in the personnel infrastructure category, ""improve communication between central office and frontline field"" in the cooperation system category, ""support personal protective equipment and infection control supplies"" in the aid supplies category, and ""realization of hazard pay"" in the physical/mental health and compensation category. There was consensus among the experts on the validity and priorities of policies in the facility, personnel, cooperation, supplies, and compensation categories regarding measures to promote COVID-19 related HCWs' health.","Lee, Noh, Kim, Ryoo, Park, Park, Lee, Cheong, Heo, Hong, Kim, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2021.0137","20220615","COVID-19; Delphi technique; Health personnel; Policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33060,""
"Professional perspectives on impacts, benefits and disadvantages of changes made to community continence services during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the EPICCC-19 national survey","The COVID-19 pandemic required changes to the organisation and delivery of NHS community continence services which assess and treat adults and children experiencing bladder and bowel difficulties. Although strong evidence exists for the physical and mental health benefits, improved quality of life, and health service efficiencies resulting from optimally organised community-based continence services, recent audits identified pre-pandemic pressures on these services. The aim of this study was to explore professional perceptions of changes made to community continence services due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent impacts on practice, care provision and patient experience. Online survey of 65 community continence services in England. Thematic analysis using constant comparison of open-ended questions. Frequency counts of closed-ended questions. Sixty-five services across 34 Sustainability and Transformation Partnership areas responded to the survey. Use of remote/virtual consultations enabled continuation of continence care but aspects of 'usual' assessment (examinations, tests) could not be completed within a remote assessment, requiring professionals to decide which patients needed subsequent in-person appointments. Remote appointments could increase service capacity due to their time efficiency, were favoured by some patients for their convenience, and could increase access to care for others. However, the limited ability to complete aspects of usual assessment raised concerns that diagnoses could be missed, or inappropriate care initiated. The format also restricted opportunities to identify non-verbal cues that could inform professional interpretation; and made building a therapeutic relationship between professional and patient more challenging. Remote appointments also posed access challenges for some patient groups. A third of participating services had experienced staff redeployment, resulting in long wait times and some patients being left without care; or reported additional caseload, which had delayed care provision for patients with continence issues. Participants perceived continence care to have been deprioritised, and more generally undervalued, and called for greater recognition of the impact of continence care. Remote appointments offer efficiency and convenience. However, 'in-person' approaches are highly valued for optimum quality, patient-centred continence care, and good team relationships. Failure to restore redeployed continence staff will diminish patient health and quality of life, with associated costs to the NHS.","Palmer, Richardson, Rayner, Drake, Cotterill","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08163-3","20220617","Access to care; COVID-19; Community continence services; Digital health; Impact; Incontinence; Qualitative; Redeployment; Remote appointments; Remote consultations; Adult; COVID-19; Child; Humans; Pandemics; Patient-Centered Care; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33061,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department visits for genitourinary trauma","The mean number of emergency department visits for all-cause traumas has declined significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to identify how a global pandemic and social distancing could affect the trends and pattern of genitourinary traumas. We queried the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to obtain consumer product-related genitourinary injuries leading to emergency department visits. Using three key events in 2020, we divided the study period to three intervals: January 20, when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States; March 13, when a national state of emergency was declared; April 20, when Texas became the first state to start a phased reopening of economy. We compared the injury characteristics in 2020 to their identical intervals in 2019. Daily emergency department visits dropped significantly during the national lockdown (mean 131.5 vs. 78; ÃŽâ€-40.7%; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The genitourinary injuries decreased significantly in childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°17Ã‚Â years (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), males (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and White population (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). However, it did not change significantly in adults 18-64Ã‚Â years (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.92), old adultsÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°65Ã‚Â years (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.37), females (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.60), Black population (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.90), other/unknown races (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.93), and for injuries sustained at home (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75) and public (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.11) locations.

"COVID-19 and mental health in Australia - a scoping review","The COVID-19 outbreak has spread to almost every country around the world and caused more than 3 million deaths. The pandemic has triggered enormous disruption in people's daily lives with profound impacts globally. This has also been the case in Australia, despite the country's comparative low mortality and physical morbidity due to the virus. This scoping review aims to provide a broad summary of the research activity focused on mental health during the first 10Ã‚Â months of the pandemic in Australia. A search of the Australian literature was conducted between August-November 2020 to capture published scientific papers, online reports and pre-prints, as well as gaps in research activities. The search identified 228 unique records in total. Twelve general population and 30 subpopulation group studies were included in the review. Few studies were able to confidently report changes in mental health driven by the COVID-19 context (at the population or sub-group level) due to a lack of pre-COVID comparative data and non-representative sampling. Never-the-less, in aggregate, the findings show an increase in poor mental health over the early period of 2020. Results suggest that young people, those with pre-existing mental health conditions, and the financially disadvantaged, experienced greater declines in mental health. The need for rapid research appears to have left some groups under-researched (e.g. Culturally and Linguistically Diverse populations and Indigenous peoples were not studied), and some research methods under-employed (e.g. there was a lack of qualitative and mixed-methods studies). There is a need for further reviews as the follow-up results of longitudinal studies emerge and understandings of the impact of the pandemic are refined.","Zhao, Leach, Walsh, Batterham, Calear, Phillips, Olsen, Doan, LaBond, Banwell","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13527-9","20220617","Australia; COVID-19; Mental health; Systematic review; Adolescent; Australia; COVID-19; Humans; Indigenous Peoples; Mental Health; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33063,""
"Impact of mobile phones and wireless devices use on children and adolescents' mental health: a systematic review","Growing use of mobiles phones (MP) and other wireless devices (WD) has raised concerns about their possible effects on children and adolescents' wellbeing. Understanding whether these technologies affect children and adolescents' mental health in positive or detrimental ways has become more urgent following further increase in use since the COVID-19 outbreak. To review the empirical evidence on associations between use of MP/WD and mental health in children and adolescents. A systematic review of literature was carried out on Medline, Embase and PsycINFO for studies published prior to July 15th 2019, PROSPERO ID: CRD42019146750. 25 observational studies published between January 1st 2011 and 2019 were reviewed (ten were cohort studies, 15 were cross-sectional). Overall estimated participant mean age and proportion female were 14.6Ã‚Â years and 47%, respectively. Substantial between-study heterogeneity in design and measurement of MP/WD usage and mental health outcomes limited our ability to infer general conclusions. Observed effects differed depending on time and type of MP/WD usage. We found suggestive but limited evidence that greater use of MP/WD may be associated with poorer mental health in children and adolescents. Risk of bias was rated as 'high' for 16 studies, 'moderate' for five studies and 'low' for four studies. More high-quality longitudinal studies and mechanistic research are needed to clarify the role of sleep and of type of MP/WD use (e.g. social media) on mental health trajectories in children and adolescents.","Girela-Serrano, Spiers, Ruotong, Gangadia, Toledano, Di Simplicio","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02012-8","20220615","Child and adolescent; Epidemiology; Mental health; Mobile phone and wireless devices; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33064,""
"Repairing moral injury takes a team: what clinicians can learn from combat veterans","Moral injury results from the violation of deeply held moral commitments leading to emotional and existential distress. The phenomenon was initially described by psychologists and psychiatrists associated with the US Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs but has since been applied more broadly. Although its application to healthcare preceded COVID-19, healthcare professionals have taken greater interest in moral injury since the pandemic's advent. They have much to learn from combat veterans, who have substantial experience in identifying and addressing moral injury-particularly its social dimensions. Veterans recognise that complex social factors lead to moral injury, and therefore a community approach is necessary for healing. We argue that similar attention must be given in healthcare, where a team-oriented and multidimensional approach is essential both for ameliorating the suffering faced by health professionals and for addressing the underlying causes that give rise to moral injury.","Cahill, Kinghorn, Dugdale","https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2022-108163","20220615","COVID-19; ethics- medical; health workforce; mental health; morals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33065,""
"Burden and factors associated with perceived stress amidst COVID-19: a population web-based study in Pakistan","This study aims to determine the burden and factors associated with perceived stress in the Pakistani population amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from April to August 2020. This survey was broadcasted on the web using a Google form link and 1654 Pakistani residents had completed this survey. Individuals belonging to any province, city, village, or district of Pakistan irrespective of any age, having internet access and a link of Google form, with English/Urdu competency, consent to participate, and currently residing in Pakistan were eligible to participate. Perceived stress was measured using a validated tool of perceived stress scale-10. Multiple ordinal regression was used, and an adjusted OR along with a 95% CI are reported. The mean score of perceived stress was 19.32 (SD Ã‚Â±6.67). Most of the participants screened positive for moderate (69%) and high levels (14%) of stress, respectively. The odds of high-perceived stress among severely anxious participants were 44.67 (95% CI: 21.33 to 93.53) times than participants with no/minimal generalised anxiety during the complete lockdown. However, the odds of high levels of perceived stress among moderately anxious respondents were 15.79 (95% CI: 10.19 to 24.28) times compared with participants with no/minimal anxiety during the smart lockdown. This study evidence that the pandemic was highly distressing for the Pakistani population causing the maximum level of perceived stress in more than half of the population.

"Predicting nursing students' psychological well-being: network analysis based on a model of thriving through relationships","Psychological well-being plays a vital role in nursing students' mental health and affects their decisions to stay in the nursing profession, particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak. Close relationships are undeniably linked to psychological well-being, but it is unknown how the specific pathways through which close relationships are related to each other and which are most strongly linked to nursing students' psychological well-being. To explore the network structure, central and bridge factors among well-being characteristics, and predictors based on a model of thriving through relationships. A cross-sectional research design was used with a sample of undergraduate nursing students (531 participants from the Southwest part of China). We used a network model to analyze the network structure of perceived social support, mindfulness, self-integrity, self-compassion, professional self-concept, savoring, intentional self-regulation, non-relational self-expansion, relational self-expansion, attachment insecurity, and psychological well-being. Ã‚Â A highly interconnected network of psychological well-being featured predictors and traits were formed. Node 8 (self-kindness), node 9 (self-judgment), and node 23 (non-relational self-expansion) were the predictors with the highest centrality in the network. Perceived social support and professional self-concept were most central in linking predictors to psychological well-being traits. Attachment insecurity was a non-supportive factor for predicting psychological well-being among female nursing students. Interventions based on these supportive/non-supportive predictors, which operate on different psychological levels, hold promise to achieve positive effects on psychological well-being among nursing students.","Zhou, Sukpasjaroen, Wu, Wang, Chankoson, Cai","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03517-1","20220620","Network analysis; Nursing students; Psychological well-being; Relationships; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Humans; Stress, Psychological; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33067,""
"Pregnant at the start of the pandemic: a content analysis of COVID-19-related posts on online pregnancy discussion boards","A growing body of evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental mental health effects for pregnant women. However, little is known about the specific stressors that increased anxiety for pregnant women at the start of the pandemic. The present study aimed to better understand the concerns of pregnant women during the beginning COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing content posted during the month of March 2020 on online pregnancy message boards hosted on WhatToExpect.com. All posts published between March 1-31, 2020 on nine different due-date specific WhatToExpect.com message boards were reviewed for COVID-19 relevance. Posts mentioning COVID-19 or its direct effects (e.g., ""quarantine"" or ""stay-at-home order"") were included in our final sample. Data were coded by three authors according to a codebook developed inductively by all four authors. Posts were analyzed by overall frequency of appearance, by trimester, and temporally across the month of March 2020. Across the 5,541 posts included in our final sample, the most common topics were fear of COVID-19 exposure, concerns with labor and delivery, navigating social interactions, and disruptions to prenatal care. The most dominant topics by trimester were disruptions to prenatal care (first trimester), fear of COVID-19 exposure (second trimester), and concerns about labor and delivery (third trimester). Our findings add to prior literature by demonstrating the salience of social concerns, which was the third largest COVID-19 topic in our sample. Emotional distress was most salient with regard to restrictions on birthing partners, but was apparent in everything from disruptions to pregnancy announcements, to cancelled baby showers, and limitations on newborn visitors. Given that anxiety during pregnancy is associated with worse maternal-fetal health outcomes, in the early stages of future pandemics healthcare providers should focus not only on strictly health-related concerns expressed by pregnant women, but alsoÃ‚Â more broadly on other sources of anxiety that may be impacting the well-being and mental health of their patients.","Choi, Nagappan, Kopyto, Wexler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04802-z","20220620","Anxiety; COVID-19; Digital health; Online discussion forums; Online forums; Pandemic; Pregnancy; Public health; Qualitative research; SARS-CoV-2; Anxiety; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pandemics; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33068,""
"A pragmatic effectiveness-implementation study comparing trial evidence with routinely collected outcome data for patients receiving the REACH-HF home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme","Cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure continues to be greatly underused worldwide despite being a Class I recommendation in international clinical guidelines and uptake is low in women and patients with mental health comorbidities. Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) programme was implemented in four UK National Health Service early adopter sites ('Beacon Sites') between June 2019 and June 2020. Implementation and patient-reported outcome data were collected across sites as part of the National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation. The change in key outcomes before and after the supervised period of REACH-HF intervention across the Beacon Sites was assessed and compared to those of the intervention arm of the REACH-HF multicentre trial. Compared to the REACH-HF multicentre trial, patients treated at the Beacon Site were more likely to be female (33.8% vs 22.9%), older (75.6 vs 70.1), had a more severe classification of heart failure (26.5% vs 17.7%), had poorer baseline health-related quality of life (MLHFQ score 36.1 vs 31.4), were more depressed (HADS score 6.4 vs 4.1) and anxious (HADS score 7.2 vs 4.7), and had lower exercise capacity (ISWT distance 190Ã‚Â m vs 274.7Ã‚Â m). There appeared to be a substantial heterogeneity in the implementation process across the four Beacon Sites as evidenced by the variation in levels of patient recruitment, operationalisation of the REACH-HF intervention and patient outcomes. Overall lower improvements in patient-reported outcomes at the Beacon Sites compared to the trial may reflect differences in the population studied (having higher morbidity at baseline) as well as the marked challenges in intervention delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study illustrate the challenges in consistently implementing an intervention (shown to be clinically effective and cost-effective in a multicentre trial) into real-world practice, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. Further research is needed to establish the real-world effectiveness of the REACH-HF intervention in different populations.","Daw, Harrison, Doherty, van Zanten, Dalal, Taylor, van Beurden, McDonagh, Greaves","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-022-02707-5","20220620","Cardiac rehabilitation; Heart failure; Quality of life; Quantitative evaluation; Routinely collected health data; Treatment outcome; COVID-19; Cardiac Rehabilitation; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Quality of Life; State Medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33069,""

Discharged patients aged 18 years or more (n=4665), hospitalised between 28 February and 11 May 2020, whether they had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 or not, were asked to complete a self-reporting questionnaire, as were their informal caregivers, if available (n=866). Participants answered questions from Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (0=no stress, 40=severe stress), Krajewska-KuÃ…â€šak <i>et al</i>'s Trust in Nurses Scale and Anderson and Dedrick's Trust in Physician Scale (10=no trust, 50=complete trust), the severity of a SARS-CoV-2 infection (1=not serious, 5=very serious), as well as questions on their perceived feelings of safety (0=not safe, 10=extremely safe). Of our 1341 respondents, 141 had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Median PSS score was 24 (IQR1-3=19-29), median trust in healthcare staff was 33 (IQR1-3=31-36), median perceived severity of a SARS-CoV-2 infection was 4 (IQR1-3=3-4) and the median feelings of safety score was 8 (IQR1-3=8-10). Significant differences were found between males and females for PSS scores (p&lt;0.001) and trust scores (p&lt;0.001). No significant differences were found between males and females for the perceived severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection scores (p=0.552) and the feelings of safety (p=0.751). Associations were found between age and trust scores (Rs=0.201), age and perceived SARS-CoV-2 severity scores (Rs=0.134), sex (female) and perceived stress (Rs=0.114), and sex (female) and trust scores (Rs=0.137).

"Undergraduate dental students' perspective of online learning and their physical and mental health during COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic continuously spread exacerbating global concerns. It had impacted all life aspects such as social, cultural, economic and education. This study assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate dental students at Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health of undergraduate dental students. This is a cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire was administrated to 150 undergraduate dental students. The questionnaire included questions related to students' demographic data, their concerns on academic achievement, their opinion on institution response, and the impact of the crisis on their mental and physical health. SPSS software v26.0 was used to analyse the collected data. A total of 147 respondents participated in the study. About 66% of the students felt comfortable in adapting to the new technology while 85.7% were concerned about the quality of online learning. Almost all students 98.6% expressed their doubts on the ability to pass the competency exams and to graduate on time, with only 49.7% agreed that clinical experience was effectively delivered through online classes.

"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of public university hospital workers in Brazil: A cohort-based analysis of 32,691 workers","In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic paralyzed the world and exposed the fragility of health systems in the face of mass illness. Health professionals became protagonists, fulfilling their mission at the risk of physical and mental illness. The study aimed to evaluate absenteeism indirectly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large population of health care professionals. An observational longitudinal repeated measures study was performed, including workers linked to 40 public university hospitals in Brazil. All causes of absenteeism were analyzed, focusing on those not directly attributed to COVID-19. Results for the same population were compared over two equivalent time intervals: prepandemic and during the pandemic. A total of 32,691 workers were included in the study, with health professionals comprising 82.5% of the sample. Comparison of the periods before and during the pandemic showed a 26.6% reduction in work absence for all causes, except for COVID-19 and mental health-related absence. Concerning work absence related to mental health, the odds ratio was 39.0% higher during the pandemic. At the onset of the pandemic, there was an increase in absenteeism (all causes), followed by a progressive reduction until the end of the observation period. Work absence related to mental illness among health care professionals increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for health care managers to prioritize and implement support strategies to minimize absenteeism.","Barros-Areal, Albuquerque, Silva, Pinho, Oliveira, da Silva, Gomes, de Oliveira, Kurizky, Reis, Talma Ferreira, de Amorim, Lima, Besch, Gatto, Costa, da Silva, Schulte, Espindola, da Mota","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269318","20220620","Brazil; COVID-19; Health Personnel; Hospitals, University; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33072,""
"Utility of Diagnostic Classification for Children 0-5 to Assess Features of Autism: Comparing In-person and COVID-19 Telehealth Evaluations","Logistic regression was used to examine the use of Autism Spectrum diagnostic categories from pre-COVID-19 in-person evaluations and COVID-19 telehealth evaluations at a specialist community mental health clinic. The diagnostic classification for children 0-5 (DC: 0-5) affords a wider range of diagnoses that allowed for inferences of clinician certainty of diagnosis. Use of full criteria diagnoses was significantly lower from telehealth evaluations during the pandemic, and was less certain for younger children, some non-English speakers, and children reporting Native American/Alaska Native race. Higher Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ASD subscale scores, lower CBCL total scores, and global developmental delay diagnoses predicted greater use of full ASD diagnoses. Findings suggest factors that could identify children appropriate for telehealth evaluations.","Holtman, Winans, Hoch","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-022-05606-y","20220616","Autism spectrum disorder; COVID-19; DC: 0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5; Diagnostic decision making; Logistic regression; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33073,""
"Assessment of Sleep Features, Mental Health Outcomes, and Alcohol and Tobacco Consumption in Residents and Fellows in Otolaryngology Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The workload of many residents and fellows in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery has particularly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, outcomes associated with mental health status and sleep remain unclear. To assess the sleep, mental status, and alcohol and tobacco consumption habits of residents and fellows before the COVID-19 pandemic (before March 10, 2020) and during the pandemic period (after March 10, 2020). This cohort study included residents and fellows of 6 university hospitals of European regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Survey development, data collection, and analyses were performed from March 10, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Residents and fellows were invited to respond to a survey assessing management of treatment in patients with COVID-19 and related work features; stress and mental health status (Beck Depression Inventory); sleep features (Insomnia Severity Index); and alcohol and tobacco consumption. Of 220 potential participants, 128 residents and fellows (58.2%) completed the evaluations. No demographic data on mean (SD) age and sex or gender were collected. The prepandemic mean (SD) score of the Beck Depression Inventory (3.1 [2.8]) significantly increased after the start of the pandemic (mean [SD] score, 4.2 [4.1]; difference, -1.1; 95% CI, -1.96 to -0.24; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31), and the prepandemic mean (SD) score of the Insomnia Severity Index (4.9 [4.1) significantly increased after the start of the pandemic (mean [SD] score, 6.0 [4.9]; difference, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.00-2.2; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25). Insomnia concerned 46% of participants (51 of 112), and depression concerned 47% of participants (55 of 116) during the pandemic. The mean (SD) prepandemic alcohol consumption (1.7 [2.3] IU per week) significantly increased after the start of the pandemic (mean [SD], 2.9 [4.0] IU per week; difference, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.40-2.00; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.37). Residents and fellows who were mobilized in COVID-19 units reported significant increases of workload (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.3), stress level (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.3), and alcohol consumption (for 5-10 IU per week: mean [SD] prepandemic, 11 [8] IU per week vs postpandemic, 20 [16] IU per week; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.37) and a worsening of sleep status (for moderate insomnia: mean [SD] prepandemic Insomnia Severity Index, 4 [3] vs postpandemic, 15 [12]; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25). There was a significant association between alcohol consumption and the Beck Depression Inventory score (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6). The mean (SD) consumption of tobacco decreased from 2.1 (1.3) to 0.9 (1.5) (difference, -1.20; 95% CI, -1.50 to -0.85; dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85). Results of this cohort study suggest that the workload of residents and fellows increased during the pandemic, which may be associated with a worsening of mental health and sleep status and an increase of alcohol consumption.","Chebib, Chiesa-Estomba, Radulesco, Barillari, Mayo-YÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez, Hans, Lechien","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2022.1210","20220616","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33074,""
"Novel genes and sex differences in COVID-19 severity","Here we describe the results of a genome-wide study conducted in 11Ã¢â‚¬â€°939 COVID-19 positive cases with an extensive clinical information that were recruited from 34 hospitals across Spain (SCOURGE consortium). In sex-disaggregated genome-wide association studies for COVID-19 hospitalization, genome-wide significance (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°5x10-8) was crossed for variants in 3p21.31 and 21q22.11 loci only among males (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 1.3x10-22 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 8.1x10-12, respectively), and for variants in 9q21.32 near TLE1 only among females (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 4.4x10-8). In a second phase, results were combined with an independent Spanish cohort (1598 COVID-19 cases and 1068 population controls), revealing in the overall analysis two novel risk loci in 9p13.3 and 19q13.12, with fine-mapping prioritized variants functionally associated with AQP3 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 2.7x10-8) and ARHGAP33 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 1.3x10-8), respectively. The meta-analysis of both phases with four European studies stratified by sex from the Host Genetics Initiative confirmed the association of the 3p21.31 and 21q22.11 loci predominantly in males and replicated a recently reported variant in 11p13 (ELF5, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.1x10-8). Six of the COVID-19 HGI discovered loci were replicated and an HGI-based genetic risk score predicted the severity strata in SCOURGE. We also found more SNP-heritability and larger heritability differences by age (&lt;60 orÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã‚Â years) among males than among females. Parallel genome-wide screening of inbreeding depression in SCOURGE also showed an effect of homozygosity in COVID-19 hospitalization and severity and this effect was stronger among older males. In summary, new candidate genes for COVID-19 severity and evidence supporting genetic disparities among sexes are provided.","Cruz, Almeida, Heredia, Quintela, Ceballos, Pita, Lorenzo-Salazar, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Montelongo, Gago-DomÃƒÂ­nguez, Porras, CastaÃƒÂ±o, Nevado, Aguado, Aguilar, Aguilera-Albesa, Almadana, Almoguera, Alvarez, Andreu-Bernabeu, Arana-Arri, Arango, Arranz, Artiga, Baptista-Rosas, Barreda-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Belhassen-Garcia, Bezerra, Bezerra, Boix-Palop, Brion, Brugada, Bustos, CalderÃƒÂ³n, Carbonell, Castano, Castelao, Conde-Vicente, Cordero-Lorenzana, Cortes-Sanchez, Corton, Darnaude, De Martino-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Campo-PÃƒÂ©rez, Bustamante, DomÃƒÂ­nguez-Garrido, Luchessi, EirÃƒÂ³s, Sanabria, FariÃƒÂ±as, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Robelo, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Villa, Gil-Fournier, GÃƒÂ³mez-Arrue, ÃƒÂlvarez, QuirÃƒÂ³s, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-PeÃƒÂ±as, GutiÃƒÂ©rrez-Bautista, Herrero, Herrero-Gonzalez, Jimenez-Sousa, Lattig, Borja, Lopez-Rodriguez, Mancebo, MartÃƒÂ­n-LÃƒÂ³pez, MartÃƒÂ­n, Martinez-Nieto, Martinez-Lopez, Martinez-Resendez, Martinez-Perez, Mazzeu, MacÃƒÂ­as, Minguez, Cuerda, Silbiger, Oliveira, Ortega-Paino, Parellada, Paz-Artal, Santos, PÃƒÂ©rez-Matute, Perez, PÃƒÂ©rez-TomÃƒÂ¡s, Perucho, Pinsach-Abuin, Pompa-Mera, Porras-Hurtado, Pujol, LeÃƒÂ³n, Resino, Fernandes, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Ruiz, Rodriguez-Artalejo, Rodriguez-Garcia, Ruiz-Cabello, Ruiz-Hornillos, Ryan, Soria, Souto, Tamayo, Tamayo-Velasco, Taracido-Fernandez, Teper, Torres-Tobar, Urioste, Valencia-Ramos, YÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez, Zarate, Nakanishi, Pigazzini, Degenhardt, Butler-Laporte, Maya-Miles, Bujanda, Bouysran, Palom, Ellinghaus, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Bueno, Rolker, Amitrano, Roade, Fava, Spinner, Prati, Bernardo, Garcia, Darcis, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Cadenas, Holter, Banales, Frithiof, Duga, Asselta, Pereira, Romero-GÃƒÂ³mez, NafrÃƒÂ­a-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Hov, Migeotte, Renieri, Planas, Ludwig, Buti, Rahmouni, AlarcÃƒÂ³n-Riquelme, Schulte, Franke, Karlsen, Valenti, Zeberg, Richards, Ganna, Boada, Rojas, Ruiz, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Real, Guillen-Navarro, Ayuso, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Neira, Riancho, Rojas-Martinez, Flores, Lapunzina, Carracedo","https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddac132","20220616","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33075,""
"Increased rates of suicide ideation and attempts in rural dwellers following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Those factors identified to increase the risk of suicide in rural dwellers were exacerbated by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, specifically economic factors, substance use, access to health care, and access to lethal weapons. Because the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on suicide ideation and attempts in rural populations have not been fully characterized in published literature, this study compares: (1) the rates of suicide ideation and attempts between the 6 months affected by SARS-CoV-2 to same months of the preceding year (3/18/2020-9/18/20; 3/18/2019-9/18/19), (2) demographics (ie, age, sex, residence, race, and ethnicity), and (3) the locations in which the encounters were billed (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department). Deidentified claims data associated with patient encounters billed for Suicide Ideation and Suicide Attempt were grouped based on time period and analyzed using descriptive statistics, incidence rate ratio (IRR), 2-sample t-test, chi-square test of association, or Fisher's exact test. Suicidal ideation encounters increased in the 6 months post-SARS-CoV-2 when compared to the 6 months of the prior year (IRR = 1.19; P &lt; .001). Males (IRR = 1.27, P &lt; .001), those residing rural areas (IRR = 1.22, P = .01), and Black, non-Hispanic (IRR = 1.24, P = .024) were found to have increased rates of suicide ideation post-SARS-Cov-2. In adults, White, non-Hispanics (IRR = 1.16; P &lt; .001) had increased rates of post-SARS-CoV-2. In the pediatric subset, those who were aged 14-17 (IRR = 1.50; P &lt; .001), resided in rural areas (IRR = 1.61, P = .009), and idenitifed as Hispanic (IRRÃ‚Â = 1.89; P = .037) or Black, non-Hispanic (IRR = 1.61, P = .009) had increased rates post-SARS-CoV-2.

"Evaluation of distance learning and online exam experience of Turkish undergraduate dental students during the Covid-19 pandemic","Although distance education has been received as an effective educational method in dentistry, the assessment of distance learning and online-exam methods in instantaneous conditions such as a pandemic has not been completely researched. The purpose of the present study was to assess student satisfaction with the distance learning and online-exam experience of dental students in Turkey during the pandemic. Dental students in selected Turkish universities were invited to participate in the research. As a data collection tool, socio-demographic data and a web-based questionnaire consisting of 23 questions, addressing the problems experienced in education during the Covid-19 pandemic period and questioning the solutions of students regarding these problems were used. Satisfaction and attitudes towards distance education and online exams were examined. A total of 1375 students participated in the study. The percentages of students at the various grades of dental school were as follows: first grade = 11.2%, second grade = 18.2%, third grade = 28.3%, fourth grade = 27%, and fifth grade = 15.1%. There is a significant relationship between classes and all scale expressions (P &lt; 0.05). While 11.2% of the students who responded had not experienced any problems, the most common problem was that practical training could not be performed (45.8%) and the lessons were inefficient (29.7%). Dental students demonstrated a low degree of satisfaction and a negative attitude towards distance learning and the quality of presentation of educational material.","Cirakoglu, Ozbay","https://doi.org/10.4103/njcp.njcp_1949_21","20220620","Covid-19; dental education; distance education; online exam; COVID-19; Education, Distance; Humans; Pandemics; Students, Dental; Turkey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33077,""
"The impact of provincial lockdown policies and COVID-19 case and mortality rates on anxiety in Canada","COVID-19 has had significant mental health impacts internationally and anxiety rates are estimated to have tripled during the pandemic, but the specific causes remain underexplored. This study's purpose was to investigate the associations of sociodemographic factors, COVID-19-related policies, and COVID-19 case/mortality rates with levels of anxiety among Canadians during the pandemic. This study used linear regression models populated with three integrated sources of data: a repeated cross-sectional survey (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7,008), Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data, and COVID-19 case/mortality rates. Sociodemographic factors included were age, gender, race, province, income, education, rurality, household composition, and factors related to employment. Local COVID-19 case and mortality rates and stay-at-home orders were positively associated with anxiety symptom severity. Anxiety was most severe among those who: were female, Indigenous, or Middle Eastern; had postsecondary education; lived with others; and became unemployed or had working hours altered during the pandemic. Anxiety was less severe among: older adults; male, Caucasians, and black individuals; those with high incomes, and; those for whom employment did not change during the pandemic. Anxiety was primarily driven by socioeconomic factors among Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies that alleviate socioeconomic uncertainty for groups that are most vulnerable may reduce the long-term harm of the pandemic and associated lockdown policies.

This study aimed to evaluate whether Brazilian health care workers were satisfied with their workplace measures to protect their physical and mental health during the pandemic, and to assess the associations of such levels of satisfaction with indicators of burnout. Licensed Brazilian health care professionals were recruited <i>via</i> popular media between 5/19/2020 and 8/23/2020 to complete an online survey including questions about their demographic/professional characteristics, satisfaction with their workplace protective measures during the pandemic, and validated questionnaires assessing neuroticism, resilient coping, and symptoms of burnout. Most participants reported being dissatisfied with their workplace measures to protect their physical (516, 56.3%) and mental health (756, 82.5%). In multivariable analysis adjusted for personal and environmental factors, dissatisfaction with workplace physical health protections was significantly associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion (<i>B</i> = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.47-1.69) and depersonalization (<i>B</i> = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.10-1.12), and dissatisfaction with workplace mental health protections significantly associated with higher levels emotional exhaustion (<i>B</i> = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.40-1.95).

This study investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without new-onset neuro-PASC, and of flu patients with similar symptoms. We retrospectively screened 18,811 COVID-19 patients and 5772 flu patients between January 2020 and June 2021 for the presence of new-onset neuro-sequelae that persisted at least 2Ã‚Â weeks past the date of COVID-19 or flu diagnosis. We observed 388 COVID-19 patients with neuro-PASC versus 149 flu patients with neuro-sequelae. Common neuro-PASC symptoms were anxiety (30%), depression (27%), dizziness (22%), altered mental status (17%), chronic headaches (17%), and nausea (11%). The average time to neuro-PASC onset was 138Ã‚Â days, with hospitalized patients reporting earlier onset than non-hospitalized patients. Neuro-PASC was associated with female sex and older age (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05), but not race, ethnicity, most comorbidities, or COVID-19 disease severity (pÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Compared to flu patients, COVID-19 patients were older, exhibited higher incidence of altered mental status, developed symptoms more quickly, and were prescribed psychiatric drugs more often (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05).

We therefore explored positive psychological experiences and coping behaviours that protected mental health and well-being. Participants were 40 young people (aged 13-24) and 28 older adults (aged 70+) living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were held between May 2020 and January 2021. We generated six themes using qualitative thematic analysis, including: engagement in self-fulfilling activities, increased sense of social cohesion, personal growth, use of problem-focused strategies to manage pandemic-related stressors, giving and receiving social and community support, and utilising strategies to regulate thoughts and emotions. While all six themes were relevant both to younger and older adults, there were nuances in how each was experienced and enacted. For example, many older adults adjusted their routines given worries about virus vulnerability, while some young people experienced greater personal growth amidst increased awareness of mental health as they navigated the various lockdown restrictions.","Liyann Ooi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0068-1CB-768","20220621","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; well-being; young people; positive psychology; coping; resilience; older adults; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33082,""
"Who bought a gun during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States?: Associations with QAnon beliefs, right-wing political attitudes, intimate partner violence, antisocial behavior, suicidality, and mental health and substance use problems","There was a large spike in gun purchases and gun violence during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We used an online U.S. national survey (N = 1036) to examine the characteristics of people who purchased a gun between March 2020 and October 2021 (n = 103) and compared them to non-gun owners (n = 763) and people who own a gun but did not purchase a gun during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 170). Compared to non-gun owners, pandemic gun buyers were younger and more likely to be male, White race, and to affiliate with the Republican party. Compared to non-gun owners and pre-pandemic gun owners, pandemic gun buyers exhibited extreme elevations on a constellation of political (QAnon beliefs, pro-gun attitudes, Christian Nationalism, approval of former President Donald Trump, anti-vax beliefs, COVID-19 skepticism; mean d = 1.15), behavioral (intimate partner violence, antisocial behavior; mean d = 1.38), mental health (suicidality, depression, anxiety, substance use; mean d = 1.21), and personality (desire for power, belief in a dangerous world, low agreeableness, low conscientiousness; mean d = 0.95) characteristics. In contrast, pre-pandemic gun owners only endorsed more pro-gun attitudes (d = 0.67), lower approval of President Joe Biden (d = -0.41) and were more likely to be male and affiliate with the Republican party relative to non-gun owners. Pandemic gun buyers represent an extreme group in terms of political and psychological characteristics including several risk-factors for violence and self-harm.","Brian M.

"Disparities in COVID-19-related trauma and internalizing symptoms across sexual orientation and race/ethnicity during the pandemic: An intersectional approach","Background. Sexual minorities face elevated risk for internalizing problems due to minority stress, and these may have been particularly exacerbated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined sexual orientation and race/ethnicity-related mental health disparities during the first two months of stay-at-home orders. Method. We investigated disparities in COVID-19-related trauma and internalizing (i.e., depression, anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty) symptoms in a university community via surveys in March (Wave 1) and May 2020 (Wave 2) cross-sectionally using t-tests and longitudinally using residualized change score regressions. The analytic sample (N = 646; M age = 25.70, SD age = 10.16 at Wave 1) comprised 350 (54.2%) White, non-Hispanic and 296 (45.8%) racial/ethnic minority participants; and 514 (79.6%) heterosexual and 132 (20.4%) sexual minority participants. Results. Sexual minorities reported greater symptomatology than heterosexuals across all outcomes at each wave. Racial/ethnic minorities reported no outcome differences compared to White, non-Hispanic individuals at each wave. Sexual minorities, compared to heterosexual individuals, reported decreased recovery of COVID-19-related trauma and increased intolerance of uncertainty at Wave 2. Conclusions. These findings build upon a growing body of literature of mental health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight the importance of examining COVID-19-related trauma to understand the effects of the pandemic on minoritized populations, particularly sexual minorities. Further work is needed to elucidate the potential exacerbating effects of minority stress in these disparities.","Jenny Shen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00CE-556-F7D","20220620","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; internalizing; sexual minorities; racial/ethnic minorities; trauma; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","",33084,""
