"A Case-Crossover Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) for Understanding Post-COVID-19 Diagnosis Patterns","Importance: Post COVID-19 condition (PCC) is known to affect a large proportion of COVID-19 survivors. Robust study design and methods are needed to understand post-COVID-19 diagnosis patterns in all COVID-19 survivors, not just the ones clinically diagnosed with PCC. Objective: To assess which diagnoses appear more frequently after a COVID-19 infection and how they differ by COVID-19 severity and vaccination status. Design: We applied a case-crossover phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 survivors, comparing the occurrences of 1,649 diagnosis-based phenotype codes (PheCodes) pre- and post-COVID-19 infection periods in the same individual using a conditional logistic regression. Setting: Patients tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 through May 1, 2022. Participants: 36,856 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and 141,615 age- and sex-matched SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as a comparison group for sensitivity analysis. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 virus infection as determined by RT-PCR testing and/or clinical evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures: We compared the rate of occurrence of 1,649 disease classification codes in ""pre-"" and ""post-COVID-19 periods"". We studied how this pattern varied by COVID-19 severity and vaccination status at the time of infection. Results: Using a case-crossover PheWAS framework, we found mental, circulatory, and respiratory disorders to be strongly associated with the ""post-COVID-19 period"" for the overall COVID-19-positive cohort. A total of 325 PheCodes reached phenome-wide significance (p<3e-05), and top hits included cardiac dysrhythmias (OR=1.7 [95%CI: 1.6-1.9]), respiratory failure, insufficiency, arrest (OR=3.1 [95%CI: 2.7-3.5]) and anxiety disorder (OR=1.7 [95%CI: 1.6-1.8]). In the patients with severe disease, we found stronger associations with many respiratory and circulatory disorders, such as pneumonia (p=2.1e-18) and acute pulmonary heart disease (p=2.4e-8), and the ""post-COVID-19 period,"" compared to those with mild/moderate disease. Test negative patients exhibited a somewhat similar association pattern to those fully vaccinated, with mental health and chronic circulatory diseases rising to the top of the association list in these groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Our results confirm that patients experience myriad symptoms more than 28 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but especially mental, circulatory, and respiratory disorders. Our case-crossover PheWAS approach controls for within-person confounders that are time-invariant. Comparison to test negatives with a similar design helped identify enrichment specific to COVID-19. As we look into the future, we must be aware of COVID-19 survivors' healthcare needs in the period after infection.","Spencer R. Haupert; Xu Shi; Chen Chen; Lars G.

"At-home, sublingual ketamine telehealth is a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe anxiety and depression: Findings from a large, prospective, open-label effectiveness trial","At-home Ketamine-assisted therapy (KAT) with psychosocial support and remote monitoring through telehealth platforms addresses access barriers, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Large-scale evaluation of this approach is needed for questions regarding safety and effectiveness for depression and anxiety. In this prospective study, a large outpatient sample received KAT over four weeks through a telehealth provider. Symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) for anxiety. Demographics, adverse events, and patient-reported dissociation were also analyzed. Symptom trajectories were identified using Growth Mixture Modeling, along with outcome predictors. A sample of 1247 completed treatment with sufficient data, 62.8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% reported a 50Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% or greater improvement on the PHQ-9, dÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.61, and 62.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% on the GAD-7, dÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.56. Remission rates were 32.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% for PHQ-9 and 31.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% for GAD-7, with 0.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% deteriorating on the PHQ-9, and 0.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% on the GAD-7. Four patients left treatment early due to side effects or clinician disqualification, and two more due to adverse events. Three patient subpopulations emerged, characterized by Improvement (79.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), Chronic (11.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), and Delayed Improvement (9.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) for PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Endorsing side effects at Session 2 was associated with delayed symptom improvement, and Chronic patients were more likely than the other two groups to report dissociation at Session 4. At-home KAT response and remission rates indicated rapid and significant antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Rates were consistent with laboratory- and clinic-administered ketamine treatment. Patient screening and remote monitoring maintained low levels of adverse events. Future research should assess durability of effects.","Hull, Malgaroli, Gazzaley, Akiki, Madan, Vando, Arden, Swain, Klotz, Paleos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.07.004","20220709","Anxiety; Digital health; Ketamine-assisted therapy; Major depression; Psychedelic-assisted therapy; Real-world; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33968,""
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors in kidney transplant recipients: a multicentre, single-arm, phase 1 study","Most kidney transplant recipients with cancer stop or reduce immunosuppressive therapy before starting treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and approximately 40% of such patients will develop allograft rejection. Isolated immunosuppression reduction might be associated with organ rejection. Whether immunosuppression manipulation, immune checkpoint inhibition, or both, induce organ rejection is difficult to ascertain. The aim of this study was to examine the risk of allograft rejection with immune checkpoint inhibitor exposure when baseline immunosuppression was left unchanged. We conducted a multicentre, single-arm, phase 1 study in three hospitals in Australia. Kidney transplant recipients aged 18 years or older with incurable, locally advanced cancer or defined metastatic solid tumours were eligible if they had a creatinine concentration of less than 180 mmol/L, no or low concentrations of donor-specific HLA antibodies, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0-2. Patients received standard doses of nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days for five cycles, then 480 mg every 28 days for up to 2 years). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with irretrievable allograft rejection and no evidence of tumour response. Primary outcome analyses and safety analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, ANZCTR12617000741381, and is completed. Between May 31, 2017, and Aug 6, 2021, 22 kidney transplant recipients with various solid tumours were screened and enrolled, four of whom chose not to proceed in the study and one of whom had unexpected disease progression. 17 patients (six [35%] women and 11 [65%] men; median age 67 years [IQR 59-71]) were allocated treatment with nivolumab and were included in the analyses. The trial was then stopped due to ongoing difficulties with running clinical trials during COVID-19 health restrictions. Patients were treated with a median of three infusions (IQR 2-10) and median follow-up was 28 months (IQR 16-34). No patients had irretrievable allograft rejection without evidence of tumour response. There were no treatment-related deaths or treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events were decreased lymphocyte count in four (24%) patients, fever or infection in four (24%) patients, decreased haemoglobin in three (18%) patients, and increased creatinine in three (18%) patients. Maintaining baseline immunosuppression before treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in kidney transplant recipients might not affect expected efficacy and might reduce the risk of allograft rejection mediated by immune checkpoint inhibitors.

"COVID-19, adversities and depression among older adolescents in urban slums of India","We report findings from a survey on the mental health impact of COVID-19 factoring environmental adversities among older adolescents (15-19 years) living in urban slums in India. We report survey results of 3490 older adolescents. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression, slum adversity questionnaire for slum conditions, and for COVID-19 infection we recorded self-reported positivity status. Sociodemographic details were also collected. Additional sub-group analyses of sample who had depression and tested positive for COVID-19 infection was conducted. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify factors and COVID-19 infection that were associated with depression. Adolescents with adversities were three times more likely to report depression. Adolescents who reported COVID-19 infection were about two times more likely to have depression. Sub-group analyses showed that adolescents having experienced adversities and girls were more likely to report depression following COVID-19 infection. There is a need for an intersectional research framework that incorporates stress arising out of a pandemic, social disadvantage, and systemic inequities. Such a framework will help to assess mental health issues of developmentally vulnerable groups residing in disadvantageous conditions.","Daniel, Prashad, Kaur, Kallakuri, Devarapalli, Sagar, Maulik","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103194","20220709","COVID-19; Depression; India; Mental wellbeing; Older adolescents; Slum adversity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33970,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological health in a sample of Italian adults: A three-wave longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting societal restrictions have had negative implications for mental health in the general population. The aims of the present longitudinal study were (i) to investigate changes in psychopathological symptoms and psychological well-being in a sample of Italian individuals surveyed at different points of the pandemic and (ii) to evaluate the potential risk and protective factors associated with the psychopathological outcomes. Self-reported data on psychiatric symptoms, and psychological well-being were collected in March 2020 (T0, the lockdown phase), in May 2020 (T1, the end of the lockdown phase), and in November 2020 (T2, the second wave of COVID-19 infection). 1258 participants (M<sub>age</sub>=23.43, SD<sub>age</sub>=6.45; 75.4% female) were recruited at T0. Of these, 712 also completed the T1 survey, and 369 also completed the T2 survey. A significant decrease in anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and a significant increase in psychological well-being were observed from T0 to T1. All psychopathological symptoms increased, and psychological well-being decreased significantly from T1 to T2. Several demographic, psychological and COVID-19-related factors emerged as predictors over the course of the pandemic. The current findings indicated that psychological health covaried with the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated societal restrictions.","Fioravanti, Bocci Benucci, Prostamo, Banchi, Casale","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114705","20220709","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Longitudinal design; Obsessive-compulsive symptoms; Psychological well-being; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33971,""
"Biologicals decrease psychological distress, anxiety and depression in severe asthma, despite Covid-19 pandemic","Patients with respiratory diseases suffer more from problems of severe psychiatric comorbidity than the general population. Asthma might cause psychiatric disorders and affect patients' quality of life negatively. Previous studies reported that mental disorders prevail in asthmatic patients, causing anxiety, depression, and suicidal risk. The aim of this study is to evaluate in real life the prevalence of psychological comorbidities in asthmatics with severe asthma treated by biologicals (Benralizumab, Mepolizumab, Omalizumab). This study starts with the hypothesis that psychological distress, anxiety, depression and suicidal risk in severe asthma patients decreases if treated by biologicals. This study involves a sample of 90 patients (32 males, 58 females and aged 53.92Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 15.92) suffering from severe asthma and treated with the biological drugs of Benralizumab, Mepolizumab, Omalizumab during Covid-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the treatment (T0) and after 16 weeks (T1), there have been reported results from both clinical disease control, assessed using the ACT, and psychological disorders, assessed with the PSS, HADS and C-SSRS. In the sample of these patients treated with biologicals for severe asthma, the study reported a significant change in all observed parameters, including asthma control (ACT), stress (PSS), anxiety (HADS-A) and depressive symptoms (HADS-D, despite Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, there was a significant improvement in disease management, perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms after a 16 week treatment for severe asthma, independent from the type of biologic drugs used during the pandemic.","Patella, Pelaia, Zunno, Pelaia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2022.106916","20220709","Monoclonal antibodies; Psychological disorders; SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; Severe asthma; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33972,""

"Ambient and Wearable Sensor Technologies for Energy Expenditure Quantification of Ageing Adults","COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways, with dramatic changes in mental health, sleep time and level of physical activity. These changes have been especially relevant in the elderly population, with important health-related consequences. In this work, two different sensor technologies were used to quantify the energy expenditure of ageing adults. To this end, a technological platform based on Raspberry Pi 4, as an elaboration unit, was designed and implemented. It integrates an ambient sensor node, a wearable sensor node and a coordinator node that uses the information provided by the two sensor technologies in a combined manner. Ambient and wearable sensors are used for the real-time recognition of four human postures (standing, sitting, bending and lying down), walking activity and for energy expenditure quantification. An important first aim of this work was to realize a platform with a high level of user acceptability. In fact, through the use of two unobtrusive sensors and a low-cost processing unit, the solution is easily accessible and usable in the domestic environment; moreover, it is versatile since it can be used by end-users who accept being monitored by a specific sensor. Another added value of the platform is the ability to abstract from sensing technologies, as the use of human posture and walking activity for energy expenditure quantification enables the integration of a wide set of devices, provided that they can reproduce the same set of features. The obtained results showed the ability of the proposed platform to automatically quantify energy expenditure, both with each sensing technology and with the combined version. Specifically, for posture and walking activity classification, an average accuracy of 93.8% and 93.3% was obtained, respectively, with the wearable and ambient sensor, whereas an improvement of approximately 4% was reached using data fusion. Consequently, the estimated energy expenditure quantification always had a relative error of less than 3.2% for each end-user involved in the experimentation stage, classifying the high level information (postures and walking activities) with the combined version of the platform, justifying the proposed overall architecture from a hardware and software point of view.","Leone, Rescio, Diraco, Manni, Siciliano, Caroppo","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22134893","20220709","AAL; ageing adults; ambient sensor; energy expenditure; posture classification; wearable sensor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33974,""
"The Impact of the Different Stages of COVID-19, Time of the Week and Exercise Frequency on Mental Distress in Men and Women","The COVID-19 pandemic produced life disturbances and loss of routine which affected diet and sleep quality as well as physical exercise frequency. Interestingly, mental distress was higher even in those who exercised. The purpose of this study was to assess exercise frequency in relation to different levels of mental distress severity in men and women while accounting for working days and weekends. A de-identified secondary data set was analyzed. Regression analyses produced models of the different stages of COVID-19 in relation to physical exercise frequency and mental distress levels. Margin analysis generated predictive models that could be used prophylactically to customize physical exercise frequencies in men and women to reduce their risk of mental distress during future pandemics. Mental distress during the lockdown and after ease of restrictions was associated with different physical exercise frequencies, with a noticeable difference between men and women. During a pandemic, sedentary men are more likely to be mentally distressed during working days. Nevertheless, moderately active, but not very active women, may be less distressed during pandemic weekends. These findings may provide a framework to optimize mental health during different stages of a pandemic by customizing physical exercise frequencies based on gender and time of the week.","Begdache, Danesharasteh, Ertem","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14132572","20220709","COVID-19; customization; exercise frequency; gender; mental distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33975,""

"Mental Health and Social Support Are Key Predictors of Resilience in German Women with Endometriosis during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Endometriosis is a multifaceted chronic pain disorder that can have an impact on both physical and mental health. Women suffering from chronic pain may be more susceptible to various health disorders, especially during adversity, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous research has identified resilience as a mediator between internal or external stressors and well-being. An online survey was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany through patient support groups of women with endometriosis. The Brief Resilience Score (BRS) was employed to evaluate resilience, while the PHQ-4 questionnaire was used to assess self-reported mental health. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine resilience's independent risk and protective parameters. High educational level was found to be an independent supportive moderator of high resilience in women with a resilience score greater than the study population's median (BRS &amp;gt; 2.66; OR 2.715; 95% CI 1.472-5.007; <i>p</i> = 0.001) but not in women in the highest resilience score quartile (BRS &amp;gt; 3.33). A decrease in perceived social support was detected to be the most powerful independent risk factor for low resilience: OR 0.541, 95% CI 0.307-0.952, <i>p</i> = 0.033 for predicting BRS &amp;gt; 2.66, and OR 0.397, 95% CI 0.189-0.832, <i>p</i> = 0.014 for predicting scores &amp;gt; 3.33 on the BRS scale. A high burden of mental health symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-4 scale, was negatively associated with resilience. Satisfying social support and good mental health were shown to be key resources for resilience. The results of this study may assist in the identification of women at risk for low resilience and the development of resilience-building strategies in patients with endometriosis.","Schwab, Stewen, Kottmann, Anic, Schmidt, Elger, Theis, Kalb, Brenner, Hasenburg","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11133684","20220709","COVID-19 pandemic; chronic pelvic pain; endometriosis; mental health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33977,""
"Two Years of COVID-19 in Austria-Exploratory Longitudinal Study of Mental Health Outcomes and Coping Behaviors in the General Population","Since the long-term mental health impact of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood, the present study explored changes in mental health outcomes and pandemic-related coping behaviors across four pandemic stages. The main objective was to gain insights into the dynamics of mental health and coping, considering different pandemic features at different assessment waves. The final sample consisted of <i>N</i> = 243 adults from the Austrian general population. Data were collected at four timepoints (between June 2020 and December 2021) via <i>LimeSurvey</i>, an open-source online survey tool. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder (AD), anxiety, and depression were assessed using validated instruments: Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5), AD-New Module 8 (ADNM-8), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ4). We also administered the Pandemic Coping Scale (PCS) to address pandemic-related coping behaviors. Cochran's Q test and repeated measures ANOVAs were applied to assess changes over time. The results indicated that prevalence rates of AD (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(2) = 16.88, <i>p</i> = 0.001), depression (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(3) = 18.69, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(3) = 19.10, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) significantly changed across four assessment waves. Changes in mean scores of the assessed mental health outcomes were also observed. For pandemic-related coping, we found differences in the subscales: healthy lifestyle: <i>F</i>(3, 651) = 5.11, prevention adherence: <i>F</i>(2.73, 592.35) = 21.88, and joyful activities: <i>F</i>(3, 651) = 5.03. Taken together, our study showed a higher mental health burden in wintertime than in summertime, indicating an increased need for psychosocial support in times of stricter measures, higher incidences, and higher death rates. Furthermore, the observed decrease in adaptive coping behaviors suggests that easy-to-implement coping strategies should be actively promoted in order to maintain mental health during and in the aftermath of pandemics.","Lueger-Schuster, ZrniÃ„â€¡ NovakoviÃ„â€¡, Lotzin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19138223","20220709","COVID-19; adjustment disorder; anxiety; coping; depression; longitudinal study; mental health; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33978,""
"A Conceptual Framework for Blockchain Enhanced Information Modeling for Healing and Therapeutic Design","In the face of the health challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, healing and therapeutic design (HTD) as interventions can help with improving people's health. It is considered to have great potential to promote health in the forms of art, architecture, landscape, space, and environment. However, there are insufficient design approaches to address the challenges during the HTD process. An increased number of studies have shown that emerging information modeling (IM) such as building information modeling (BIM), landscape information modeling (LIM), and city information modeling (CIM) coupled with blockchain (BC) functionalities have the potential to enhance designers' HTD by considering important design elements, namely design variables, design knowledge, and design decision. It can also address challenges during the design process, such as design changes, conflicts in design requirements, the lack of design evaluation tools and frameworks, and incomplete design information. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a conceptual BC enhanced IM for HTD (BC-HTD) framework that addresses the challenges in the HTD and promotes health and well-being. The structure of BC-HTD framework is twofold: (1) a conceptual high-level framework comprising three levels: user; system; and information, (2) a conceptual low-level framework of detailed content at the system level, which has been constructed using a mixed quantitative and qualitative method of literature analysis, and validated via a pre-interview questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews with industry experts and academics. This paper analyzes the process of BC enhanced HTD and the knowledge management of HTD to aid design decisions in managing design information. This paper is the first attempt to apply the advantages of BC enabled IM to enhance the HTD process. The results of this study can foster and propel new research pathways and knowledge on the value of design in the form of non-fungible token (NFT) based on the extended advantages of BC in the field of design, which can fully mobilize the healing and therapeutic behaviors of designers and the advantage potential of HTD to promote health, and realize the vision of Health Metaverse in the context of sustainable development.","Liu, Yang, Liang, Liu, Osmani, Demian","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19138218","20220709","Health Metaverse; art therapy; blockchain; building information modeling (BIM); city information modeling (CIM); healing and therapeutic design; landscape information modeling (LIM); mental health; non-fungible token (NFT); sustainable development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33979,""
"Influence of Sociodemographic and Emotional Factors on the Relationship between Self-Compassion and Perceived Stress among Men Residing in Brazil during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The analysis of sociodemographic and emotional factors is essential to understanding how men perceive stress and practice self-compassion. In health crises, this problem becomes an emergency for public health. This study aimed to analyze the influence of sociodemographic and emotional factors on the relationship between self-compassion and the perceived stress of men residing in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a nationwide cross-sectional study carried out between June and December 2020 with 1006 men who completed a semi-structured electronic questionnaire. Data were collected using the snowball technique. Perceived stress was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and self-compassion was assessed using the Self-Compassion Scale. Most men had low self-compassion (51.5%; <i>n</i> = 516) and a moderate level of perceived stress (60.9%; <i>n</i> = 613), while 15.9% (<i>n</i> = 170) had a high level of stress. The prevalence of men in the combined situation of low self-compassion and high perceived stress was 39.4% (<i>n</i> = 334). Living with friends had a higher prevalence of low self-compassion and high perceived stress. The prevalence of common mental disorders was high (54.3%). Men with low levels of self-compassion reported higher levels of perceived stress; however, this association was moderated by emotional and sociodemographic variables. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual and contextual factors in public policies promoting men's mental health.","Palma, de Sousa, Teixeira, Moreira, de AraÃƒÂºjo, Souza, Dos Anjos, de Almeida Portela, de Carvalho, de Oliveira Muniz, Barreto, Almeida, Mota, Dos Santos, da Silva Souza, da Silva, Almeida, LourenÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o, de Queiroz, Fortes JÃƒÂºnior, das Merces, Lima, da Silva, Gomes, Servo, de Santana Carvalho, Barros, De AraÃƒÂºjo, de Oliveira, de Sousa, Mendes","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19138159","20220709","COVID-19; compassion; mental health; menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health; psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33980,""
"Prevention of Loss of Muscle Mass and Function in Older Adults during COVID-19 Lockdown: Potential Role of Dietary Essential Amino Acids","As the COVID-19 pandemic became a global emergency, social distancing, quarantine, and limitations in outdoor activities have resulted in an environment of enforced physical inactivity (EPI). A prolonged period of EPI in older individuals accelerates the deterioration of skeletal muscle health, including loss of muscle mass and function, commonly referred to as sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is associated with an increased likelihood of the progression of diabetes, obesity, and/or depression. Well-known approaches to mitigate the symptoms of sarcopenia include participation in resistance exercise training and/or intake of balanced essential amino acids (EAAs) and high-quality (i.e., containing high EEAs) protein. As the pandemic situation discourages physical exercise, nutritional approaches, especially dietary EAA intake, could be a good alternative for counteracting against EPI-promoted loss of muscle mass and function. Therefore, in the present review, we cover (1) the impact of EPI-induced muscle loss and function on health, (2) the therapeutic potential of dietary EAAs for muscle health (e.g., muscle mass and function) in the EPI condition in comparison with protein sources, and finally (3) practical guidelines of dietary EAA intake for optimal anabolic response in EPI.","Park, Chang, Wolfe, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19138090","20220709","COVID-19; EAA availability; essential amino acids; muscle mass; muscle quality; physical inactivity; protein synthesis; sarcopenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33981,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors and Perceived Mental and Physical Health of People Living with Non-Communicable Diseases: An International Cross-Sectional Survey","The huge burden and vulnerability imposed by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how healthy lifestyle behaviors and the well-being of people living with NCDs need to be prioritized. The aim of our study is to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthy lifestyle behaviors and perceived mental and physical health among adults living with NCDs, as compared to people without NCDs. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a global online survey through Qualtrics. Over four months, 3550 participants from 65 countries worldwide responded to the survey. The study included 3079 surveys with no missing data (complete survey responses) that were used for analysis. People with NCDs were more likely to report statistically significant worsening physical health (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and statistically insignificant worsening mental health (<i>p</i> = 0.354) when compared to pre-pandemic levels. They reported lower rates of smoking during the pandemic than those without NCDs, and a statistically significant (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) relationship was found between weight gain and NCDs. Therefore, the perceived physical and mental health, including changes in body weight and tobacco consumption, of people with NCDs were significantly impacted during the pandemic. In conclusion, this study indicates that the pandemic had a significant impact on perceived physical and mental health, changes in body weight, and tobacco consumption among people with NCDs.","Azzouzi, Stratton, MuÃƒÂ±oz-Velasco, Wang, Fourtassi, Hong, Cooper, Balikuddembe, Palomba, Peterson, Pandiyan, Krassioukov, Tripathi, Tuakli-Wosornu, Hajjioui","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19138023","20220709","COVID-19; healthy lifestyle; mental health; non-communicable diseases; physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33982,""
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception of Cancer Patients towards COVID-19 in Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Study","Cancer patients, being immunocompromised, are at higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The current study determines cancer patients' knowledge, attitude, perception, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Pakistan from 1 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. The study respondents were cancer patients with ages equal to or greater than 18 years. Following a request for participation, the URL for the survey was distributed on numerous channels. Other social media platforms, including WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Messenger, and LinkedIn, were used to increase cancer patient interaction. The questionnaire comprised five different sections such as: (1) sociodemographic information, (2) knowledge, (3) attitude, (4) perception, and (5) impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Descriptive medical statistics such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to illustrate the demographic characteristics of the study participants. To compare mean knowledge scores with selected demographic variables, independent sample <i>t</i>-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used, which are also practical methods in epidemiological, public health and medical research. The cut-off point for statistical significance was set at a <i>p</i>-value of 0.05. More than 300 cancer patients were invited, of which 208 agreed to take part. The response rate was 69.33% (208/300). Gender, marital status, and employment status had a significant association with knowledge scores. Of the total recruited participants, 96% (n = 200) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) knew about COVID-19, and 90% were aware of general symptoms of COVID-19 disease, such as route of transmission and preventive measurements. In total, 94.5% (n = 197) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) were willing to accept isolation if they were infected with COVID-19, and 98% (n = 204) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) had reduced their use of public transportation. More than 90% (n = 188) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) of cancer patients were found to be practicing preventative measures such as using a face mask, keeping social distance, and avoiding handshaking and hugging. Around 94.4% (n = 196) (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) of cancer patients had been impacted by, stopped or had changed cancer treatment during this pandemic, resulting in COVID-related anxiety and depression. The included cancer patients exhibited a good level of COVID-19 knowledge, awareness, positive attitude, and perception. Large-scale studies and efforts are needed to raise COVID-19 awareness among less educated and high-risk populations.

We included 12,467 participants aged 15 years old or above from the 2017 Migrant Population Dynamic Monitoring Survey (MDMS). We used univariate analysis and logistic regression models to access the association between social integration, exclusion status, and influenza vaccination rates. Results suggested that the association between social integration and the vaccination rate was significantly positive. Moving between different districts impact on people's mental health and their health performance. Significant association between influenza vaccination behavior and education attainment, income status, health record, and awareness of basic public health services program was reported. Therefore, in order to reduce the incidence of influenza disease and increase the vaccination rate, policymakers and the public should promote social integration for internal migrants.

"Post-Migration Stressors and Mental Health for African Migrants in South Australia: A Qualitative Study","We conducted a qualitative study involving African migrants (<i>n</i> = 20) and service providers (<i>n</i> = 10) in South Australia to explore mental health stressors, access to mental health services and how to improve mental health services for African migrant populations. This paper presents the views and experiences of African migrants about the post-migration stressors they faced in resettlement that pose mental health challenges. The participants were recruited using the snowball sampling technique. To align with the COVID-19 pandemic protocol, the data collection was conducted using one-on-one online interviews through Zoom or WhatsApp video calls. Data analysis was guided by the framework analysis. The post-migration stressors, including separation from family members and significant others, especially spouses, imposed significant difficulties on care provision and in managing children's attitudes and behavior-related troubles at school. African cultural practices involving the community, especially elders in care provision and disciplining children, were not consistent with Australian norms, compounding the mental health stressors for all involved. The African cultural norms, that do not allow young unmarried people to live together, also contributed to child-parent conflicts, enhancing parental mental stressors. Additionally, poor economic conditions and employment-related difficulties were post-migration stressors that the participants faced. The findings indicate the need for policy and intervention programs that address the above challenges. The provision of interventions, including social support such as subsidized or free childcare services, could help leverage their time and scheduled paid employment, creating time for effective parenting and improving their mental health and wellbeing. Future studies exploring what needs to be achieved by government and non-governmental institutions to support enhanced access to social and employment opportunities for the African migrant population are also recommended.","Mwanri, Fauk, Ziersch, Gesesew, Asa, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137914","20220709","African migrants; Australia; mental health challenges; post-migration stressors; refugees; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33985,""
"The Critical Need for a Meaning-Centered Team-Level Intervention to Address Healthcare Provider Distress Now","COVID-19 has unveiled and amplified the burnout, grief, and other forms of distress among healthcare providers (HCPs) that long preceded the pandemic. The suffering of the healthcare workforce cannot be simply and sufficiently addressed with a single psychotherapeutic intervention. Nevertheless, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Studies recommended prioritizing interventions that generate an increased sense of meaning in life and in work to reduce burnout and cultivate clinician wellbeing. Despite their guidance, there is a dearth of interventions for HCPs specifically targeting meaning and purpose as an avenue to reduce HCP distress. In a time when such an intervention has never been more essential, Meaning-Centered Pyschotherapy (MCP), a brief, evidence-based intervention designed for patients with advanced cancer may be key. This piece describes the principles underlying MCP and how it might be adapted and applied to ameliorate burnout among HCPs while providing a rationale to support future empirical studies in this area. Importantly, the systemic factors that contribute to the emotional and mental health burdens of HCPs are discussed, emphasizing the need for systems-level changes that are needed to leverage the potential outcomes of MCP for HCPs.","Rosa, Roberts, Schlak, Applebaum, Breitbart, Kantoff, Pessin, Lichtenthal","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137801","20220709","COVID-19; burnout; meaning-centered psychotherapy; moral distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33986,""
"How Italy Tweeted about COVID-19: Detecting Reactions to the Pandemic from Social Media","The COVID-19 pandemic required communities throughout the world to deal with unknown threats. Using Twitter data, this study aimed to detect reactions to the outbreak in Italy and to evaluate the relationship between measures derived from social media (SM) with both national epidemiological data and reports on the violations of the restrictions. The dynamics of time-series about tweets counts, emotions expressed, and themes discussed were evaluated using Italian posts regarding COVID-19 from 25 February to 4 May 2020. Considering 4,988,255 tweets, results highlight that emotions changed significantly over time with anger, disgust, fear, and sadness showing a downward trend, while joy, trust, anticipation, and surprise increased. The trend of emotions correlated significantly with national variation in confirmed cases and reports on the violations of restrictive measures. The study highlights the potential of using SM to assess emotional and behavioural reactions, delineating their possible contribution to the establishment of a decision management system during emergencies.","Lorenzoni, Andreozzi, Bazzani, Casigliani, Pirri, Tavoschi, Turchetti","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137785","20220709","COVID-19; Twitter; emergency management; emotional and behavioural reaction; health emergency; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33987,""
"Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms and Associated Factors in Community-Dwelling Persons at the First Time of Dementia Diagnosis","Community-dwelling residents at potential risk of dementia and their families have difficulty detecting symptoms of dementia during an outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). We explored the characteristics of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in community-dwelling persons at the first time of dementia diagnosis and identified their associated variables. A cross-sectional study using secondary data of dementia diagnosis tests was conducted. Data were reported by professional nurses and clinicians from 355 persons at the first time of dementia diagnosis in South Korea. BPSD and their associated variables were measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-K) assessment handbook and electronic medical records. The most common symptoms were apathy/indifference (72.1%), followed by irritability/lability (42.8%) and depression/dysphoria (42.0%).

"The Unique Role of Hope and Optimism in the Relationship between Environmental Quality and Life Satisfaction during COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 in Malaysia has significantly affected the higher education system of the country and increased the level of distress among university students. Empirical evidence proposed that environment quality is associated with university students' life satisfaction during COVID-19. It was found that hope and optimism are linked with greater life satisfaction in general. Although past literature has reported the effects of hope and optimism on life satisfaction, there are limited studies examining the underlying mechanism among Malaysian private university students. Therefore, the current study offers the preliminary understanding of the intervening role of hope and optimism on the relationship between environmental quality and life satisfaction among private university students in Malaysia. A total of 133 private university students in Malaysia were recruited through homogenous convenience sampling. Partial least square structure equation modeling (SmartPLS) was used to analyze the mediation models. The results revealed that only hope mediated the relationship between environmental quality and life satisfaction, but not optimism. Hence, it is proposed that mental health providers should focus on providing hope-related interventions to university students in confronting COVID-19 challenges and ultimately improving life satisfaction.","Wider, Taib, Khadri, Yip, Lajuma, Punniamoorthy","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137661","20220709","environmental quality; hope; life satisfaction; optimism; private university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33991,""
"Barriers to Seeking Mental Help and Interventions to Remove Them in Medical School during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives of Students","Medical students are at increased risk for psychological morbidity but the majority of those with mental health problems do not seek professional care. We aimed to uncover the viewpoints of medical students regarding barriers and facilitators to using university mental health services and their attitudes and preferences towards online counselling. Four semi-structured focus groups were conducted (<i>n</i> = 26, mean age = 21.8, Ã‚Â±1.88, 73% males). After reaching data saturation, interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and content-analysed by two independent coders. Intrapersonal barriers emerged to be perceived low risk, excessive self-reliance, lack of belief in the effectiveness of service, lack of openness. Interpersonal factors were the following: assumed long waiting list, insufficient provision of service information, fear of exposure, and not being familiar with the counsellor and the process. Extrapersonal barriers such as insurance problems, the number of available sessions, adverse sociocultural attitudes, fear of stigmatisation were identified. Students suggested that the university should provide psychoeducation and routine screening, apply social marketing and stigma reduction campaigns, improve information flow, and offer not only personal but also online video counselling to target removing these barriers. The results provide a reference for the redesign of mental health services to facilitate their access by students.

This study investigates the changes in dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors among Saudi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 786 participants, with a mean age of 30 years. The questionnaire was administered online and sent via social media applications. Dietary habits, physical activity, TV-watching time, sleep patterns, stressors, and socio-demographic data were evaluated. Among the survey respondents, there was an increase in weight gain, food consumption, and decreased physical activity. Respondents who gained weight consumed more snacks, ate larger food portions, and engaged in less physical activity. Furthermore, a high fish, water, and supplements intake was noticed. Although respondents' intake of fruits and vegetables was low, most individuals reported a negatively changed intake. However, most respondents reported increased consumption of lean meat and sweet foods. Observing changes in dietary and lifestyle habits during the lockdown period may help elaborate on the pandemic's consequences for population health and assist in formulating and implementing policies for future closures, while supporting vulnerable groups.","Bushnaq, Algheshairy, Almujaydil, Malki, Alharbi, Barakat","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137659","20220709","COVID-19; coronavirus; cross-sectional; eating habits; lifestyle behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33993,""
"Evaluation of Expressive Arts Therapy on the Resilience of University Students in COVID-19: A Network Analysis Approach","As an alternative to traditional verbal counselling, expressive arts therapy has been shown to be an effective method of mental health care, particularly when dealing with stressful public interactions, such as those associated with COVID-19. However, few studies have been conducted to determine the efficacy of expressive arts therapy on the resilience of psychologically exposed university students during COVID-19. Furthermore, since network analysis appears to be a popular approach in psychological research, it has not been used in recent intervention studies for resilience. As a result, the current study utilized a network analysis approach to determine the efficacy of expressive arts therapy on the resilience of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 263 students in a comprehensive university in China were selected for the therapy group between March and November 2021. In a pre-post design, students' resilience was assessed using the Resiliency Scale for University Students (RSUS). The extended Bayesian information criteria (EBIC) and graphical LASSO were used to estimate and define paired resilience networks, and the strength, betweenness, and closeness indices were utilized to determine the centrality of the six facets of resilience. Additionally, we verified the stability and accuracy. It was discovered that significant differences appeared between the paired networks before and after expressive arts therapy. Facets of self-efficacy, self-acceptance and problem-solving in resilience were notably improved after the therapy, with the variable of emotional stability sustained at the mean level. Meanwhile, the network analysis has highlighted the central variable of self-efficacy in the pre-intervention and support from friends in the post-intervention.

"Exploring the Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 Social Restrictions on International University Students: A Qualitative Study","The global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the mental well-being of university students, but little attention has been given to international students, who may have a unique experience and perspective. The aim of this study was to explore the views of international students and university staff towards COVID-19 restrictions, self-isolation, their well-being, and support needs, through eight online focus groups with international students (<i>n</i> = 29) and semi-structured interviews with university staff (<i>n</i> = 17) at a higher education institution in England. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach, revealing three key themes and six subthemes: (1) practical, academic, and psychological challenges faced during self-isolation and the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) coping strategies to self-isolation and life during the pandemic; and (3) views on further support needed for international students. International students faced practical, academic, and psychological challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly relating to the rapid transition to online learning and the impact of social restrictions on integration with peers and well-being. Online social connections with peers, family, or new acquaintances reduced feelings of isolation and encouraged involvement in university life. Despite raising mental health concerns, most international students did not access mental health support services. Staff related this to perceived stigma around mental health in certain cultural groups. In conclusion, international students experienced specific practical and emotional challenges during the pandemic, and are at risk of mental ill-health, but may not actively seek out support from university services. Proactive and personalised approaches to student support will be important for positive student experiences and the retention of students who are studying abroad in the UK higher education system.","Al-Oraibi, Fothergill, Yildirim, Knight, Carlisle, O'Connor, Briggs, Morling, Corner, Ball, Denning, Vedhara, Blake","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137631","20220709","COVID-19; higher education; mental health; social isolation; students; university; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33995,""
"Greater Emotional Distress Due to Social Distancing and Greater Symptom Severity during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Individuals with Bipolar Disorder: A Multicenter Study in Austria, Germany, and Denmark","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health of individuals with bipolar disorders (BD) is potentially more vulnerable, especially regarding COVID-19-related regulations and associated symptomatic changes. A multicentric online study was conducted in Austria, Germany, and Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, data from 494 participants were collected (203 individuals with BD, 291 healthy controls (HC)). Participants filled out questionnaires surveying emotional distress due to social distancing, fear of COVID-19, and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 to assess symptom severity at four points of measurement between 2020 and 2021. General linear mixed models were calculated to determine the difference between the groups in these pandemic specific factors. Individuals with BD reported higher distress due to social distancing than HC, independently of measurement times. Fear of COVID-19 did not differ between groups; however, it was elevated in times of higher infection and mortality due to COVID-19. Individuals with BD reported higher psychiatric symptom severity than HC; however, symptom severity decreased throughout the measured time in the pandemic. Overall, individuals with BD experienced more distress due to the COVID-19 situation than HC. A supportive mental health system is thus recommended to ensure enhanced care, especially in times of strict COVID-19-related regulations.","SchÃƒÂ¶nthaler, Dalkner, Ratzenhofer, Fleischmann, Fellendorf, Bengesser, Birner, Maget, Lenger, Platzer, Queissner, Tmava-Berisha, Berndt, Martini, Bauer, Sperling, Vinberg, Reininghaus","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137626","20220709","COVID-19; anxiety; bipolar disorder; pandemic; social distancing; symptom load","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33996,""
"COVID-19-What Price Do Children Pay? An Analysis of Economic and Social Policy Factors","Numerous studies have addressed the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for children such as social isolation or increases in reported child maltreatment. Research on the economic and sociopolitical consequences is scarce as they can only be evaluated with a time lag. To improve our understanding of future, long-term developments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we gathered findings from the still unexploited empirical literature on the aftermath of earlier pandemics, epidemics, and other infectious disease outbreaks. On top of this, we scrutinized research on past economic crises to interpret the link between changes in the economy and the health of children. Many of the side effects of battling the spread of the current pandemic, such as school closures, the stigma of infection, or conflicts about vaccines, are not novel and have already been documented in connection with previous infectious disease outbreaks. Results highlight that changes in the financial situation of families and socio-political challenges affect the situation and daily routine of children and youth in the long term. In consequence, the already pronounced socioeconomic inequalities will likely further increase. On top of this, due to reduced revenues, child protective services are likely to face challenges in the availability of human and financial resources.","Lange, Altrock, Gossmann, Fegert, Jud","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137604","20220709","COVID-19; children and adolescents; economic consequences; mental health; social conflicts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33997,""
"Psychological and Physical Changes Caused by COVID-19 Pandemic in Elementary and Junior High School Teachers: A Cross-Sectional Study","This study aimed to determine psychological and physical differences in elementary and junior high school teachers during COVID-19. This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 427 teachers in Tokyo, Japan (between 15 and 30 October 2020). The questionnaire explored school type (elementary and middle schools), sex, age, and COVID-19 changes (psychological changes, physical changes, impact on work, and infection control issues perceived to be stressed). Post hoc tests for <i>I cannot concentrate on work at all</i>, found a significant difference for <i>no change-improved</i> and <i>male teacher in elementary school female teacher in junior high school</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.03).

COVID-19 produced differences in psychological and physical changes between male and female teachers in elementary and junior high schools.

"Exploring the Impacts of Preventative Health Behaviors with Respect to COVID-19: An Altruistic Perspective","This study aims to explore the impact of gender and anxiety on various preventative health behaviors, and the relationships among these preventative health behaviors, individual well-being and depression, from the perspective of altruism. This study employed an online questionnaire survey, and 136 males and 204 females participated in the survey. The results of this study showed that females exhibited better preventative health behaviors than males, including hygiene habits, social distancing and behaviors intended to help others mitigate the epidemic. Anxiety regarding COVID-19 infection encouraged individuals to adopt hygienic habits and social distancing measures rather than to help others mitigate the epidemic. Hygiene habits improved the individual's psychological well-being. Helping others mitigate the epidemic improved the individual's psychological well-being and social well-being and contributed to reducing individual depression. However, the preventative health behavior involved in social distancing was not conducive to emotional well-being or social well-being. Affective elements are related to individual behaviors. Therefore, the use of prosocial, altruistic language may play an important role with respect to encouraging people to comply with preventative health behaviors in the context of COVID-19. In addition, it is worth noting that different preventative health behaviors may have different effects on people's mental health, especially when implementing social distancing-related epidemic mitigation behaviors. The question of how to prevent negative psychological effects in restricted actors must be answered, and the degree of life satisfaction experienced by those actors must also be taken into account.","Luo, Yang, Hung, Chou","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137573","20220709","COVID-19 preventive health behaviors; altruism; depression; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",33999,""

"The Role of Selected Psychological Factors in Healthy-Sustainable Food Consumption Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent precautions and dispositions adopted have triggered substantial changes in daily health-related behaviors, including food consumption habits. The psychological impact of the pandemic has been considered one of the factors affecting this transition and requiring consideration when targeting healthy-sustainable behavior preservation. The present study describes the results of a survey conducted on a convenience sample of Italian residents (<i>n</i> = 2272) during the first phases of pandemic. The aim was to explore the daily nutritional choices and behaviors and their transformations that occurred along with the associations with psychological factors (i.e., subjective well-being, and depression, anxiety and stress symptoms). An indicator for healthy-sustainable transition (HST index) was constructed and revealed diffused transformation in dietary habits, with a large segment of the sample adopting healthier and more sustainable dietary behaviors and others showing reduced healthy-sustainable food choices. Informative relationships with the psychological variables were then found from the correlational and regression analyses. Lower levels of anxiety, depression and stress symptomatology and higher perceived subjective well-being were significantly associated with healthier-sustainable food consumption behaviors. These findings shed light on the crucial areas to be considered in future institutional interventions, ultimately ensuring favorable conditions for both healthy diet behaviors and sustainable food consumption choices.","Zanatta, Mari, Adorni, Labra, Matacena, Zenga, D'Addario","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11131944","20220709","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; health behaviors; healthy-sustainable diets; lockdown; nutrition; pandemic; stress; subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",34001,""
"Disenfranchised Guilt-Pet Owners' Burden","Guilt refers to an unpleasant emotional state associated with one's behaviors, thoughts, or intentions, and it is based on the possibility that one may be in the wrong or that others may have this perception. Parental guilt is one common subtype and is often associated with work-family conflict (WFC). WFC and related guilt have been found to be associated with depression and anxiety. Through an online anonymous survey, the current study was designed to explore dog owners' guilt surrounding their dogs. Results suggest that dog owners' guilt and WFC associated with their dog are at levels similar to those reported in human family studies. Additionally, the relationship between dog owners' guilt and discrepancy between participants' actual and ideal self, in regard to the role of a dog owner, also mirrored human-only family research. Because pet-related guilt is unrecognized, acknowledged, or supported, we suggest it is disenfranchised. As people return to work, in this period of post-COVID-19 pandemic time, it is paramount that companies and communities acknowledge pet owner guilt and WFC and help owners find practical, effective solutions.","Kogan, Bussolari, Currin-McCulloch, Packman, Erdman","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12131690","20220709","dog; guilt; parental guilt; workÃ¢â‚¬â€œfamily conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",34002,""
"Accessing Antenatal Care (ANC) services during the COVID-19 first wave: insights into decision-making inÃ‚Â rural India","Antenatal care (ANC) services are a prime focus of the Government of India's National Health Mission (NHM), of which a key pillar is the promotion of maternal and child health. To ensure uninterrupted service delivery at the last mile, a cadre of Frontline Health Workers (FLHWs) has been appointed and health centres established at the village level. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown from late March to June 2020 impacted pregnant women's access to institutional antenatal care services. Using a qualitative research design, data was collected through 12 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with pregnant women and 17 IDIs with frontline health workers in the selected six districts under study. The narratives were analysed using inductive coding in Atlas.ti. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women, most of whom belonged to poor and marginalised groups, were left with limited access to health centres and FLHWs. Respondents from the study areas of rural Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh extensively reported concerns stemming from the lockdown that influenced their decision to access ANC services. These included anxieties around meeting their families' daily needs due to a loss of livelihood (in particular, abject food insecurity), inability to access healthcare, and a sense of mistrust in public health systems and functionaries. All of these, coupled with the real threat to health posed by COVID-19, disrupted their plans for pregnancy and delivery, further compunding the risk to their health and wellbeing. This study identified several social, behavioural and structural facets of the communities that contributed to the confusion, anxiety and helplessness experienced during the COVID-19 first wave by both groups, viz. pregnant women and FLHWs. In planningÃ‚Â and implementing initiaves to ensure the delivery and uptake of ANC services in this and similar contexts during times of crisis, these facets must be considered. This article highlights the status of ANC services during the nationwide lockdown imposed in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian states of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Data was collected through 12 in-depth interviews with pregnant women and 17 in-depth interviews with frontline health workers. Findings suggest that pregnant women were aware of the unprecedented threat of COVID-19 and recommended protective measures through trusted sources of information, including their local Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA). However, both pregnant women and FLHWs believed that the information they received on the health risks of the pandemic and strategies to address these was inadequate. Temporary suspension of health services in the rural countryside meant that pregnant women could not track the foetus's health status, resulting in confusion and distress. Limited or no interaction with FLHWs, coupled with a reported lack of attention to conditions unrelated to COVID-19 and discrimination at healthcare institutions increased the uncertainty around institutional deliveries. This was further heightened by the loss of livelihoods due to the shutdown of businesses during the lockdown, as the respondents could not turn to private hospitals for childbirth. This resulted in the collapse of the trust of pregnant women and their families in the public healthcare system. To bridge this gap and alleviate the sense of mistrust the pandemic has created in its end-users, strategies to improve the utilisation of health services should respond to the barriers identified in this study.","Bankar, Ghosh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-022-01446-2","20220708","Antenatal care services; Behavioral principles; COVID-19; Childbirth; India; Pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",34003,""
"Comparing stress and behavioral coping strategies during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis among domestic and overseas Taiwanese","This study reported domestic and overseas Taiwanese people's perceived stress levels and examined the mediation effect of their coping strategies during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 2727 Taiwanese respondents from the COVIDiSTRESS Global Survey (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°173,426) between March 30 and May 30, 2020. The self-report questionnaire included a modified 10-item Perceived Stress Scale and a 16-item coping strategy scale. Three stress-coping factors were extracted with principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Their effects were examined through a regression and mediation analysis. The overseas Taiwanese participants had a significantly higher stress level than domestic counterparts (2.89 to 2.69 in 1-5 scale, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Government guidance was associated with lower stress level among domestic (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.097, 95% C.I.

"Interpersonal therapy versus antidepressant medication for treatment of postpartum depression and anxiety among women with HIV in Zambia: a randomized feasibility trial","Postpartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent and debilitating disease that may affect medication adherence and thus maternal health and vertical transmission among women with HIV. We assessed the feasibility of a trial of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) versus antidepressant medication (ADM) to treat PPD and/or anxiety among postpartum women with HIV in Lusaka, Zambia. Between 29 October 2019 and 8 September 2020, we pre-screened women 6-8 weeks after delivery with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and diagnosed PPD or anxiety with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Consenting participants were randomized 1:1 to up to 11 sessions of IPT or daily self-administered sertraline and followed for 24 weeks. We assessed EPDS score, Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and medication side effects at each visit and measured maternal HIV viral load at baseline and final study visit. Retention, visit adherence, change in EPDS, CGI-S and log viral load were compared between groups with t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests; we report mean differences, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. A participant satisfaction survey assessed trial acceptability. 78/80 (98%) participants were retained at the final study visit. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, visit adherence was greater among women allocated to ADM (9.9 visits, SD 2.2) versus IPT (8.9 visits, SD 2.4; p = 0.06). EPDS scores decreased from baseline to final visit overall, though mean change was greater in the IPT group (-13.8 points, SD 4.7) compared to the ADM group (-11.4Ã‚Â points, SD 5.5; p = 0.04). Both groups showed similar changes in mean log viral load from baseline to final study visit (mean difference -0.43, 95% CI -0.32, 1.18; p = 0.48). In the IPT group, viral load decreased significantly from baseline (0.9 log copies/ml, SD 1.7) to final visit (0.2 log copies/ml, SD 0.9; p = 0.01). This pilot study demonstrates that a trial of two forms of PPD treatment is feasible and acceptable among women with HIV in Zambia. IPT and ADM both improved measures of depression severity; however, a full-scale trial is required to determine whether treatment of PPD and anxiety improves maternal-infant HIV outcomes.","Spelke, Paul, Blette, Meltzer-Brody, Schiller, Ncheka, Kasaro, Price, Stringer, Stringer","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25959","20220708","HIV infection; Zambia; antidepressive agents; anxiety; depression; postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",34005,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of radiography staff and managers in Northern Ireland, UK: The radiography managers' perspective","Increasing evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the mental health of health professionals, including radiographers. Less is known about the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of radiography managers. Radiography managers have led their teams through the pandemic, making unpopular decisions to safeguard staff and patients. This study explores radiography managers' perceptions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of themselves and their staff. Ethical approval was obtained from the NHS Research Ethics Committee (ID 287032). Eleven interviews were conducted with therapeutic and diagnostic radiography managers between March-April 2021. Written information was also included from a paediatric diagnostic radiography manager. Data was analysed independently by 2 researchers using thematic analysis. Three central themes emerged: 1) Factors perceived to have negatively influenced mental health, which included changing PPE guidance, restructuring of work conditions, social isolation, challenges to patient care and lack of quality vacation leave. 2) Factors perceived to have positively influenced mental health, which included witnessing staff resilience and team camaraderie. 3) Support provided for mental health. Managers felt that they had implemented appropriate strategies to support their staff throughout the first year of the pandemic and expressed feeling responsible for the wellbeing of their staff. Strong empathy was evident towards staff and their experiences. Despite the availability of mental health support services, managers felt that resources were underutilised by radiography teams. Managers should be proactive in communicating their appreciation for their staff in an era where remote working can add to disconnect between staff and management. Mental health support services should be promoted and continually reviewed, to ensure that appropriate support services are maintained.","Flood, McFadden, Shepherd","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2022.06.011","20220708","COVID-19; Experience; Manager; Mental health; Radiographer; Radiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",34006,""
"Questionnaire survey about the effects of new lifestyles during the pandemic of COVID-19 on upper limb diseases","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that emerged in 2019 and spread globally in 2020 has resulted in the imposition of lockdowns or a state of emergency in many cities worldwide. In Japan, a ""new lifestyle"" is being advocated. We hypothesize that the new lifestyle has changed people's use of their upper limbs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, through this questionnaire study, we aimed to determine the factors associated with exacerbation of symptoms during the pandemic and to investigate the current status of patients who require hand surgery. This study was a prospective multi-center questionnaire survey. This study was conducted in Japan from December 2020 to July 2021Ã‚Â at university and general hospitals in nine prefectures. A questionnaire was administered to patients who visited a hospital with symptoms of nerve entrapment syndrome, osteoarthritis, or tenosynovitis. A total of 502 patients with a mean age of 63.8 years responded. The 240 patients who experienced exacerbation (exacerbated and markedly exacerbated) were compared with other patients (unchanged, improved, and markedly improved). An increase in the time spent on personal computers and smartphones was associated with exacerbation of hand symptoms. Patients who wanted to undergo surgery but were postponed due to COVID-19 accounted for 23.5% of the outpatients. The mean scores for pain, jitteriness, and anxious depression in these patients were significantly higher than those of patients who did not want surgery. Our results suggest that an increase in the time spent on personal computers and smartphones is associated with exacerbation of hand symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients who wanted to undergo surgery but were postponed by COVID-19 experienced greater pain, jitteriness, and anxious depression.","Iwatsuki, Hashizume, Hara, Okui, Morizaki, Tada, Matsui, Ishii, Hirata","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jos.2022.06.005","20220708","COVID-19; Nerve entrapment syndrome; Osteoarthritis; Questionnaire; Smartphone; Tenosynovitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","",34007,""
"Reckless spreader or blameless victim? How vaccination status affects responses to COVID-19 patients","Background Vaccination against Covid-19 has become an increasingly polarizing issue in western democracies. While much research has focused on social-psychological determinants of vaccine hesitancy, less is known about the attitudes and behaviors of the vaccinated populations towards those who are unvaccinated. Building on Weiner's attribution theory (2005, 1985, 1980), we predict that vaccination status determines the attribution of personal responsibility and blame in Covid-19 social dilemmas. This in turn explains people's affective and behavioral responses towards those who have fallen ill or infected others with COVID-19. Approach Through two preregistered experiments (total N = 1200) we show that people attribute greater personal responsibility when unvaccinated (vs. vaccinated) people fall ill from, or infect others with COVID-19. This attribution of responsibility manifested in less sympathy towards unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, which was associated with a lower willingness to help patients and their families (Study 1). Likewise, higher perceived responsibility results in greater anger towards unvaccinated people who had (involuntarily) infected others with the virus, which was associated with a greater desire for punitive actions (Study 2).
