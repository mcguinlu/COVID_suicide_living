"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of COVID-19: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","ABSTRACT Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the COVID-19  With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugsâ€™ neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications  Methods Literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950-2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  Review First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels  Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents  Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible, and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of â€œpsychosis following chloroquine â€ Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports  It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications, however, overdose on these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality  Conclusion The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for COVID-19 treatment is not known  Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine  However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for COVID-19, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine","Hamm, Brandon S., Rosenthal, Lisa J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020.; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2608,""

"The Mortality and Psychological Burden Caused by Response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a Hypothesis and a Crude Estimation","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak  To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures  We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis)  To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach  First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in that country  Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario  We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality  The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19  Roughly we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands for the period of 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures  To support the hypothesis on the effect of COVID-19 curbing measures on mental health, we performed literature search on quarantine policy during precious SARS-CoV-2 outbreak  The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy","Yusuf, Erlangga, Tisler, Anna","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Medical Hypotheses;2020.; Publication details: Medical Hypotheses;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2610,""

"â€œI feel like death on legsâ€: COVID-19 isolation and mental health","This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies  Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic  None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on peopleâ€™s movements  This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse  Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel societyâ€™s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories  The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war  In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on peopleâ€™s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on  Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies  I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month  The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015)  The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others  The analysis of the news reports show that Britainâ€™s priorities are centered on the governmentâ€™s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19","Herat, Manel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Social Sciences & Humanities Open;2020.; Publication details: Social Sciences & Humanities Open;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2616,""

(Infektionsschutzgesetz)?overriding other elements of the legal order  They also limited the government?s use of scientific expertise to a small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the appropriateness or otherwise of the government?s crisis measures  Finally, German actors failed to understand that some of the earlier Chinese and Korean responses required a precondition?namely public willingness to sacrifice privacy for public health?that is absent in the German case","Michael Dostal, JÃ¶rg","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-923X.12865","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Political Quarterly;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication details: The Political Quarterly;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2618,""

"Challenges in the Practice of Sexual Medicine in the Time of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom","BACKGROUND: On 23rd March 2020, the UK government released self-isolation/social distancing guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents preplanned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: ""On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?"" Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34Â years. During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should considerÂ positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation/social distancing and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.

"Physical health among people with serious mental illness in the face of COVID-19: Concerns and mitigation strategies","COVID-19 can worsen the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness, a vulnerable group already facing physical health disparities. COVID-19 is further reducing access to physical health care due to shutdown of services deemed &quot;non-urgent&quot; and overcrowding of emergency services. Management of chronic diseases, highly prevalent in this group, is undermined due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, reduction in availability of social support, and worsening of negative social determinants of health. In this commentary, we discuss the challenges experienced by this group and offer mitigation strategies to reduce: (1) inequalities in access to physical health care; and (2) disruptions to the management of chronic physical conditions in the face of COVID-19. Recommendations include coordinated efforts by health authorities, primary and mental health care organizations, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These efforts should ensure equitable access to physical health care and implementation of innovative programs to protect the physical health of people with serious mental illness during and following the pandemic.","Melamed, Hahn, Agarwal, Taylor, Mulsant, Selby","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.013","20200709","Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Chronic medical conditions; Health services; Physical health; Primary care; Quality of health care; Schizophrenia; Serious mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2628,""

"Understanding the Perceived Mental Health of Canadians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","While the physical health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are regularly publicly available, the mental health toll on Canadians is unknown. This article examines the self-perceived mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores associations with various concerns after accounting for socioeconomic and health factors. The cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1 collected information related to COVID-19 in late March and early April 2020 concerning labour market participation, behaviours, and health for the Canadian population 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces. Socioeconomic and health characteristics of respondents as well as concerns about the impact of COVID-19 were examined to determine differences in experiencing excellent or very good compared to good, fair or poor perceived mental health. Just over half of Canadians aged 15 and older (54%) reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several concerns were also associated with mental health. Notably, after considering the effects of socioeconomic and health characteristics, women, youth, individuals with a physical health condition and those who were very or extremely concerned with family stress from confinement were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health. These findings point to particular risks for lower perceived mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight various concerns of Canadians which may be associated with mental health, in particular, family stress in the home.","Findlay, Arim, Kohen","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000400003-eng","20200709","COVID-19; concerns; family stress; perceived mental health; social determinants of mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2631,""
"Psychological and Ocular Surface State of Ophthalmologists and Ophthalmic Nurses Working With Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019","The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood. To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000) and 0.07% (21 of 30Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000; 21 of 35Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90Ã¢â‚¬â€°(2.30), 7.38Ã¢â‚¬â€°(2.19), 24.52Ã¢â‚¬â€°(5.86), and 43.90Ã¢â‚¬â€°(3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67Ã¢â‚¬â€°(3.04), 9.38Ã¢â‚¬â€°(2.64), 21.48Ã¢â‚¬â€°(6.15), and 40.05Ã¢â‚¬â€°(6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67Ã¢â‚¬â€°(2.89), 4.90Ã¢â‚¬â€°(3.15), 12.76Ã¢â‚¬â€°(7.27), and 38.79Ã¢â‚¬â€°(7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67Ã¢â‚¬â€°(3.20), 4.33Ã¢â‚¬â€°(3.23), 10.10Ã¢â‚¬â€°(7.62), and 41.52Ã¢â‚¬â€°(5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.","Shao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.2289","20200709","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2632,""

The AUDIT-3 scale was included. A representative trial of 113 physicians participated in the study. Over 53% of screened doctors revealed that the amounts of the consumed alcohol have escalated; almost 20% of subjects binged over seven standard drinks for one occasion. Close to every second used six or more drinks on one occasion. Over 40% used alcohol more than four times per week. Female used alcohol more often and more standard drinks per occasion. Male binged more. Anxiety and hopelessness were the most common motives to drink. Alcohol consumption in physicians in quarantine has threateningly increased.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice in India: Results of an Anonymized National Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge for medical professionals throughout the world to tackle the rapidly changing scenario. The objective of this survey was to analyze the change in neurosurgical practice in India following the COVID-19 outbreak and assess its impact on practising neurosurgeons. Between May 7<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated amongst practising neurosurgeons across the country by social media and e-mails, regarding changes in the patterns of patients seen, adaptations made in their practice, effect on surgeries performed, financial burden, and impact on their personal lives. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for correlations between the changes observed and independent factors such as hospital affiliations, teaching professions, and neurosurgical experience. Our survey showed a drastic fall in the number of neurosurgical patients seen in the outpatient department (OPD) as well as the number of surgeries performed. A drop of 76.25% was seen in OPD patients (P = 0.000) and that of 70.59% in surgeries performed (P = 0.000). There was no uniformity among the neurosurgeons in the number of COVID-19 tests being done before elective/emergency surgery and in the use of protective gear while examining patients. Private practitioners were more affected financially as compared to those in the government sector. The pandemic has affected the research work of 53.23% of all respondents, with those in the teaching profession (70.96%) more affected than those in the non-teaching profession (24.67%). Evidence-based policies, screening COVID-19 tests with better sensitivity, and better-quality personal protective equipment kits in adequate numbers are required to protect our medical professionals from COVID-19. Mental health issues among neurosurgeons may also be an issue, this being a high risk speciality and should be closely watched for.","Venkataram, Goyal, Dash, Chandra, Chaturvedi, Raheja, Singla, Sardhara, Singh, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.289004","20200709","COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019); India; neurosurgical practice; personal protective equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2635,""
"Association between social support and anxiety among pregnant women in the third trimester during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Qingdao, China: The mediating effect of risk perception","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a threat to the mental health of pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social support and anxiety, and the mediating effect of risk perception during the COVID-19 epidemic in the third trimester pregnant women in Qingdao, China. From 16 to 21 February 2020, an online survey was conducted, which collected the information on demographic data, anxiety, social support and risk perception to COVID-19 of women with established medical records in the ambulatory of the Department of Obstetrics at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Anxiety was assessed by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), social support was assessed by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and risk perception was assessed by a self-designed questionnaire. This study had 308 participants with an average of 31.02 Ã‚Â± 3.91 years. During the period of prevention and control of the epidemic, most pregnant women adopted protective measures, such as wearing masks (97.4%), washing hands frequently (88.3%) and staying at home (76.3%).

"Use of technology by orientation and mobility professionals in Australia and Malaysia before COVID-19","Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) professionals teach people with low vision or blindness to use specialist assistive technologies to support confident travel, but many O&amp;M clients now prefer a smartphone. This study aimed to investigate what technology O&amp;M professionals in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client work, to inform the development of O&amp;M technologies and build capacity in the international O&amp;M profession. A technology survey was completed by professionals (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36) attending O&amp;M workshops in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&amp;M specialists (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&amp;M professionals. Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data. Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&amp;M professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to use technology during O&amp;M client programmes, initial professional training, ongoing professional development and research. Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and early-adopter O&amp;M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&amp;M professionals need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream O&amp;M technologies to expand clients' travel choices. COVID-19 has created an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&amp;M tele-practice. O&amp;M technology could support comprehensive O&amp;M specialist training and practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&amp;M clients with complex needs. Implications for rehabilitation Most orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) clients are travelling with a smartphone, so O&amp;M specialists need to be abreast of mainstream technologies, accessibility features and apps used by clients for orientation, mobility, visual efficiency and social engagement. O&amp;M specialists who are technology laggards need human-guided support to develop confidence in using travel technologies, and O&amp;M clients are the experts. COVID-19 has created an imperative to learn skills for O&amp;M tele-practice. Affordability is a significant barrier to O&amp;M professionals and clients accessing specialist travel technologies in Malaysia, and to O&amp;M professionals upgrading technology in Australia. Comprehensive training for O&amp;M specialists is needed in Malaysia to meet the travel needs of clients with low vision or blindness who also have physical, cognitive, sensory or mental health complications.","Deverell, Bhowmik, Lau, Al Mahmud, Sukunesan, Islam, McCarthy, Meyer","https://doi.org/10.1080/17483107.2020.1785565","20200709","Orientation and mobility; assistive technology; blind; electronic travel aids; low vision; smartphone; technology training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2637,""

"Caspase1/11 signaling affects muscle regeneration and recovery following ischemia, and can be modulated by chloroquine","We previously showed that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases inflammatory cleaved caspase-1 activity in myocytes, and that caspase-1/11 is protective in sterile liver injury. However, the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ. C57Bl/6Ã¢â‚¬â€°J (WT) and caspase-1/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-limb ischemia) with or without CQ (50Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/kg IP every 2nd day). CQ effects on autophagosome formation, microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and caspase-1 expression was measured using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging documented perfusion every 7Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. After 21Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, in situ physiologic testing in tibialis anterior muscle assessed peak force contraction, and myocyte size and fibrosis was also measured. Muscle satellite cell (MuSC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate was measured. Caspase-1 and glycolytic enzyme expression was detected by Western blot. CQ increased autophagosomes, LC3 consolidation, total caspase-1 expression and cleaved caspase-1 in muscle. Perfusion, fibrosis, myofiber regeneration, muscle contraction, MuSC fusion, OCR, ECAR and glycolytic enzyme expression was variably affected by CQ depending on presence of caspase-1/11. CQ decreased perfusion recovery, fibrosis and myofiber size in WT but not caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ diminished peak force in whole muscle, and myocyte fusion in MuSC and these effects were exacerbated in caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ reductions in maximal respiration and ATP production were reduced in caspase-1/11KO mice. Caspase-1/11KO MuSC had significant increases in protein kinase isoforms and aldolase with decreased ECAR. Caspase-1/11 signaling affects the response to ischemia in muscle and effects are variably modulated by CQ. This may be critically important for disease treated with CQ and its derivatives, including novel viral diseases (e.g. COVID-19) that are expected to affect patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease.","Sachdev, Ferrari, Cui, Pius, Sahu, Reynolds, Liao, Sun, Shinde, Ambrosio, Shiva, Loughran, Scott","https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-020-00190-2","20200709","Autophagy; Glycolysis; Inflammasome; Ischemic muscle; Lysosomal inhibition; Oxidative phosphorylation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2639,""
"How do Funeral Practices impact Bereaved Relatives' Mental Health, Grief and Bereavement? A Mixed Methods Review with Implications for COVID-19","Those who are bereaved during the current COVID-19 pandemic are subject to restrictions on funeral sizes and practices. We conducted a rapid review synthesising the quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes. Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, KSR Evidence, and COVID-related resources were conducted. 805 records were screened; 17 studies of variable quality were included. Current evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes is inconclusive. Five observational studies found benefits from funeral participation while six did not. However, qualitative research provides additional insight: the benefit of after-death rituals including funerals depends on the ability of the bereaved to shape those rituals and say goodbye in a way which is meaningful for them. Findings highlight the important role of funeral officiants during the pandemic. Research is needed to better understand the experiences and sequalae of grief and bereavement during COVID-19.","Burrell, Selman","https://doi.org/10.1177/0030222820941296","20200709","bereavement; burial; funerals; grief; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2640,""
"Global Storm of Stress-Related Psychopathological Symptoms: A Brief Overview on the Usefulness of Virtual Reality in Facing the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency requiring clinicians to be prepared to cope with the increase in the future incidence of trauma and stress-related psychopathological symptoms. The early detection of psychological distress and timely intervention are strongly recommended. Clinicians should also consider integrating new technologies such as virtual reality (VR) in the treatment of these trauma and stress-related psychopathological symptoms. Here we provide a brief overview of how VR can help to cope with the potential short-term and long-term mental health consequences related to this global emergency.","Imperatori, Dakanalis, Farina, Pallavicini, Colmegna, Mantovani, Clerici","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0339","20200709","COVID-19; PTSD; trauma and stress-related disorders; virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-10","",2641,""
