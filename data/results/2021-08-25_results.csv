"COVID-19 mitigation measures in primary schools and association with infection and school staff wellbeing: an observational survey linked with routine data in Wales, UK","Abstract Introduction School-based COVID-19 mitigation strategies have greatly impacted the primary school day (children aged 3-11) including: wearing face coverings, 2-metre distancing, no mixing of children, and no breakfast clubs or extra-curricular activities. This study examines these mitigation methods and association with COVID-19 infection, respiratory infection, and school staff wellbeing between October to December 2020 in Wales, UK. Methods A school staff survey captured self-reported COVID-19 mitigation measures in the school, participant anxiety and depression, and open-text responses regarding experiences of teaching and implementing measures. These survey responses were linked to national-scale COVID-19 test results data to examine association of measures in the school and the likelihood of a positive (staff or pupil) COVID-19 case in the school (clustered by school, adjusted for school size and free school meals using logistic regression). Linkage was conducted through the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank. Results Responses were obtained from 353 participants from 59 primary schools within 15 of 22 local authorities. Having more direct non-household contacts was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 positive case in the school (1-5 contacts compared to none, OR 2.89 (1.01, 8.31)) and a trend to more self-reported cold symptoms. Staff face covering was not associated with a lower odds of school COVID-19 cases (mask vs. no covering OR 2.82 (1.11, 7.14)) and was associated with higher self-reported cold symptoms. School staff reported the impacts of wearing face coverings on teaching, including having to stand closer to pupils and raise their voices to be heard. 67.1% were not able to implement 2-metre social distancing from pupils. We did not find evidence that maintaining a 2-metre distance was associated with lower rates of COVID-19 in the school. Conclusions Implementing, adhering to and evaluating COVID-19 mitigation guidelines is challenging in primary school settings. Our findings suggest that reducing non-household direct contacts lowers infection rates. There was no evidence that face coverings, 2-metre social distancing or stopping children mixing was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 or cold infection rates in the school. Primary school staff found teaching challenging during COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger learners and those with additional learning needs.","Emily Marchant; Lucy Griffiths; Tom Crick; Richard Fry; Joe Hollinghurst; Michaela James; Laura Cowley; Hoda Abbasizanjani; Fatemeh Torabi; Dan Thompson; Jonathan Kennedy; Ashley Akbari; Michael Gravenor; Ronan A Lyons; Sinead Brophy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.20.21262349","20210824","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17348,""
"Closed Doors: Predictors of Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD During the Onset of COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic first reached Brazil in late February 2020. Since then, it is one of the most affected countries globally. The rise of mental health problems in the population directly or indirectly affected is now a major concern. In the present study, we show the results of the first wave of the COVIDPsiq cohort study, which started early on (April 2020). The aim of this study was to investigate and compare independent predictors of symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Brazilians one month after social distancing measures were implemented. Methods: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were the two self-report instruments used to assess the symptoms. Variables related to demographics, social distancing, exposure to the news of coronavirus pandemic, substance use, and traumatic situations were also analyzed. Data was gathered through a web-based survey. Multivariate analyses were performed through hierarchical multiple linear regression models (HMLR). Result: A sample of 3,587 participants completed the questionnaire, among which approximately two-thirds considered that their mental health worsened after the beginning of the social restriction measures. Stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD levels were highly correlated with this self-perception. The five most important predictors of psychological distress were the distress related to pandemic news, younger age, current psychiatric diagnosis, trouble sleeping, and emotional abuse or violence. Limitations: This is an internet survey-based study in which convenience sample bias may limit its external validity. It does not represent the northern regions of the country and most participants are white wealthier females. It was not possible to evaluate if symptoms are clinically relevant to infer an increased incidence of mental illness. Conclusions: These results confirm the hypothesis that a pandemic would have important impacts on the mental health of the population and indicate the level of distress related to the media as an important predictor of mental symptoms.","Vitor Crestani Calegaro; Luis F Ramos-Lima; Mauricio Scopel Hoffmann; Gustavo Zoratto; Natalia Kerber; Fernanda C Dala Costa; Vitor Daniel Picinin; Julia Kochler; Leonardo Rodrigues; Luisa Maciel; Luiza Elizabete Braun; Fernando Leite Girardi; Gabriel O Cecatto; Leopoldo Pompeo Weber; Bruna Fragoso Rodrigues; Alessandra N Bertolazi; Juliana Motta de Oliveira; Bianca Lorenzi Negretto; Andrea Feijo de Mello","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.18.21262061","20210824","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17349,""
"Psychosocial situation, adherence, and utilization of video consultation in young adult long-term pediatric liver transplant recipients during COVID-19 pandemic","Young adults who underwent liver transplantation in childhood (YALTs) are highly vulnerable to non-adherent behavior and psychosocial problems. During the COVID-19 pandemic, special efforts may be necessary to maintain contact with these patients and offer support. This can be achieved through the use of telemedicine. The study's objective was to assess adherence and the psychosocial situation of YALTs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and to evaluate the utilization of video consultations. In May 2020, a questionnaire was sent to YALTs treated at the Hamburg University Transplant Center, accompanied by the offer of video appointments with the attending physician. The questionnaire included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7, the Patient Health Questionnaire 2, and questions compiled by the authors. Of 98 YALTs, 12% used the video consultation, while 65% had an in-person appointment. The 56 patients who completed the questionnaire did not report reduced medication adherence during the pandemic, but 40% missed follow-up visits with their primary care physician or check-up laboratory tests. About 70% of YALTs were afraid to visit their physician and the transplant center, and 34% were afraid of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mental health and well-being were unimpaired. During the COVID-19 pandemic, YALTs in our study did not show an increased need for psychosocial support, but a majority were afraid to attend medical appointments, and 40% reported lower appointment adherence. Acceptance of video consultations was lower than expected. The reasons for this need to be further investigated in order to optimize care.","KrÃƒÂ¶ncke, Lund, Buchholz, Lang, Briem-Richter, Grabhorn, Sterneck","https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.14121","20210824","COVID-19; adherence; adolescents; liver transplantation; psychosocial; video consultation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17350,""
"Epilepsy care during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the care of all patients around the world. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) COVID-19 and Telemedicine Task Forces examined, through surveys to people with epilepsy (PWE), caregivers, and health care professionals, how the pandemic has affected the well-being, care, and services for PWE. The ILAE included a link on their website whereby PWE and/or their caregivers could fill out a survey (in 11Ã‚Â languages) about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including access to health services and impact on mental health, including the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. An anonymous link was also provided whereby health care providers could report cases of new-onset seizures or an exacerbation of seizures in the context of COVID-19. Finally, a separate questionnaire aimed at exploring the utilization of telehealth by health care professionals since the pandemic began was available on the ILAE website and also disseminated to its members. Seventeen case reports were received; data were limited and therefore no firm conclusions could be drawn. Of 590 respondents to the well-being survey (422 PWE, 166 caregivers), 22.8% PWE and 27.5% caregivers reported an increase in seizure frequency, with difficulty in accessing medication and health care professionals reported as barriers to care. Of all respondents, 57.1% PWE and 21.5% caregivers had severe psychological distress (k score &gt;13), which was significantly higher among PWE than caregivers (p&lt;0.01). An increase in telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by health care professionals, with 40% of consultations conducted by this method. Although 74.9% of health care providers thought that this impacted positively, barriers to care were also identified. As we move forward, there is a need to ensure ongoing support and care for PWE to prevent a parallel pandemic of unmet health care needs.","Cross, Kwon, Asadi-Pooya, Balagura, GÃƒÂ³mez-Iglesias, Guekht, Hall, Ikeda, Kishk, Murphy, Kissani, Naji, Perucca, PÃƒÂ©rez-Poveda, Sanya, Trinka, Zhou, Wiebe, Jette","https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17045","20210824","COVID-19; people with epilepsy; psychological distress; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17351,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of presentations of penetrating injuries to a UK major trauma centre","Knife-related violence is of growing concern in the UK. This study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency of penetrating injuries at a UK major trauma centre. This was a retrospective study comparing the number of patients attending the emergency department of King's College Hospital (KCH) with a penetrating injury (gunshot or stab wound) during the 'pandemic year' (1 March 2020-28 February 2021) compared with the equivalent time period in the previous year. Penetrating injuries as a result of self-harm were excluded. The primary outcome was to assess whether there were any changes to the frequency of presentations during three periods of national lockdowns. Lockdown 1 showed a 48.45% reduction in presentations in the 'pandemic year' compared to the previous year, lockdown 2 showed a 31.25% reduction; however, lockdown 3 showed an 8.89% increase in the number of presentations. Our findings suggest that despite the initial reduction in the number of presentations of penetrating injury during lockdown 1, this returned to normal levels by lockdown 3. Further research is required to understand the effects of government-imposed restrictions on interpersonal violence and identify appropriate methods of outreach prevention during a pandemic.","Hickland, Massouh, Sutthakorn, Greenslade, Jennings, Cantle, Bew","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab333","20210824","emergency care; public health; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17352,""
"Work-life balance amongst dental professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic-A structural equation modelling approach","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019, has shocked the entire world. As an effort to control the disease spread, the Indian government declared a nationwide lockdown on March 25th, 2020. As dental treatment was considered high risk in the spread of COVID-19, dentistry became one of the most vulnerable professions during this time. Dental professionals had to face job layoffs, salary cuts in professional colleges, closure of private clinics resulting in huge psychological, moral, and financial crises. Studies during the previous and present pandemics have shown mental issues among health care workers necessitating institutional reforms, along with early care and support. A balance in the work-life amongst professionals is the key to better efficiency and, was majorly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown due to sudden unexpected changes. Hence this study was conducted to understand the changes they underwent both at home and professional front with a hypothesis that physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influence the work-life balance. A pre-validated questionnaire survey was done on dentists across India. Structural Equation Modelling and path analysis were applied to the data collected. The results of the study supported the hypothesis that factors like physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influenced the work-life balance directly. A significant imbalance was seen amongst the female dentists. The present study proved the unpreparedness among dental professionals. Hence an evolutionary phase in every field with better working protocols, robust mental health support, and a focus on strategies to face future such emergencies is required.","Pai, Patil, Kamath, Mahendra, Singhal, Bhat","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256663","20210824","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17353,""
"COVID-19 and Children's Well-Being: A Rapid Research Agenda","Understanding the full impact of COVID-19 on U.S. children, families, and communities is critical to (a) document the scope of the problem, (b) identify solutions to mitigate harm, and (c) build more resilient response systems. We sought to develop a research agenda to understand the short- and long-term mechanisms and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's healthy development, with the goal of devising and ultimately testing interventions to respond to urgent needs and prepare for future pandemics. The Life Course Intervention Research Network facilitated a series of virtual meetings that included members of 10 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) research programs, their research and implementation partners, as well as family and community representatives, to develop an MCH COVID-19 Research Agenda. Stakeholders from academia, clinical practice, nonprofit organizations, and family advocates participated in four meetings, with 30-35 participants at each meeting. Investigating the impacts of COVID-19 on children's mental health and ways to address them emerged as the highest research priority, followed by studying resilience at individual and community levels; identifying and mitigating the disparate negative effects of the pandemic on children and families of color, prioritizing community-based research partnerships, and strengthening local, state and national measurement systems to monitor children's well-being during a national crisis. Enacting this research agenda will require engaging the community, especially youth, as equal partners in research co-design processes; centering anti-racist perspectives; adopting a ""strengths-based"" approach; and integrating young researchers who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). New collaborative funding models and investments in data infrastructure are also needed.","Dudovitz, Russ, Berghaus, Iruka, DiBari, Foney, Kogan, Halfon","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03207-2","20210824","COVID-19; Child; Health equity; Mental health; Research co-design","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17354,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Urology Residents: a Narrative Review","The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges for urology resident education. In this review, we discuss the pandemic's impact on urology trainees and their education. Urology trainees were often redeployed to frontline services in unfamiliar clinical settings. Residents often experienced increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Many programs instituted virtual ""check-ins"" and formed liaisons with mental health services to foster cohesiveness. Urology trainees experienced the integration of telehealth into the clinical realm. Virtual surgery lectures and simulations were utilized to augment surgical education. Academic governing bodies upheld resident protections and provided dynamic guidance for training requirement throughout the pandemic. Medical students were unable to participate in traditional in-person away rotations and interviews, complicating the residency application process. The COVID-19 pandemic shook the healthcare system and ushered in seismic changes for urology trainees worldwide. Though the longstanding effects of the pandemic remain to be seen, urology residents have demonstrated tremendous resilience and bravery throughout this challenging period, and those qualities will undeniably withstand the test of time.","Khusid, Kashani, Fink, Weinstein, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-021-01063-9","20210824","COVID-19; Education; Graduate Medical Education; Internship and residency; Pandemic; Urology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17355,""
"Self-reported Mental and Physical Health Among Norwegian Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting conditions may negatively affect adolescents. To examine aspects of self-reported mental and physical health among adolescents in Norway before and during the pandemic, including the role of pandemic-associated anxiety. This cohort study examined a diverse nationwide sample of grade 11 students from the longitudinal MyLife study in Norway. The original study recruitment of all 8th, 9th, and 10th graders from the same middle schools facilitated identification of 2 sociodemographically comparable cohorts assessed in October to December 2018 and 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and October to December 2020, during the pandemic. School entry and enrollment in Norway is determined by the birth year, and students usually start high school (11th grade) during the fall of the year of their 16th birthday. Data were analyzed from March to June 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated conditions in Norway. In grades 10 and 11, adolescents reported their depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cutoff scores for moderate/severe depression, Ã¢â€°Â¥15), number of close friends, physical health, and organized sports participation. Cohort differences were examined with a set of nested regression models, incrementally controlling for sociodemographic covariates and grade 10 outcomes. A sample of 2536 adolescents (1505 [59.4%] girls) was analyzed, including 1621 adolescents before the pandemic and 915 adolescents during the pandemic, of whom 158 adolescents (17.3%) reported high pandemic anxiety. The only significant difference in outcomes between the COVID-19 cohort and the pre-COVID-19 cohort were lower odds of organized sports participation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87). However, in subanalyses comparing adolescents with high anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic with adolescents in the pre-COVID-19 cohort, adolescents with high pandemic anxiety were more likely to experience clinical-level depression symptoms (aOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.39-3.37) and poor physical health (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.31). In this cohort study of Norwegian adolescents, adolescents who started high school during the pandemic year had lower odds of organized sports participation in late 2020, but were otherwise comparable in terms of self-reported mental and physical health with their pre-COVID-19 counterparts. However, adolescents in the COVID-19 cohort experiencing high pandemic-related anxiety had significantly greater odds of poorer mental and physical health than adolescents in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Strategies aiming to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may benefit from identifying youth disproportionally affected by the pandemic conditions.","Burdzovic Andreas, Brunborg","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.21934","20210824","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17356,""

"Return to Activity After SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Cardiac Clearance for Children and Adolescents","Sedentary behavior and inability to participate in organized physical activity has negatively affected the physical and mental health of children and adolescents; however, cardiac injury and associated risk for sudden cardiac death with return to activity remains a major concern. Guidelines have been proposed for return to activities; however, these fail to address the needs of younger children and those participating in more casual activities. Guidance is needed for primary care providers to facilitate safe return to everyday activity and sports and to help direct appropriate laboratory, electrocardiographic, and anatomical assessment. Review of computerized databases of available literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and postinfection sequelae, risk factors for sudden cardiac death, and previous return to play recommendations.

In this report, we review the literature on return to activity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose recommendations for cardiac clearance for children and adolescents. Though severe disease and cardiac injury is less common in children than in adults, it can occur. Several diagnostic modalities such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and serologic testing may be useful in the cardiac evaluation of children after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gradual return to activity is possible in most children and adolescents after SARS-CoV-2 infection and many of these patients can be cleared by their primary care providers.

"Psychological impacts during the COVID-19 outbreak among adult population in Jordan: A cross-sectional study","In response to the initial outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the pandemic-related restraints and preventive measures implemented, the global population has been experiencing a wide range of immediate psychological reactions, such as fear and psychological distress. The present study aimed to assess the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of adults during the national lockdown implemented in Jordan. A quantitative, descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional design was used. An anonymous online questionnaire was used to collect data on the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, the changes in daily life they had experienced, their fear of COVID-19, and their depression, anxiety, and stress levels. A total of 725 Jordanian adults aged 18-65 years (mean = 33.7, SD = 9.3) were included in this study, with most of the participants being female (n = 409, 56.4%). The majority of the participants reported changes in their daily routines and activities during the COVID-19 lockdown, with 62.8% of the participants reporting weight changes, 92% reporting increased social media use, and 86.5% reporting increased mobile phone use and checking. Further, 41.4% of the participants reported high levels of fear of COVID-19, while 41.8%, 24.5%, and 22.8% reported mild to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Female participants had significantly higher levels of fear of COVID-19 and stress than did males. Fear of COVID-19 was significantly positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress scores. Anxiety, stress, gender, having physical disorders, and having mental disorders were identified as being significant predictive factors of fear of COVID-19. The findings of this study highlight the urgent need to pay further attention towards maintaining the psychological well-being of the public during this global crisis. The findings may guide the development of appropriate public health strategies aimed at promoting healthy living, improving mental health, and reducing fear and other psychological problems among at-risk groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Relations between anxiety sensitivity's cognitive concerns and anxiety severity: brooding and reflection as serial multiple mediators","The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a major impact on productivity and life functioning, and also led to adverse emotional reactions. In the face of this public health event, increased anxiety is one of the most common emotional reactions. Previous studies have shown that anxiety sensitivity, rumination and anxiety are closely related. Various dimensions of anxiety sensitivity have different effects on anxiety. Also, rumination can be divided into brooding and reflection. To explore the relationships among anxiety sensitivity's cognitive concerns, anxiety and different types of rumination, we conducted an online survey during the outbreak of coronavirus (February 17-25, 2020), using the Anxiety Sensitivity Scale-3 (ASI-3), Ruminative Responses Scale (RSS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The results showed significant positive correlations among anxiety sensitivity's cognitive concerns, anxiety, brooding and reflection. Furthermore, brooding and reflection had a chain mediation effect between cognitive concerns and anxiety, and the mediation effect of reflection was even stronger. Results suggest that anxiety sensitivity's cognitive concerns may not only affect anxiety directly, but also affect anxiety through rumination, especially reflection.","Yang, Zhao, Fang, Elhai","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02195-4","20210824","Anxiety; Anxiety sensitivity; Covid-19; Multiple mediation; Rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17361,""
"Nurses' experiences of caring for people with COVID-19 in Hong Kong: a qualitative enquiry","Nurses are the largest group of healthcare workers on the front line of efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. An understanding of their nursing experiences, the challenges they encountered and the strategies they used to address them may inform efforts to better prepare and support nurses and public health measures when facing a resurgence of COVID-19 or new pandemics. This study aimed to explore the experiences of nurses caring for people with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 in Hong Kong. A qualitative study was conducted using individual, semistructured interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Participants were recruited from acute hospitals and a public health department in Hong Kong from June 2020 to August 2020. A purposive sample of registered nurses (N=39) caring for people with COVID-19 in Hong Kong were recruited. Two-thirds of the nurses had a master's degree and over a third had 6-10 years of nursing experience. Around 40% of the nurses cared for people with COVID-19 in isolation wards and a quarter performed COVID-19-related work for 31-40 hours/week. Most (90%) had training in COVID-19 and three-quarters had experience of working in infection control teams. Six key themes emerged: confronting resource shortages; changes in usual nursing responsibilities and care modes; maintaining physical and mental health; need for effective and timely responses from relevant local authorities; role of the community in public health protection and management; and advanced pandemic preparedness. Our study found that nurses possessed resilience, self-care and adaptability when confronting resource shortages, changing nursing protocols, and physical and mental health threats during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, coordinated support from the clinical environment, local authorities and community, and advanced preparedness would likely improve nursing responses to future pandemics.","Chau, Lo, Saran, Leung, Lam, Thompson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052683","20210824","COVID-19; infection control; public health; qualitative research; quality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17362,""
"Paradoxical effects of cigarette smoke and COPD on SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease","How cigarette smoke (CS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection and severity is controversial. We investigated the effects of COPD and CS on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in vivo in COPD patients and controls and in CS-exposed mice, and the effects of CS on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. We quantified: (1) pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA, and both ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR in two independent human cohorts; and (2) pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA in C57BL/6 WT mice exposed to air or CS for up to 6Ã‚Â months. The effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated after in vitro infection of Calu-3 cells and differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), respectively. ACE2 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in peripheral airways from COPD patients versus controls but similar in central airways. Mice exposed to CS had decreased ACE2 protein levels in their bronchial and alveolar epithelia versus air-exposed mice. CS treatment decreased viral replication in Calu-3 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence staining for replicative double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and western blot for viral N protein. Acute CS exposure decreased in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication in HBECs, as determined by plaque assay and RT-qPCR. ACE2 levels were decreased in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells from COPD patients versus controls, and from CS-exposed versus air-exposed mice. CS-pre-exposure potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. These findings urge to investigate further the controversial effects of CS and COPD on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tomchaney, Contoli, Mayo, Baraldo, Li, Cabel, Bull, Lick, Malo, Knoper, Kim, Tram, Rojas-Quintero, Kraft, Ledford, Tesfaigzi, Martinez, Thorne, Kheradmand, Campos, Papi, Polverino","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-021-01639-8","20210824","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17363,""
"Exploring the beliefs and perceptions of spending time in nature among US youth","The prevalence of poor mental health continues to rise among youth; however, large-scale interventions to improve mental and physical health remain a public health challenge. Time spent in nature is associated with improved health among youth. This study aimed to assess youth experiences with nature and the self-perceived impact on their mental and physical health among a nationwide sample of US youth. In September 2020, five open-ended questions that aimed to assess perceptions regarding nature were posed to 1174 MyVoice youth, aged 14-24Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic analysis, and data were summarized using descriptive statistics. The mean (SD) age of the 994 respondents (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°84.7%) was 18.9 (2.7) years; 47.4% were female, and 57.4% Non-Hispanic White. Among youth, many felt that spending time in nature positively impacted their mental health, with 51.6% mentioning that it made them ""feel calm when I am out in nature""; 22.1% said that it relieved stress or ""reduces my anxiety,"" and 17.1% felt that being in nature positively impacted their physical health and ""makes me feel more active and in shape."" However, 7.0% said it negatively impacted their health, such as ""It makes me feel isolated."" Most youth (87.8%) want to spend more time in nature, with 22% mentioning barriers (i.e., busy schedules, built environment, and COVID-19) impeding them from doing so. Youth in our sample generally report feeling physically and mentally better when spending time in nature and want to spend more time in nature. Public health policies and practices that eliminate barriers and actively support time spent outside may be a feasible and acceptable practice to promote overall well-being among youth.","Zamora, Waselewski, Frank, Nawrocki, Hanson, Chang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11622-x","20210824","Adolescent; Mental health; Nature; Physical health; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17364,""
"COVID-19 and mental health: Anxiety disorders among immigrants due to COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected various facets of health. While mental health became a major concern during the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact on the migrants' mental health has still been neglected. The purpose of this study was to examine the COVID-19 outbreak's impact on the mental health of immigrants in South Korea. A total number of 386 immigrants in South Korea participated in this quantitative cross-sectional study. The standardized e-questionnaire, including the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, was used to measure the anxiety level. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find out the determinants of anxiety disorders among immigrants. The prevalence of severe anxiety among immigrants was found to be 47.2%. Female immigrants (28.6%) had a lower anxiety disorder than males (71.4%). Immigrants who were married, living alone, had a low income, had a history of health problems were suffered from moderate to severe anxiety. Immigrants who were unemployed (OR 2.302, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.353-3.917) and lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 outbreak (OR 2.197, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.312-3.678) have a higher anxiety disorder. Immigrants aged over 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years were found to suffer from a high level of anxiety (OR 2.285, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.184-4.410). Relief support from the government was significantly associated with anxiety disorder among immigrants (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.151, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.962-5.061). With very limited studies on immigrants' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper provides scientific research evidence of the COVID-19 outbreak's impact on the mental health of migrants. Our study has consequences for implementing integrated psychological interventions and health promotion strategies for the well-being of immigrants' mental health.","Acharya, Moon, Chun, Shin","https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174211042695","20210824","COVID-19; anxiety disorder; mental health; migrant health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-25","",17365,""
