"COVID-19 Viral Loads, Environment, Ventilation, Masks, Exposure Time, And Severity : A Pragmatic Guide Of Estimates","This study helps answer the question ""How long may a person safely remain within a given environment and what is the associated risk relative to other environments"". Understanding how COVID-19 infection likelihood, symptom severity, and immune response correlate to aerosolized viral load concentration exposure levels and time durations could enable optimized Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) that reduce severe case counts and improve at-large epidemiologic responses. The model herein estimates the relationships between aerosolized viral load concentrations present in a given environment containing infected persons, the exposure time duration, ventilation, mask usage, exercise / activity level, and likelihood of infection, severity level, and immune response. This study references peer reviewed and published studies and uses them as data sources. Measured aerosolized viral load concentration data from a hospital environment is used to estimate exposure time durations associated with exposures at multiple viral load levels, within multiple indoor ventilation and outdoor environment scenarios, with the exposed subject respirating at both light activity and heavy exercise liter-per-minute volumes, and without and without wearing surgical masks. Information from ASHRAE Office Ventilation standards and an Outdoor Air Exchange model are a part of the model. This estimated total viral load accumulated within specific exposure time durations in the various environmental scenarios is then interpreted using human challenge viral load escalation data into severity categories including Not Ill, Minor Illness, Clinical Mild Illness, and Possible Severe Illness. Immune response data related to these categories is also provided. When appropriately interpreted for individualized applications, the estimates herein could contribute to guidance for those at low-risk for a severe case that have no obvious COVID-19 co-morbidities, with the understanding that those at higher risk should seek to avoid all exposure risk. The estimates herein may help efforts to strike a balance in developing holistic epidemiologic interventions that consider the effects of these interventions on economic, civic, social, and mental health, which have pathologies within their own realms.","David E.

"COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LEVEL OF SITUATIONAL AND PERSONAL ANXIETY OF MEDICAL WORKERS AND OTHER POPULATION GROUPS IN A PANDEMIC OF A NEW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION - COVID-19","During a pandemic, threats and risks to people's mental health are growing  However, to date, there is insufficient scientific data on the characteristics of the emotional sphere and attitude to the changing living conditions of various population groups  The data on anxiety, depressive conditions in the context of a new coronavirus infection are especially relevant for providing timely psychological assistance to medical workers, both working directly with the infected and not directly interacting with them  The paper describes and presents the results of online monitoring of the manifestations of anxiety and persistent emotional states in medical workers who are not at the forefront with Covid-19 patients and other populations in the context of the coronavirus pandemic  102 people took part in the monitoring (the average age of the subjects was 38 91Â±11 07 (from 23 years to 70 years), 32 men, 70 women  According to the results of the survey of four groups: medical workers who do not directly interact with patients with Covid-19 (group I, n = 55 people), who work in other areas (group II, n = 47 people), it is determined that the highest level of stress is in the groups of medical workers and residents receiving higher professional medical education (the results are statistically significant, the significance level is p = 0,01)  At the time of the examination, these subjects expressed relatively stable individual experiences of the anxiety-depressive complex  They experience anxiety, are prone to fears, and experience psycho-emotional stress  The study allows us to attribute to the risk group not only medical workers directly working with patients, but also medical workers who do not directly interact with them, and also confirms the need for timely clinical and psychological assistance to these groups  <U+0412><U+043E> <U+0432><U+0440><U+0435><U+043C><U+044F> <U+043F><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0435><U+043C><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0443><U+0442>

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health-Related Concerns, Quality of Life and Psychological Adjustment in Young Adults with Congenital Heart Disease","Background: The risk for a severe disease course in case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in young adults with congenital heart disease is largely unknown, potentially leading to uncertainty and anxiety among affected patients  This study aims to investigate health-related concerns, health-related quality of life and psychological adjustment in patients with congenital heart disease compared to healthy peers during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods: One-hundred patients with congenital heart disease and 50 controls (M = 29 7, SD = 3 8 years) were recruited  They completed an online survey including the assessment of health-related concerns regarding COVID-19, the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and the Brief Symptom Inventory  Results: Patients considered COVID-19 to be a more serious issue (Generalized odds ratio [GenOR] = 1 67, p = 0 04), were more concerned about becoming infected (GenOR = 2 93, p &lt; 0 001) and expressed more fear about leaving their homes (GenOR = 1 81, p = 0 004) while general anxiety symptoms were not different between groups (p = 0 23)  Patients relied more on family and friends for support (30% vs  2% in controls, p &lt; 0 001) and reported better compliance with protective measures (p = 0 03)  Mental health-related quality of life and psychological adjustment were not different between groups (p = 0 17 and p = 0 68, respectively)  Physical health-related quality of life was lower in patients compared to controls (p = 0 03)  Conclusions: Young adults with congenital heart disease in Switzerland are more concerned about their health during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to healthy peers  These concerns, however, do not translate into generally impaired mental wellbeing  The impact of the easing of lockdown measures on long-term anxiety levels and quality of life requires further study","Wehrle, Flavia M.; Landolt, Markus A.; Latal, Beatrice; Rometsch, Sarah; Greutmann, Matthias","https://doi.org/10.32604/chd.2020.013078","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Congenital Heart Disease;15(5):301-308, 2020.; Publication details: Congenital Heart Disease;15(5):301-308, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-16","",6054,""
"Would the lock-down induced economic contraction be a prelude to a major depression?","The coronavirus or Covid-19 epidemic has stricken the imagination  The fear of a total collapse of advanced countries health system gave birth to what has been called the lock-down of major economies  These measures also have a cost  Obviously, the longer would the lock-down situation go, the higher its economic cost  But, at some point, we could have some irreversible consequences as the number of Small or Very Small enterprises going bankrupt could reach a critical mass  One could then ask the question to know if the health emergency linked to epidemic is not paving the way to major an economic crisis, one that could dwarf all other post-1945 crises  The end of the containment is not to simply jump-start the economy  The level of depression experienced during the lock-down situation would be a serious indicator to estimate the duration of the return to a pre-Covid situation  The difficulty in initially estimating the extent of this crisis can be understood  However, various governments clearly underestimated the gravity of the situation, like the French and the Italian ones, until the beginning of April 2020  They also continue for some, like the French government, to underestimate the extent of the recession  We have attempted in this text to produce realistic estimates and in the subsequent paper we are comparing our estimates with others, be they produced by public bodies or by private ones  If the drop in production figures is actually closer to the level of the 1929 crisis, what is new is the speed with which production is almost at a standstill  As with the 1929 depression the number of changes, for the better or for the worse, is to be extremely important","Sapir, Jacques","https://doi.org/10.31857/s042473880010521-2","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Economics and Mathematical Methods;56(3):5-25, 2020.; Publication details: Economics and Mathematical Methods;56(3):5-25, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-16","",6055,""

"Teaching During a Pandemic: A Model for Trauma-Informed Education and Administration","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) realities have demanded that educators move swiftly to adopt new ways of teaching, advising, and mentoring  We suggest the centering of a trauma-informed approach to education and academic administration during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration?s (SAMHSA) guidance on trauma-informed approaches to care  In our model for trauma-informed education and administration (M-TIEA), SAMHSA?s four key organizational assumptions are foundational, including a realization about trauma and its wide-ranging effects;a recognition of the basic signs and symptoms of trauma;a response that involves fully integrating knowledge into programs, policies, and practices;and an active process for resisting retraumatization  Since educators during the pandemic must follow new restrictions regarding how they teach, we have expanded the practice of teaching in M-TIEA to include both academic administrators? decision making about teaching, and educators? planning and implementation of teaching  In M-TIEA, SAMHSA?s six guiding principles for a trauma-informed approach are infused into these two interrelated teaching processes, and include the following: safety;trustworthiness and transparency;peer support;collaboration and mutuality;empowerment, voice, and choice;and cultural, historical, and gender issues  M-TIEA?s organizational assumptions, processes, and principles are situated within an outer context that acknowledges the potential influences of four types of intersectional traumas and stressors that may occur at multiple socioecological levels: pandemic-related trauma and stressors;other forms of individual, group, community, or mass trauma and stressors;historical trauma;and current general life stressors  This acknowledges that all trauma-informed work is dynamic and may be influenced by contextual factors","Harper, Gary W.; Neubauer, Leah C.","https://doi.org/10.1177/2373379920965596","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Pedagogy in Health Promotion;2020.; Publication details: Pedagogy in Health Promotion;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-16","",6067,""

"VULNERABILITY OF THE POPULATION OF MOSCOW DISTRICTS TO NATURAL HAZARDS","The frequency of natural hazards, such as heat waves, epidemics, floods, hurricanes etc  tends to increase both in Russia and abroad  Under the climate change, population aging and accelerating mobi lity, increased urban density and environment degradation the residents of large cities are becoming more vulnerable to the consequences of such events  According to experts, more than 11 thousand people be came victims of 2010 extreme summer temperatures in Moscow  The effects of the coronavirus epidemic are y et to be assessed, and it is important to study the socio-economic differences of Moscow districts in t he context of crisis and expanding pandemic, considering the negative consequences for health and life of residents  The authors propose a natural hazard vulnerability index for Moscow districts  The index accounts for the proportion of the most susceptible part of the population, as well as the possibility of ada ptation of residents  Such social strata as pensioners, disabled persons, residents of poorer areas and migr ants are the most vulnerable, i e  incapable of self-protection or leaving a disaster area because of physica l or financial restrictions  It was found that since 2010 the vulnerability of population has increased i n 104 of 125 Moscow districts, as a result of increasing numbers of elderly and disabled people, and decreasi ng incomes in the depressed areas  Priority territories for implementing the policy of adaptation to ha zardous events are in Zelenograd (Matushkino, Savelki, Staroe Kryukovo, Kryukovo, Silino), in the southeast (Nekrasovka, Veshnyaki) and the northeast (Northern Izmailovo, Metrogorodok, Golyanovo) parts of the capital  The adaptability in central districts, subjected to gentrification, is increasing due to th e growing proportion of wealthy citizens  As a result of the 2020 crisis, associated with the pandemic and the fall in oil prices, a decrease in household incomes could further aggravate the vulnerability of residents of the majority of Moscow districts;the most negative consequences are expected in more vulnerable areas  The results allow m ore precise application of natural hazards monitoring, warning and adaptation tools  For example, the ab ove- mentioned vulnerable areas are in need of providing the timely ambulance access and raising awarenes s of the elderly locals and migrants  <U+0412> <U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0438> <U+0437><U+0430>
