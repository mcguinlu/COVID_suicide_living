"An Emotion Care Model using Multimodal Textual Analysis on COVID-19","At the dawn of the year 2020, the world was hit by a significant pandemic COVID-19, that traumatized the entire planet  The infectious spread grew in leaps and bounds and forced the policymakers and governments to move towards lockdown  The lockdown further compelled people to stay under house arrest, which further resulted in an outbreak of emotions on social media platforms  Perceiving people's emotional state during these times becomes critically and strategically important for the government and the policymakers  In this regard, a novel emotion care scheme has been proposed in this paper to analyze multimodal textual data contained in real-time tweets related to COVID-19  Moreover, this paper studies 8-scale emotions (Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, and Trust) over multiple categories such as nature, lockdown, health, education, market, and politics  This is the first of its kind linguistic analysis on multiple modes pertaining to the pandemic to the best of our understanding  Taking India as a case study, we inferred from this textual analysis that â€˜joyâ€™ has been lesser towards everything (~9-15%) but nature (~17%) due to the apparent fact of lessened pollution  The education system entailed more trust (~29%) due to teachers' fraternity's consistent efforts  The health sector witnessed sadness (~16%) and fear (~18%) as the dominant emotions among the masses as human lives were at stake  Additionally, the state-wise and emotion-wise depiction is also provided  An interactive internet application has also been developed for the same","Gupta, Vedika, Jain, Nikita, Katariya, Piyush, Kumar, Adarsh, Mohan, Senthilkumar, Ahmadian, Ali, Ferrara, Massimiliano","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110708","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Chaos, Solitons & Fractals;144:110708, 2021.; Publication details: Chaos, Solitons & Fractals;144:110708, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",9964,""
"The effects of COVID-19 restrictions on physical activity and mental health of children and young adults with physical and/or intellectual disabilities","Background COVID-19 has caused unprecedented restrictions, significantly affecting the most vulnerable groups in society, such as those with a disability  Objective The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on physical activity and mental health of children and young adults with physical and/or intellectual disabilities  Methods The study was a cross-sectional design  Parents/carers completed an electronic survey in the UK between June-July 2020 on behalf of their child  Through Likert scales and free-text questions, the survey asked about physical activity levels and mental health during lockdown compared to before, access to specialist facilities and equipment to aid with physical activity, and the short- and long-term concerns around ongoing lockdown restrictions  Results Generally, respondents reported negative effects of lockdown restrictions, with 61% reporting a reduction in physical activity levels and over 90% reporting a negative impact on mental health (including poorer behaviour, mood, fitness and social and learning regression)  Many respondents cited a lack of access to specialist facilities, therapies and equipment as reasons for this, and raised concerns about the long-term effects of this lack of access on their childâ€™s mental health and physical activity levels  Conclusions The survey highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the physical activity levels and mental health of children and young adults with disabilities and highlights the importance of addressing the needs of the disabled community as restrictions are eased","Theis, Nicola, Campbell, Natalie, De Leeuw, Julie, Owen, Marie, Schenke, Kimberley C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101064","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Disability and Health Journal;: 101064, 2021.; Publication details: Disability and Health Journal;: 101064, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",9965,""
"Relationship between Physical and Mental Health Comorbidities and COVID-19 Positivity, Hospitalization, and Mortality","Background : Understanding the association between separate and combined mental and physical health diagnoses and COVID-19 outcomes is greatly needed to address the severity of illness  Methods : Data on 24,034 patients screened for COVID-19 as of July 2020 were extracted from the Froedtert/Medical College of Wisconsin Epic medical record  COVID-19 outcomes were defined as positive screens, proportion hospitalized among positive screens, and proportion that died among positive and hospitalized population  The primary independent variable was a 3-category variable: physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone, and combined mental and physical health diagnoses  Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the independent relationship between separate and combined diagnoses and COVID-19 outcomes  Results : Compared to physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0 68, CI=0 51;0 92) and was not associated with hospitalization or mortality among positive screens  Combined had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0 78, CI=0 69;0 88) and higher odds of hospitalization among positive screens after adjusting for demographics (OR=1 58, CI=1 20;2 08) but lost significance in the fully adjusted model  No category of diagnoses was associated with mortality  Limitations : Analysis is cross-sectional and cannot speak to any causal relationships  Conclusions : Overall, compared to physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis and combined had lower odds of positive screens  However, individuals with combined were more likely to be hospitalized, after adjusting for demographics only  These findings add new evidence for risk of COVID-19 and related hospitalization in individuals who have a physical and mental health diagnosis","Egede, Josh, Campbell, Jennifer A.; Walker, Rebekah J.; Garacci, Emma, Dawson, Aprill Z.; Egede, Leonard E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.048","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",9966,""

"Collision of Fundamental Human Rights and the Right to Health Access During the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic","Introduction: COVID-19 requires governmental measures to protect healthcare system access for people. In this process, the collision of fundamental rights emerges as a crucial challenge for decision-making. Policy Options and Implications: This policy review analyzes selected articles by the PubMed searcher about extreme measures taken in several countries during precedent pandemics and the current pandemic, and selects hard decisions relating to the exceptional measures taken by judicial departments in Brazil, connecting them to the ""collision of fundamental rights and law principles."" The collision of rights and principles imposed on decision makers a duty to provide balanced rights, and to adopt the enforcement of some rights prioritization. Ethical concerns were also verified in this field involving rights limitations. During a pandemic, the importance of extreme measures to protect health rights and healthcare systems is instrumental for focused, fast, and correct decision making to avoid loss of life and the collapse of healthcare systems. The main goals of this research are to discuss the implications and guidelines for public health decision making, the indispensable ethical and legal aspects for safeguarding health systems and the lives of people, and the respect of the Justice principle and of fundamental health and dignity rights. We conclude that COVID-19 justifies the prioritization of collective and individual health access rights. Acceptable standards of fundamental rights restrictions are established at the constitutional and international levels and must be enforced by rules and governmental action, to ensure fast and accurate decision making during a pandemic. Freedom rights exercises must be linked to solidarity for the realization of social welfare, for the health rights of all individuals and for health systems to function well during a pandemic. Actionable Recommendations: All individuals are free and equal, therefore social exclusion is prohibited. Institutions must consider social inequalities when discussing public health measures and be guided by ethical standards, by law principles, and rules recognized by constitutional and international law for the benefit of all during a health pandemic. Conclusions: Collective and individual health rights prevail over the collision of rights when facing pandemic occurrences, case by case, in health systems protection, based on the literature, on precedent pandemics and on legitimate Public Health efforts.","Dos Santos, JosÃ© Luiz Gondim; Stein Messetti, Paulo AndrÃ©; Adami, Fernando; Bezerra, Italla Maria Pinheiro; Maia, Paula Christianne G G Souto; Tristan-Cheever, Elisa; de Abreu, Luiz Carlos","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.570243","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Public Health;8: 570243, 2020.; Publication details: Front Public Health;8: 570243, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10002,""

"Mouse Model of SARS-CoV-2 Reveals Inflammatory Role of Type I Interferon Signaling","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has caused over 5,000,000 cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with significant fatality rate  Due to the urgency of this global pandemic, numerous therapeutic and vaccine trials have begun without customary safety and efficacy studies  Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of these types of studies;however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the inability of its spike (S) protein to engage the mouse ortholog of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)  While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis, these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background  Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2  These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models  Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses  Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds  This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19  Funding: This study was supported by awards from National Institute of Health grants, 2T32AI007517-16 (to BI), T32GM007205 and F30CA239444 (to ES), AI054359 and AI127429 (to AI), T32AI007019 (to TM),K08 AI128043 (to CBW), as well as Women's Health Research at Yale Pilot Project Program (AI, AR), Fast Grant from Emergent Ventures at the Mercatus Center (AI, ES), Mathers Foundation (AR, CBW, AI), and the Ludwig Family Foundation (AI, AR, CBW)  A I  is an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute  Conflict of Interest: None of the authors declare interests related to the manuscript  Ethical Approval: All procedures were performed in a BSL-3 facility (for SARS-CoV-2 infected mice) with approval from the Yale Environmental Health and Safety office","Israelow, B.; Song, E.; Mao, T.; Lu, P.; Meir, A.; Liu, F.; Alfajaro, M.

The extent of the effects, especially cumulative over the long period of the pandemic, has not yet been fully investigated for Germany. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine psychological burden as well as COVID-19-related experience and behavior patterns and to show how they changed during the different phases of the pandemic in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Germany-wide online-based cross-sectional study (03/10-07/27/2020) included 22,961 people (convenience sample). Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), and psychological distress (DT) were collected, as well as COVID-19-related experiences and behavior patterns: COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions, subjective level of information, adherent safety behavior, and personal risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness. The pandemic was retrospectively divided into fiveÂ phases (initial, crisis, lockdown, reorientation, and new normality). RESULTS: Compared to pre-COVID-19 reference values, GADÂ­7, PHQÂ­2, and DT levels were significantly elevated and persistent throughout the different phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-related fear, information level, trust, safety behavior, and the risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness showed, after initial strong increase, aÂ strong decrease to partly below the initial value. Exceptions were constant risk assessments of having aÂ severe course of illness or dying of it. CONCLUSIONS: The increased levels of psychological burden, which have persisted throughout all phases of the pandemic, illustrate the need for sustainable support services.

"Obsessive-compulsive disorder reinforcement during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is unquestionably impacting on the mental health of the population worldwide. Fear of contamination can both increase levels of stress in healthy individuals and intensify psychiatric symptoms in patients with pre-existing conditions, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the imminent risk of contamination creates a logical need for self-surveillance and hygiene habits. However, this kind of information can have drastic implications for subjects with OCD, since cognitive distortions and compensatory strategies (cleansing rituals) are no longer irrational or oversized - rather, these ideas become legitimate and socially accepted, generating plausible validation for the intensification of compulsive cleaning rituals. Patients who presented remission of OCD symptoms would be more likely to have a relapse, and subclinical patients may scale up and ultimately be diagnosed with OCD due to the reinforcement of their habits, emotions and thoughts.","Ornell, Braga, Bavaresco, Francke, Scherer, von Diemen, Kessler","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2020-0054","20210127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10010,""
"Cognitive and mental health changes and their vulnerability factors related to COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic and government imposed social restrictions like lockdown exposed most individuals to an unprecedented stress, increasing mental health disorders worldwide. We explored subjective cognitive functioning and mental health changes and their possible interplay related to COVID-19-lockdown. We also investigated potential risk factors to identify more vulnerable groups. Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions-with no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health. Frequent consumers of COVID-19 mass media information or residents in highly infected communities reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly hypochondria in the latter. If similar restrictions are reimposed, governments must carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decisions, whilst developing effective global and long-term responses to the cognitive and mental health challenges of this type of pandemic; as well as implementing appropriate psychological interventions with specific guidelines: particularly regarding exposure to COVID-19 mass-media reports.","Fiorenzato, Zabberoni, Costa, Cona","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246204","20210127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10011,""
"Using prosocial behavior to safeguard mental health and foster emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: A registered report protocol for a randomized trial","The COVID-19 pandemic, the accompanying lockdown measures, and their possible long-term effects have made mental health a pressing public health concern. Acts that focus on benefiting others-known as prosocial behaviors-offer one promising intervention that is both flexible and low cost. However, neither the range of emotional states prosocial acts impact nor the size of those effects is currently clear, both of which directly influence its attractiveness as a treatment option. Using a large online sample from Canada and the United States, we will examine the effect of a three-week prosocial intervention on two indicators of emotional well-being (happiness and the belief that one's life is valuable) and mental health (anxiety and depression). Respondents will be randomly assigned to perform prosocial, self-focused, or neutral behaviors each week. Two weeks after the intervention, a final survey will assess whether the intervention has a lasting effect on mental health and emotional well-being. Our results will illuminate whether prosocial interventions are a viable approach to addressing mental health needs during the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well for those who face emotional challenges during normal times.","Miles, Andiappan, Upenieks, Orfanidis","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245865","20210127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10012,""

At present, no method has characterized the mental health burden of the pandemic distinct from pre-COVID-19 levels. Accurate detection of illness is critical to facilitate pandemic-related treatment to prevent worsening symptoms. An algorithm for the isolation of pandemic-related concerns on a large digital mental health service is reported that utilized natural language processing (NLP) on unstructured therapy transcript data, in parallel with brief clinical assessments of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results demonstrate a significant increase in COVID-related intake anxiety symptoms, but no detectable difference in intake depression symptoms. Transcript analyses identified terms classifiable into 24 symptoms in excess of those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. Findings for this large digital therapy service suggest that treatment seekers are presenting with more severe intake anxiety levels than before the COVID-19 outbreak. Importantly, monitoring the symptoms identified in the study in addition to those for anxiety and depression is advised to fully capture the effects of COVID-19 on mental health.","Hull, Levine, Bantilan, Desai, Majumder","https://doi.org/10.2196/26190","20210127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10013,""

"Keeping well in a COVID-19 crisis: a qualitative study formulating the perspectives of mental health service users and carers","People with existing mental health conditions may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. But their positive and negative appraisals, and coping behaviour could prevent or ameliorate future problems. To explore the emotional experiences, thought processes and coping behaviours of people with existing mental health problems and carers living through the pandemic. UK participants who identified as a mental health service user (N18), a carer (N5) or both (N8) participated in 30-minute semi-structured remote interviews (31 March 2020 to 9 April 2020). The interviews investigated the effects of social distancing and self-isolation on mental health and the ways in which people were coping. Data were analysed using a framework analysis. Three service user researchers charted data into a framework matrix (consisting of three broad categories: &quot;emotional responses&quot;, &quot;thoughts&quot; and &quot;behaviours&quot;) and then used an inductive process to capture other contextual themes. Common emotional responses were fear, sadness and anger but despite negative emotions and uncertainty appraisals, participants described efforts to cope and maintain their mental wellbeing. This emphasised an increased reliance on technology, which enabled social contact and occupational or leisure activities. Participants also spoke about the importance of continued and adapted mental health service provision, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with changes in their living environment, life schedule and social interactions. This study builds on a growing number of qualitative accounts of how mental health service users and carers experienced and coped with extreme social distancing measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than a state of helplessness this study contains a clear message of resourcefulness and resilience in the context of fear and uncertainty.","Simblett, Wilson, Morris, Evans, Odoi, Mutepua, Dawe-Lane, Jilka, Pinfold, Wykes","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.1875424","20210127","COVID-19; coping; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10015,""

"Coping strategies and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown","COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures changed the everyday lives of people around the world. To evaluate the effects of different coping strategies on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. A representative sample for Austria was recruited through Qualtrics<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> in a period of 4 weeks after the lockdown started. Measurements were coping inventory (SCI), psychological quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF, psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). Regression analyses were performed with coping strategies as predictors and mental health measures as dependent variables. The representative sample included <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,005 respondents (52.7% women). Positive thinking, active stress coping and social support were found to be positive predictors for psychological life quality, well-being, and negative predictors for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

"Psychosocial and clinical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with childhood rheumatic diseases and their parents","This study aimed to evaluate the psychological symptoms of children and adolescents with rheumatological diseases (RD) and their parents during the outbreak. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional design in RD patients and healthy controls. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to evaluate parental psychiatric status; while the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Child was used for children. Four hundred and fifty-nine patients with RD and their parents completed the present study, as well as 336 healthy peers. The age and gender of the children were similar across groups. Under 12Ã‚Â years of age, the trait anxiety of the children and the psychological symptoms of parents were similar across groups; while over 13Ã‚Â years of age, anxiety and depression scores of the parents, as well as trait anxiety of the children were higher than the control groups' (7.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.4 vs 6.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.8, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006 for parental anxiety; 6.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.8 vs. 5.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.9, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001 for parental depression; 36.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.7 vs. 33.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.9, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002 for child trait anxiety). In patient group, there were no differences in scale scores according to variables such as rheumatological disease diagnosis, the consulting of doctor for treatment, thinking that RD increases the risk of COVID-19, the history of rheumatic disease attack during the pandemic process, and the use of biological agents. The children's trait anxiety was positively correlated with their parents' anxiety (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.414, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and depression (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.300, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) scores. These findings suggest that clinicians should pay attention to the psychiatric symptoms of both children with RD and their parents during the pandemic.","Durcan, Barut, Haslak, Doktur, Yildiz, Adrovic, Sahin, Kasapcopur","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04790-x","20210127","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Children; Depression; Outbreak; Rheumatic diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10018,""

"Understanding the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Transgender and Gender Nonbinary Individuals Engaged in a Longitudinal Cohort Study","While the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, no empiric US-based research has focused specifically on transgender and gender nonbinary (TGNB) people. We examined the pandemic's impact on an established longitudinal cohort of TGNB individuals (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 208) by administering an online survey between March-June 2020. We used multivariable linear regression to examine reduced LGBTQ/TGNB community support and disruptions in gender-affirming health care as predictors of psychological distress during the pandemic. We found that the pandemic exacerbated ongoing mental health disparities for TGNB individuals. Furthermore, reduced LGBTQ/TGNB support was associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Interruption and/or delay in gender-affirming health care was not associated with increased psychological distress during the pandemic. Special attention is needed to address the unique ways in which TGNB individuals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes increasing access to LGBTQ/TGNB community support and addressing long-standing health disparities.","Kidd, Jackman, Barucco, Dworkin, Dolezal, Navalta, Belloir, Bockting","https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2020.1868185","20210127","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; gender-affirming medical care; mental health; transgender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10020,""
"Addressing the Consequences of the COVID-19 Lockdown for Children's Mental Health: Investing in School Mental Health Programs","Children are likely to struggle with mental health consequences relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. School closures and home confinement increase the risk for emotional distress, domestic violence and abuse, and social isolation, as well as for disruption of sleep-wake and meal cycles, physical exercise routines, and health care access. As schools reopen, school mental health programs (SMHPs) incorporating universal approaches will be important for all children, and targeted approaches will be necessary for those more severely affected.

"Psychological and Behavioral Predictors of Vaccine Efficacy: Considerations for COVID-19","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidates are being evaluated, with the goal of conferring immunity on the highest percentage of people who receive the vaccine as possible. It is noteworthy that vaccine efficacy depends not only on the vaccine but also on characteristics of the vaccinated. Over the past 30 years, a series of studies has documented the impact of psychological factors on the immune system's vaccine response. Robust evidence has demonstrated that stress, depression, loneliness, and poor health behaviors can impair the immune system's response to vaccines, and this effect may be greatest in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Psychological factors are also implicated in the prevalence and severity of vaccine-related side effects. These findings have generalized across many vaccine types and therefore may be relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we discuss these psychological and behavioral risk factors for poor vaccine responses, their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as targeted psychological and behavioral interventions to boost vaccine efficacy and reduce side effects. Recent data suggest these psychological and behavioral risk factors are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but intervention research suggests that psychological and behavioral interventions can increase vaccine efficacy.","Madison, Shrout, Renna, Kiecolt-Glaser","https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691621989243","20210127","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; depression; health behaviors; stress; vaccine efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10023,""
"The Effect of Delayed Chemotherapy on the Decrease of CA125 in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer During Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in 2020","To investigate whether patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were affected by delayed chemotherapy during the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020. A delay of more than 21 days in the planned chemotherapy was defined as &quot;delayed chemotherapy.&quot; Forty-five patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer were delayed between January 1 and March 30, 2020 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Thirty-two cases were enrolled in this study. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used in 8 cases; palliative chemotherapy was used in 5 cases; and maintenance chemotherapy was used in 19 cases. Data included age, pathological type, surgical pathological stage, chemotherapy time and CA125 levels were collected. The half-life of CA125 and the decrease in CA125 levels before and after delayed chemotherapy were calculated. No patient got coronavirus disease. Compared with patients of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube epithelial cancer and peritoneal epithelial cancer in the same periods in 2019, the half-life of CA125 in neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and recurrence chemotherapy group were more than 20 days, but there was no significant difference. Only when the delayed chemotherapy took place before CA125 turned negative, accompanied by an interval of more than 60 days, the CA125 half-life and the decreased range of CA125 were totally affected. There was no evidence to support that once chemotherapy was delayed it would influence the decrease of CA125, but whether it would affect the long-term effects such as recurrence and five-year survival rate remains to be further followed up.","Yi, Ran, Li","https://doi.org/10.2147/CMAR.S289773","20210127","CA125; delayed chemotherapy; epithelial ovarian cancer; half-life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10024,""
"Anxiety Sensitivity Moderates the Impact of COVID-19 Perceived Stress on Anxiety and Functional Impairment","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound negative impact on mental health symptoms and daily life functioning across the United States and worldwide. Past work has revealed that perceived stress relates to poorer outcomes, however, little work to date has examined factors that may exacerbate these outcomes, and no work to date has examined this relation in terms of COVID-19. Anxiety sensitivity is a promising individual difference factor that has shown to be related to mental health and functional impairment. Anxiety Sensitivity is also a vulnerability factor related to heightened stress perception. Therefore, the current study sought to examine the potential moderating role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between COVID-19 specific perceived stress and global anxiety symptom severity, anxious arousal symptom severity, and functional impairment among 563 adults (58.1% male; <i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38.3Ã‚Â years; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.15). Results indicated a statistically significant interaction between COVID-19 perceived stress and anxiety sensitivity with global anxiety symptom severity, anxious arousal symptom severity, and functional impairment. Post-hoc analysis indicated that COVID-19 perceived stress was associated with an increased likelihood of clinically significant global anxiety symptom severity and anxious arousal symptom severity at higher levels of anxiety sensitivity. The current study provides support for the role of anxiety sensitivity in identifying individuals at risk for clinically significant global anxiety symptom severity and anxious arousal symptom severity.","Manning, Eades, Kauffman, Long, Richardson, Garey, Zvolensky, Gallagher","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10608-021-10207-7","20210127","COVID-19; Functional impairment; Mental health; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10025,""
"The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and their associations with quality of life among clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders is unclear. This study examined the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and their associations with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, insomnia, pain, and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. A total of 1063 patients were included. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and combined depressive and anxiety symptoms were 62.3% (95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°59.4-65.2%), 52.4% (95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49.3-55.4%), and 45.9% (95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42.9-48.9%), respectively. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms had significantly lower QOL than those without (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that having depressive symptoms was positively associated with more severe insomnia (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.29, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and pain (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.14, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and was negatively associated with other psychiatric diagnoses (except for major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and organic mental disorder; ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.50, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), while having anxiety symptoms was positively associated with severe physical diseases (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.57, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), poor adherence to treatment (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and more severe insomnia (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.15, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and pain (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.11, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01).

"Predictors of households at risk for food insecurity in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","To examine associations between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics with household risk for food insecurity during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cross-sectional online survey analyzed using univariable tests and a multivariable logistic regression model. The United States during the week of March 30, 2020. Convenience sample of 1,965 American adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants reporting household food insecurity prior to the pandemic were excluded from analyses. 1,250 participants reported household food security before the COVID-19 outbreak. Among this subset, 41% were identified as at risk for food insecurity after COVID-19, 55% were women and 73% were white. On multivariable analysis, race, income, relationship status, living situation, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with incident risk for food insecurity. Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino respondents, respondents with annual income less than $100,000, and those living with children or others were significantly more likely to be newly at risk for food insecurity. Individuals at risk for food insecurity were 2.60 (95% CI 1.91-3.55) times more likely to screen positively for anxiety and 1.71 (95% CI 1.21-2.42) times more likely to screen positively for depression. Increased risk for food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic is common, and certain populations are particularly vulnerable. There are strong associations between being at risk for food insecurity and anxiety/depression. Interventions to increase access to healthful foods, especially among minority and low-income individuals, and ease the socioemotional effects of the outbreak are crucial to relieving the economic stress of this pandemic.","Lauren, Silver, Faye, Rogers, Woo Baidal, Ozanne, Hur","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980021000355","20210127","COVID-19; Food insecurity; health disparities; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10027,""
"Obesity considerations during the COVID-19 outbreak","<b/> The worldwide population is facing a double burden of epidemic, the COVID-19 and obesity. This is even more alarming as obesity increases the COVID-19 severity. However, the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity is more complex than a simple association with BMI. In particular, obesity has been associated with low death rates in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a fatal comorbidity to COVID-19, possibly due to the obesity paradox. Also, visceral adiposity could be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severity, due to its immune activation component, release of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and involvement in the cytokine storm, hypercoagulability and embolism. A poor antioxidant nutritional status also weakens the immune system, increasing inflammation and infection risk. Moreover, the COVID-19 lockdown might impact lifestyle patterns, mental health and weight bias, worsening the obesity then COIVD-19 situation. On the other hand, health care expenses and productivity loss are expected to increase during the concomitant epidemics. The co-occurrence of obesity and COVID-19 is a major challenge at both public health and economic levels that should urgently be taken into consideration. The identification of COVID-19 weight related risk factors and the development of appropriate weight management programs are needed to tackle the concomitant epidemics.","Dohet, Loap, Menzel, Iddir, Dadoun, Bohn, Samouda","https://doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831/a000695","20210127","ACE2; COVID-19; Obesity; antioxidants; cytokine storm; visceral fat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10028,""
"Effect of Delivery Format on Student Outcomes and Perceptions of a Veterinary Medicine Course: Synchronous versus Asynchronous Learning","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted instruction at many veterinary schools to switch to an emergency remote teaching format to prevent viral transmission associated with in-person synchronous lectures. This study surveyed student perspectives and academic performance in a pre-planned online second-year veterinary toxicology course given at North Carolina State University in Spring 2020. This course relied on asynchronous narrated presentations for content delivery. This method of delivery predated the pandemic and was used throughout the course. Academic performance and patterns of access to materials in the online course was compared with the access patterns and performance of students given classroom-based synchronous teaching in Spring 2019. Assessments evaluated in this study were identical across courses. Students' academic performance was unaffected by delivery method. Lack of instructor interaction was an important perceived barrier in the asynchronous course. Asynchronous course materials were uniformly accessed across all days of the week, while supplemental materials for the face-to-face course showed a weekly pattern. Moving from letter grades to pass/fail did not change access frequency to supplemental course materials but led to decreased video usage in the asynchronous course. Results suggest that although some veterinary students perceived the switch in delivery format negatively, the method of delivery did not adversely affect performance in this preclinical course.","Schoenfeld-Tacher, Dorman","https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci8020013","20210127","emergency remote teaching; online learning; student perceptions; toxicology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-28","",10029,""
