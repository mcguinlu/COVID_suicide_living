"Cyberbullying in Neurodivergent Adolescents_Scoping Review Protocol PsyArXiv","Objective: The objective of this scoping review is to identify and map the range of evidence in relation to preventative education or intervention for cyberbullying among neurodivergent adolescents (aged 10 to 19). Introduction: Many young people with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) are more likely to experience cyberbullying victimisation than their peers. Considerable resources have been dedicated to managing this issue among mainstream adolescents; however, it is unclear whether prevention and intervention programs, resources, and/or strategies have been developed specifically to suit the learning needs of those who have an NDD. Methods: A scoping review following the PRISMA guidelines will be conducted in August-September 2022 using search terms in English. The following databases will be searched: ProQuest (including dissertations, theses, and conference papers and proceedings), PsychInfo, MEDLINE, Scopus (including conference papers and technical reports), and Google Scholar. Additional grey literature will be identified via targeted Google searches, as well as searches of government agency websites and organisations that focus on cyberbullying and digital safety in adolescents who are neurodivergent (e.g., eSafety Commissioner). Using EndNote, all references will be uploaded and organised for review. Two independent reviewers will screen the identified studies in accordance with the eligibility criteria. The data from included materials will be charted and presented as a narrative summary. Discussion: The findings from this scoping review will provide readers with an overview of the existing evidence, including unpublished online resources, that are currently available to support cyberbullying among adolescents with an NDD. The review will identify gaps in the existing evidence base to guide future directions for research. The findings of this review will be disseminated through methods such as journal publication and presentation at conferences relevant to adolescent communication, education, and mental health.","Emily Jackson et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01D2-799-83C","20220905","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-05","",37040,""
