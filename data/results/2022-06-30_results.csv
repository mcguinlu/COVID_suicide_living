"Adoption and Challenges Underlying OTT Platform in India during Pandemic: A Critical Study of Socio-Economic and Technological Issues","The present era of rapid technological changes and the rising rate of internet penetration has created a stride for an individual?s entertainment preferences. The rise of Over-the-Top (OTT) media services has made strides by altering the media space during the pandemic caused by COVID. Smart phones and access to broad band made OTT acceptable by a large part of the population worldwide. The handheld device OTT is becoming the preferred mode of content consumption by the viewers in India as well. However, there are certain shortcomings of this emerging mode of media mostly in terms of socio-economic as well as technological issues. In addition to finding the growing demands of OTT, present study emphasized on the challenges posed for the adoption of this rapidly preferred media platform. On the analysis of the data collected from the respondents in the twin city of Odisha (Cuttack and Bhubaneswar), the findings revealed three prime factors such as ?user behaviour?, ?technological flexibility? and ?customer-centric content? to be the significant influencers of OTT content. The insights of this study can help the regulatory authorities as well as OTT media players in promotion and strategy formulation.","Patnaik, Rabinarayan, Patra, Soumendra Kumar, Mahapatra, Durga Madhab, Baral, Sukanta Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1177/23197145221101676","","Database: sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: FIIB Business Review;: 23197145221101676, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33505,""
"Mental Wellbeing and Boosting Resilience to Mitigate the Adverse Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Critical Narrative Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally. Besides devastating physical health consequences, the mental health consequences are dire as well and are predicted to have a long-term impact for some individuals and communities and society as a whole. Specific keywords were entered into various popular databases at three points in time (June 2020, April 2021, and February 2022). Articles about COVID-19 that focused on mental health and/or discussed improving resilience/coping were reviewed by the authors. A total of 119 publications were included. The pandemic is certainly a chronic stressor for many people, and some may be traumatized in the aftermath which may lead to stress-related disorders. The psychological impacts of this stress and trauma are reported and findings presented around three key themes: mental health impact, impact in the workplace, and improving resilience. In addition, particularly vulnerable populations are discussed and some of the violence and inequities they might face. Resilience literature offers keys to promoting positive mental wellbeing during and after the pandemic. Being able to effectively respond to the heterogeneity of specific situations while building resilience is addressed. Prevention, preparedness, Psychological First Aid training, and trauma informed practice can all contribute to building resilience and promoting peri/post-traumatic growth at all levels of society. This narrative review provides an overview of the literature on mental health and resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors propose that, through the use of the accumulated empirical knowledge on resilience, we can mitigate many of the most damaging outcomes. Implications for mental health professionals, policy suggestions, and future research directions are explored.","Beckstein, A.; Chollier, M.; Kaur, S.; Ghimire, A.

"Studying Under Stress: The Effect of COVID-19 Psychological Distress on Academic Challenges and Performance of Post-Secondary Students","The COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant disruptions in the learning environment for many post-secondary students. While emerging evidence suggest mental health has declined during the pandemic, little is known about how the pandemic has affected students academically. This study investigates how COVID-19 psychological distress impacts academic performance among a Canadian sample of post-secondary students (n = 496). Path analysis findings suggest that greater levels of COVID-19 distress was associated with lower self-reported predicted GPA. Metacognitive, motivational, and social and emotional challenges emerged as the most salient challenge areas that fully mediated the relationship between COVID-19 psychological distress and self-reported predicted GPA. Specifically, COVID-19 distress predicted greater levels of metacognitive and motivational challenges which, in turn, predicted lower self-reported GPA. Similarly, greater levels of COVID-19 distress predicted more social and emotional challenges but these challenges were associated to higher perceived GPA. Findings warrant future research to help students manage and cope with academic challenges that may be exacerbated under stressful conditions.","Sukhawathanakul, Paweena, Hadwin, Allyson, Rostampour, Ramin, Bahena Olivares, Michelle, Shostak, Kate","https://doi.org/10.1177/15210251221104245","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory & Practice;: 152102512211042-152102512211042, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33507,""
"Pandemic Depression: COVID-19 and the Mental Health of the Self-Employed","We investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-employed people?s mental health. Using representative longitudinal survey data from Germany, we reveal differential effects by gender: whereas self-employed women experienced a substantial deterioration in their mental health, self-employed men displayed no significant changes up to early 2021. Financial losses are important in explaining these differences. In addition, we find larger mental health responses among self-employed women who were directly affected by government-imposed restrictions and bore an increased childcare burden due to school and daycare closures. We also find that self-employed individuals who are more resilient coped better with the crisis.","Caliendo, Marco, Graeber, Daniel, Kritikos, Alexander S.; Seebauer, Johannes","https://doi.org/10.1177/10422587221102106","","Database: sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice;: 10422587221102106, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33508,""
"Perspectives of socioeconomically disadvantaged parents on their children's coping during COVID-19: Implications for practice","Disruptions caused by COVID-19 have the potential to create long-term negative impacts on children's well-being and development, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged children. However, we know little about how socioeconomically disadvantaged families are coping with the pandemic, nor the types of support needed. This study presents qualitative analysis of responses to an open-ended question asking parents how children are coping with the restrictions associated with COVID-19, to identify areas in which these cohorts can be supported. Four main themes were identified: health concerns, schooling difficulties, social isolation and adjustment to restrictions. Health concerns included exacerbation of pre-existing health conditions, fear about the virus, difficulty getting children to understand the pandemic and increased sedentary behaviour. Schooling difficulties referred to the challenges of home schooling, which were behavioural (e.g. difficulty concentrating) and logistical (e.g. technology). Social isolation, expressed as missing friends, family and/or institutions was common. Finally, parents expressed that children experienced both positive adjustments to restrictions, such as spending more time with family, and negative adjustments such as increased screen time. Many responses from parents touched on topics across multiple themes, indicating a need for comprehensive, holistic assessment of children's and families' needs in the provision of support services. The content of the themes supports calls for resources to support children and families including increased financial and practical accessibility of social services, physical health and exercise support, mental health support and COVID-19 communication guides.","Seivwright, Ami N.; Callis, Zoe, Flatau, Paul R.","https://doi.org/10.1111/chso.12597","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children & Society; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33509,""
"How social support predicts anxiety among university students during COVID-19 control phase: Mediating roles of self-esteem and resilience","Public health emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic, generally has severe impacts on mental health in public. One of the often-neglected negative consequences is that the control and prevention measures of COVID-19 in the post-epidemic can pose psychological threats to public mental health. This study aimed to seek the factors and mechanisms to alleviate this mental health threat based on a sample of university students in China. Accordingly, this study proposed an environmental-individual interaction model examining the multiple mediating effects of self-esteem and resilience in the association between social support and anxiety among university students during COVID-19 control phase. A questionnaire containing multiple scales were administered on the sample of 2734 Chinese university students. Results indicated that social support negatively predicted anxiety through the serial mediating effects of self-esteem and resilience sequentially. Our results highlight the impact of social support and the internal factors on relieving anxiety among university students in COVID-19 control phase. Findings suggest that effective psychological intervention tools should be designed and offered to college students to reduce anxiety distress and improve mental health in the post-epidemic era or the similar situations in the future.","Shu, Yacong, Lin, Wenzheng, Yang, Jia, Huang, Pengfei, Li, Biqin, Zhang, Xing","https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12314","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33510,""
"Securing jobs with individual trait and organisational support?","Purpose In view of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on organisations and employees, this study aims to investigate a reverse relationship between role conflict, burnout and job insecurity, and proposed emotional intelligence (EI) and organisational support as individual and organisational factors, respectively, that may moderate this chain relationship. Drawing on conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper proposes that organisational support as an organisational factor and EI as an individual ability may aid in minimising the perception of the depletion of resources and play a moderating role in conflict-burnout-job insecurity relationships. Design/methodology/approach This study was undertaken in Australia with a focus on those who were employed and worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted online using the Qualtrics platform as it offers user-friendly features for respondents. In total, 723 usable responses were generated for data analysis. Structural equation modelling was performed to test the hypotheses of this study. Findings The results show that role conflict was significantly related to burnout, which in turn led to job insecurity. EI and organisational support reduced the impact of burnout on job insecurity. Originality/value Theoretically, this research deepens an understanding of COR and role theory and contributes to mental health research and organisational studies. COR depicts individuals' reservation of resources for desired or expected outcomes. This study approached from a depletion of resources perspective and revealed the consequences for both individuals and organisations. This study also expands role theory and includes job and family-derived roles to deepen the role conflict during the pandemic. Whilst most research taps into the job performance and behaviour domain to understand the impact of role conflict, this study proposed a novel concept of a mediation relationship between role conflict, burnout and job insecurity in line with the status quo of the pandemic. Consequently, this study contributes to job attitude research by approaching the antecedents from a combination of organisational, individual and situational factors because role conflict is reflected as a clash of job demands, family obligations and responsibilities, and the pandemic situation.","Zeidan, S.; Prentice, C.; Nguyen, M.","https://doi.org/10.1108/ijoa-12-2021-3076","","Database: English Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Organizational Analysis;: 22, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33511,""

"Self-care for clinicians during remote sessions: Adapting to the new world","The transition to remote work and telehealth for mental health clinicians has created a set of structural and individual considerations that previously had not needed to be considered in self-care plans. Recognizing the origins of discomfort and uncertainty clinicians may have experienced as human beings living and working during a pandemic informs an effective self-care plan. Changes to organization practice and the therapeutic relationship and milieu, and the resultant challenges, are also considerations for a revised plan. A supportive organization is one that has clear and consistent guardrails, a supportive environment, training opportunities, resources that allow clinicians to do their work remotely, and provides regular clinical supervision. Setting boundaries with oneself, limiting screen time and exposure to news outlets, and maintaining a clear work schedule works toward the well-being of clinicians.","Pruitt, D. K.; Glennon, A.

"The Family as a Protective Factor for Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Theoretical background: From spring 2020 to the present day, the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread limitations in daily life, including school closures, as well as to negative effects on the mental health of adolescents in the German-speaking countries. Objective: This study examined the associations between family support. psychological distress, and concern for others' health as aspects of solidarity among adolescents in Austria and Switzerland. We expected positive associations between family support and adolescents' reported concern for others' health and negative associations between family support and psychological distress. We further explored whether the two national samples differed in these aspects. Method: Adolescents (N = 458) aged 14 to 18 years from Austria (n = 158) and Switzerland (n = 300) completed an online survey in April and May 2020 on the three constructs ""Concern for other's health,"" ""Psychological distress,"" and ""Family support."" We conducted the statistical analyses using structural equation modeling. Results: We found measurement invariance between the two samples regarding all assessed constructs. As hypothesized, in both countries family support was positively related to concern for others' health and negatively related to psychological distress. Swiss adolescents reported higher concern for others' health and tower psychological distress than the Austrian sample. Discussion and Conclusion: The results feed into the theory of family resilience, suggesting that family support plays a crucial role in adolescents' well-being during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. Family support may also be related to adolescents' solidarity. However, the variance explained in our study was small indicating that other protective factors should be considered as well.","van Eickels, R.

"COVID-19 for Half a Lifetime: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Preschool Children and Their Caregivers","Theoretical Background: Over the last 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial restrictions in the everyday life of preschoolers. Objective: Our study investigates how preschoolers and their parents perceived the pandemic during the last 2 years. Based on preliminary findings demonstrating a pandemic-related increase in mental health problems, we further investigated enduring pandemic effects on the mental health of children. We hypothesized that family resilience is reduced after 1 year of the pandemic. Moreover, we expected a decline in overall mental health compared to prepandemic studies. Finally, we hypothesized that increased family tension and the stress regulation of children predict mental health problems. Method: In two online surveys conducted in May 2020 and March 2021, we collected the data of N = 304 parents and their children (aged 1-6 years). We assessed parents' and children's (self- and parent-reported) perception of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic's impact on family resilience, and (May 2021) children's mental health problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman et al., 1998). Because of the small sample size of both studies, we decided to cross-sectionally compare the surveys. Results: In tine with our hypothesis, children and parents reported higher levels of family tension and reduced stress-regulation abilities in 2021 compared to 2020. Moreover, parents reported increased levels of negative affect toward COVID-19. We found no significant changes in perceived infection risk but did find increased levels of mental health problems, especially externalizing problems in 2021 compared to prepandemic studies. Finally, the stress regulation of the children and family tension were significant predictors of the mental health problems of children. Discussion and Conclusion: Our findings highlight the persistent negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of preschoolers white also providing evidence for the psychological factors of resilience.","Maldei-Gohring, T.; Opdensteinen, K.

"Infant Behavioral Problems in the First Year of Life and Maternal Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from the ""CoviFam"" Online Survey","Theoretical background: The COVID-19 pandemic placed a burden on families in several respects, particularly because of the severe confinement imposed at its beginning. The confinement in spring 2020 led to social disruption and a reduction of supportive structures. In the first year of an infant's life, the psychological well-being of a mother-child dyad is particularly susceptible to external stressful changes. Research question: How did the restrictions from the pandemic affect families with children in the first year of the infant's life, particularly infant regulatory problems and related maternal stress? Methods: In an online survey, N = 577 mothers reported on their infants' behavior (0-12 months of age, M = 7.3 months, SD = 3.3) regarding their crying, sleeping, and feeding/eating behavior as well as the respective distress experienced during the restrictions. Measures of current maternal well-being included overall perceived stress, depressivity, relationship satisfaction, and maternal bonding. Frequency/duration of infantile crying, sleep latency as well as night awakenings and feeding/eating problems were surveyed following clinical criteria (DC: 0-5) and percentile scores, respectively. The association of infant behavior and maternal distress was examined using linear regression and MANOVA. Results: Overall, at least one in five mothers felt burdened by her child's regulatory problems during the time of severe restrictions. More than one in four mothers reported being highly or very highly distressed by her child's crying. Sleeping problems, such as prolonged steep latency (&gt; 90th percentile) or several nightly awakenings, were reported for 21.7% of the children. Difficulty to console and frequent crying were reported for 12.3% and excessive crying for 1.6% of the children. Higher levels of stress as well as increased impairment in maternal bonding and less relationship satisfaction explained 17- 21% of the variance of maternal distress from crying and sleeping problems. Significantly more distress was evident in the group of mothers who reported increased crying and prolonged latency to fall asleep (&gt; 45 min) and with more than one child in the household during the period of most severe restrictions (MANOVA). A lack of medical, psychotherapeutic, and other means of care was reported by nearly a quarter of the respondents and was the only restriction that was significantly related to the perception of more stressful child behavior. Discussion and conclusion: Pandemic-related stressors for first-year mothers appear to be enhanced by limited access to the care system, caring for more than one child, the increasing age of the child, while a good relationship with the child (bonding) and/or partner (relationship) satisfaction provide buffers.","von Tettenborn, A.; Popp, L.; Zietlow, A.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children, Adolescents, and Their Families in German Speaking Countries","The current state of knowledge points to the COVID-19 pandemic as likely having fewer fatal somatic consequences than expected. However, the repercussions for the mental health of children and adolescents are alarmingly on the rise. These findings are even more alerting because they affect a system that was already heavily burdened before the pandemic. Moreover, efforts must be targeted on the as yet unclear consequences for the overall psychological, social, and emotional development of these age groups, since, for example, common learning spaces with peers were lacking over long periods or were accessible only to a limited extent. Regarding children and adolescents themselves, the immediate reference system of parents and family is also relevant for identifying potential protective and risk factors.

"The effective delivery of digital CBT: a service evaluation exploring the outcomes of young people who completed video conferencing therapy in 2020","Despite its impressive evidence base, there is a widening access gap to receiving cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Video conferencing therapy (VCT) offers an effective solution for logistical barriers to treatment, which has been salient throughout the Coronavirus pandemic. However, research concerning the delivery of CBT via VCT for children and young people (CYP) is in its infancy, and clinical outcome data are limited. The aim of this service evaluation was to explore the effectiveness of a VCT CBT intervention for CYP referred from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in the UK. A total of 989 records of CYP who had completed CBT via VCT in 2020 with Healios, a digital mental health company commissioned by the National Health Service (NHS), were examined to determine changes in anxiety, depression and progress towards personalised goals. Routine outcome measures (ROMs) were completed at baseline and endpoint, as well as session by session. Feedback was collected from CYP and their families at the end of treatment. There was a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression and significant progress towards goals, with pre- to post-effect sizes (Cohen's d) demonstrating medium to large effects (d=.45 to d=-1.39). Reliable improvement ranged from 31 to 80%, clinical improvement ranged from 33 to 50%, and 25% clinically and reliably improved on at least one measure;92% reported that they would recommend Healios. This service evaluation demonstrates that Healios' CBT delivered via VCT is effective for CYP receiving it as part of routine mental health care.","Porter, C. M.; Galloghly, E.; Burbach, F.

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study","Objectives: In addition to risking their physical well-being, frontline physicians are enduring significant emotional burden both at work and home during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to identify associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and design: A cross-sectional study using an online survey following a convenience sampling technique was conducted between April 21 and May 10, 2020. Outcomes assessed included demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: The survey was completed by 412 Bangladeshi physicians. The findings revealed that, in terms of standardized HADS cut-off points, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians was 67.72% and 48.5% respectively. Risk factors for higher rates of anxiety or depressive symptoms were: being female, physicians who had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms during the pandemic, those who had not received incentives, those who used self-funded personal protective equipment (PPE), not received adequate training, lacking perceived self-efficacy to manage COVID-19 positive patients, greater perceived stress of being infected, fear of getting assaulted/humiliated, being more connected with social media, having lower income levels to support the family, feeling more agitated, less than 2 hours of leisure activity per day and short sleep duration. All these factors were found to be positively associated with anxiety and depression in unadjusted and adjusted statistical models. Conclusions: This study identifies a real concern about the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi physicians and identifies several associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the vulnerability of the physicians in this extraordinary period whilst they are putting their own lives at risk to help people infected by COVID-19, health authorities should address the psychological needs of medical staff and formulate effective strategies to support vital frontline health workers.","Hasan, M.

"Loneliness, Belonging, and Mental Health in Australian University Students Pre- and Post-COVID-19","The move to online learning during COVID-19 deprived first-year students of friendships and other sources of social support that could buffer against stress during their transition to university. These effects may have been worse for international students than domestic students as many were subjected to travel restrictions or quarantine in addition to the usual stressors. This study examined the impact of COVID-19 on social connectedness and mental health of first-year students enrolled in a metropolitan university in Australia. The study involved 1239 students (30.4% international) and used a 3 (cohorts: 2019, 2020, 2021) x 2 (enrolment status: domestic and international) between-group design. Results showed that both loneliness and university belonging were significantly worse during the first year of COVID-19 compared to the year before or after. Contrary to expectation, domestic students were lonelier than international students across all cohorts. Multiple-group memberships did not change. As predicted, loneliness was moderately to highly correlated with the number of stressors, psychological distress, and (lower) well-being, whereas university belonging and multiple-group memberships were related to positive mental health outcomes. These findings highlight the need for initiatives that promote student connectedness and mental health as the university sector recovers from COVID-19.","Dingle, G.

"The challenges and opportunities of online learning and teaching at engineering and theoretical colleges during the pandemic","Education has been one of the major areas disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on users' (students and faculty members) learning in higher education, examining how engineering students and faculty perceived the abrupt transition in comparison to other colleges. The current research aims to investigate the outcomes of enforcing eLearning to facilitate teaching and learning processes in higher education after this unprecedented pandemic and identify the most significant challenges and opportunities the users face. This study uses a quantitative approach;it included 1713 respondents, 227 full-time faculty members, and 1486 students at the University of Sharjah. The survey analysis indicated general agreement that the most significant advantage of online learning implementation was its flexibility in place and time, with 77.2% of users providing positive feedback. Moreover, the accessibility and effectiveness of the assessment and communication methods used showed a positive trend in the hypotheses, 80.3% of the users. The sudden implementation of eLearning during the COVID-19 pandemic had discouraging implications for users' mental health and socialization, where 55.6% of the sample agreed that they had been affected negatively. 75% of the users prefer a flexible model blending face-to-face and e-learning techniques rather than solely depending on either of them. Therefore, A Hybrid-Flexible (HyFlex) is recommended for the university to apply based on the nature of the courses. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

"Digital health literacy and well-being Results of a quantitative study among university students in Austria during the coronavirus pandemic","Background Previous findings suggest that depressive and anxiety-related symptoms have doubled among students since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Digital health literacy can act as a protective resource to strengthen well-being. Objectives This paper analyzes the relationship between digital health literacy, socioeconomic status, well-being and future-anxiety among students in Austria. Methods A total of 480 students from Austrian higher education institutions were surveyed via online questionnaire during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Sociodemographic data, students' self-assessments of well-being, fears about the future, and digital health literacy were collected. Variance and regression analyses were used for the evaluation. Results About 50% of the students reported low well-being and distinct fears about the future. Regarding digital health literacy, the ability to assess the relevance of information showed the highest correlation with well-being. A higher socioeconomic status correlated with higher well-being as well as lower fears about the future. Conclusions The assessment of the relevance of information and connecting it with one's own life reality seems to be an important factor in promoting well-being. Individual factors such as gender or the study program are relevant for the relationship between well-being and digital health literacy.","Reitegger, F.; Wright, M.; Berger, J.; Gasteiger-Klicpera, B.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11553-022-00954-0","","Database: Web of Science Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pravention Und Gesundheitsforderung;: 7, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33528,""
"Adaptation and development of IR services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: preliminary results of a focused survey","Purpose: The cyclic nature of active and recovery phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, has demanded fast adaptations and preparation for health care workers world-wide. We aimed to assess how interventional radiologists are handling the pandemic during active and recovery phases with regard to work and team structures, as well as mental health and how the pandemic could have increased the awareness of minimally-invasive therapies as alternatives to postponements of non-urgent procedures. Material and methods: 7125 CIRSE members were invited to participate. For this interim report, responses were collected between 23 November 2021 and 17 December 2021. Results: 114 responses were obtained for this preliminary report, of which 102 were complete. 94% (n=99) of respondents were interventional radiology specialists. Most respondents reported having established a routine to handle different waves of the pandemic (89.5%;n=102). Compared to active phases, fewer respondents indicated at least one pandemic-associated measure in their department during recovery phases (46%-71% vs 13%). 56% reported an increase in ambulatory care patients either during active and/or recovery phases. 54% reported more referrals during active and/or recovery phases. 25% reported increased hours at the hospital during recovery phases, 52% indicated increased sick leave, care leave, quarantine, and burn-out of team members and only 39% reported to get enough time to rest during recovery phases. Conclusion: While the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to burden IR departments and the mental health of IRs, more than half of respondents reported an increase in referrals for minimally-invasive therapies and ambulatory care.","Gomez MuÃ±oz, F.; Reimer, P.; Pereira, P.; Bent, C.; Cazzato, R.; Das, M.; Diamantopoulos, A.; Zeka, B.; Nathalie, K.; Makris, G.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-022-03133-y","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology; 45(SUPPL 1):S57, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33529,""
"Social connectedness, mindfulness, and coping as protective factors during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented psychological impact, revealing immense emotional disturbances among the general population. This study examined the extent to which social connectedness, dispositional mindfulness, and coping moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression in 1242 adults under the same government-issued COVID-19 stay-at-home mandate. Participants completed measures of anxiety, depression, dispositional mindfulness, social connectedness, and coping, and regression analyses were used to examine associations and interaction effects. Results indicated that social connectedness and dispositional mindfulness were associated with reduced symptoms. For individuals living with a partner, decreased mindfulness and avoidant coping were associated with anxious symptoms. In households with children, overutilization of approach coping served to increase symptoms of depression. Results indicate the importance of considering social connectedness, mindfulness, and coping in counseling to enhance factors serving to protect clients during a public health crisis. Implications for professional counselors and areas of future research are discussed.","Dailey, Stephanie F.; Parker, Maggie M.; Campbell, Andrew","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcad.12450","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Counseling & Development; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33530,""
"Impact of social protection on gender equality in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review of reviews","Background More than half of the global population is not effectively covered by any type of social protection benefit and women's coverage lags behind. Most girls and boys living in low-resource settings have no effective social protection coverage. Interest in these essential programmes in low and middle-income settings is rising and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic the value of social protection for all has been undoubtedly confirmed. However, evidence on whether the impact of different social protection programmes (social assistance, social insurance and social care services and labour market programmes) differs by gender has not been consistently analysed. Evidence is needed on the structural and contextual factors that determine differential impacts. Questions remain as to whether programme outcomes vary according to intervention implementation and design. Objectives This systematic review aims to collect, appraise, and synthesise the evidence from available systematic reviews on the differential gender impacts of social protection programmes in low and middle-income countries. It answers the following questions: What is known from systematic reviews on the gender-differentiated impacts of social protection programmes in low and middle-income countries? What is known from systematic reviews about the factors that determine these gender-differentiated impacts? What is known from existing systematic reviews about design and implementation features of social protection programmes and their association with gender outcomes? 1.2.3. Search Methods We searched for published and grey literature from 19 bibliographic databases and libraries. The search techniques used were subject searching, reference list checking, citation searching and expert consultations. All searches were conducted between 10 February and 1 March 2021 to retrieve systematic reviews published within the last 10 years with no language restrictions. Selection Criteria We included systematic reviews that synthesised evidence from qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods studies and analysed the outcomes of social protection programmes on women, men, girls, and boys with no age restrictions. The reviews included investigated one or more types of social protection programmes in low and middle-income countries. We included systematic reviews that investigated the effects of social protection interventions on any outcomes within any of the following six core outcome areas of gender equality: economic security and empowerment, health, education, mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, safety and protection and voice and agency. Data Collection and Analysis A total of 6265 records were identified. After removing duplicates, 5250 records were screened independently and simultaneously by two reviewers based on title and  and 298 full texts were assessed for eligibility. Another 48 records, identified through the initial scoping exercise, consultations with experts and citation searching, were also screened. The review includes 70 high to moderate quality systematic reviews, representing a total of 3289 studies from 121 countries. We extracted data on the following areas of interest: population, intervention, methodology, quality appraisal, and findings for each research question. We also extracted the pooled effect sizes of gender equality outcomes of meta-analyses. The methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed, and framework synthesis was used as the synthesis method. To estimate the degree of overlap, we created citation matrices and calculated the corrected covered area. Main Results Most reviews examined more than one type of social protection programme. The majority investigated social assistance programmes (77%, N = 54), 40% (N = 28) examined labour market programmes, 11% (N = 8) focused on social insurance interventions and 9% (N = 6) analysed social care interventions. Health was the most researched (e.g., maternal health;70%, N = 49) outcome area, followed by economic security and empowerment (e.g., savings;39%, N = 27) and education (e.g., school enrolment and attendance;24%, N = 17). Five key findings were consistent across intervention and outcomes areas: (1) Although pre-existing gender differences should be considered, social protection programmes tend to report higher impacts on women and girls in comparison to men and boys;(2) Women are more likely to save, invest and share the benefits of social protection but lack of family support is a key barrier to their participation and retention in programmes;(3) Social protection programmes with explicit objectives tend to demonstrate higher effects in comparison to social protection programmes without broad objectives;(4) While no reviews point to negative impacts of social protection programmes on women or men, adverse and unintended outcomes have been attributed to design and implementation features. However, there are no one-size-fits-all approaches to design and implementation of social protection programmes and these features need to be gender-responsive and adapted;and (5) Direct investment in individuals and families' needs to be accompanied by efforts to strengthen health, education, and child protection systems. Social assistance programmes may increase labour participation, savings, investments, the utilisation of health care services and contraception use among women, school enrolment among boys and girls and school attendance among girls. They reduce unintended pregnancies among young women, risky sexual behaviour, and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections among women. Social insurance programmes increase the utilisation of sexual, reproductive, and maternal health services, and knowledge of reproductive health;improve changes in attitudes towards family planning;increase rates of inclusive and early initiation of breastfeeding and decrease poor physical wellbeing among mothers. Labour market programmes increase labour participation among women receiving benefits, savings, ownership of assets, and earning capacity among young women. They improve knowledge and attitudes towards sexually transmitted infections, increase self-reported condom use among boys and girls, increase child nutrition and overall household dietary intake, improve subjective wellbeing among women. Evidence on the impact of social care programmes on gender equality outcomes is needed. Authors' Conclusions Although effectiveness gaps remain, current programmatic interests are not matched by a rigorous evidence base demonstrating how to appropriately design and implement social protection interventions. Advancing current knowledge of gender-responsive social protection entails moving beyond effectiveness studies to test packages or combinations of design and implementation features that determine the impact of these interventions on gender equality. Systematic reviews investigating the impact of social care programmes, old age pensions and parental leave on gender equality outcomes in low and middle-income settings are needed. Voice and agency and mental health and psychosocial wellbeing remain under-researched gender equality outcome areas.","Perera, C.; Bakrania, S.; Ipince, A.; Nesbitt-Ahmed, Z.; Obasola, O.; Richardson, D.; Van de Scheur, J.; Yu, R.

"EFFECTS of the COVID-19 LOCKDOWN on MENTAL HEALTH CARE USE in PEOPLE LIVING with HIV","Background: Mental health complications are highly prevalent among people living with HIV. Left untreated mental health complications can negatively affect HIV treatment outcomes. In March 2020, South Africa introduced a lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns might induce or exacerbate mental health conditions and limit access to treatment. We studied the effect of the lockdown on mental health care use among HIV-positive beneficiaries of a South African private sector medical aid scheme. Methods: We performed an interrupted time series analysis using insurance claims from January 1, 2017, to June 1, 2020 of HIV-positive beneficiaries aged 18 years or older from a large private sector medical aid scheme. Weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates were calculated for substance use disorders (ICD10 F10-F19), serious mental disorders (F20-F29, F31), depression (F32, F34.1, F54), anxiety (F40-F48), and any mental disorder (F00-F99). We estimated adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the effect of the lockdown on weekly hospital admission and outpatient consultation rates. Results: 61,873 adults living with HIV were followed up for a median of 151 weeks. Hospital admission rates (OR 0.38;95% CI 0.27-0.54) and outpatient consultation rates (OR 0.72;95% CI 0.64-0.82) for any mental disorder decreased substantially after the implementation of the lockdown in March 2020 and did not recover to pre-lockdown levels until June 1, 2020 (Figure). Substantial decreases were observed in hospital admissions rates for substance use disorders (OR 0.13;95% CI 0.02-0.73), depression (OR 0.30;95% CI 0.16-0.54), and serious mental disorders (OR 0.58;95%CI 0.17-2.02). Decreases in outpatient consultation rates were observed for substance use disorders (OR 0.21;95% CI 0.08-0.55), anxiety disorders (OR 0.64;95% CI 0.54-0.76), depression (OR 0.71;95% CI 0.62-0.82), and serious mental disorders (OR 0.85;95% CI 0.72-1.00). Conclusion: Reduced mental health care contact rates during the COVID-19 lockdown likely reflect a substantial unmet need for mental health services with potential long-term consequences for people living with HIV and comorbid mental health complications. Steps to ensure access and continuity of mental health services during future lockdowns should be considered.","Wettstein, A. E.; Tlali, M.; Joska, J.; Cornell, M.; Skrivankova, V.

"CLINICAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED with PASC in KAISER PERMANENTE MID-ATLANTIC STATES","Background: The natural history of the longer-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), known as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), is limited. Disease characterization and definition changed over time and identification via standard diagnosis codes was only recently enacted. We aim to identify a cohort of individuals with, or at-risk for, PASC among Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS) members, and to identify the clinical conditions of greater burden for those with PASC. Methods: Within our electronic health record system (including internal/external records), we identified adult patients (=18 years) who had a detectable SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result between 1/1/2020-12/31/2020. Non-COVID disease diagnoses/conditions were categorized into specific time intervals based on the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test as the index date (T0), defined as: 1) ""prevalent"": diagnoses in 4 years prior to T0 and excluded from later consideration;2) ""persistent/acute"": new disease diagnoses 0-30 days post-T0 and persisted 30-120 days further, and not included as prevalent;3) ""incident/late"": new disease diagnoses 30-120 days post-T0, not previously identified as prevalent or persistent/acute. Diagnoses were grouped using Clinical Classification Software (CCS) to isolate conditions for PASC. Final CCS distributions were computed relative to the condition counts for each time interval, validated by infectious disease physicians to identify conditions of focus (COF). Results: From the resulting 31,390 patients, we identified the 14 most common COF (Table 1). The most common persistent/acute COF were other lower respiratory disease (4.5%) and respiratory failure (2.7%). Most common incident/late COF (i.e., &gt;2.0% of those testing COVID+) were abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disorders, other nervous system disorders, nonspecific chest pain, dizziness or vertigo, malaise and fatigue, anxiety disorders, mental health disorders, other lower respiratory disease (not previously diagnosed), and cardiac dysrhythmias. No other COF were &gt;2.0% in the persistent or incident time periods. Conclusion: We have identified conditions clinically associated with COVID-19 that persist from infection or present as incident beyond the acute COVID-19 period. This condition list should be utilized in clinical practice when following up with COVID-19 patients. Further research is needed to understand how these conditions compare to people who did not have COVID-19 and to describe their severity, persistence, and resolution.","Watson, E. S.; Horberg, M.

"NEUROPSYCHOLOGIC PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING COVID-19: PREVALENCE and PREDICTORS","Background: Insomnia, mood decline, anxiety, and cognitive impairment are described following COVID-19, and the mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully clarified. Aims of this analysis were to describe prevalence and predictors of impaired neuropsychological performance after COVID-19. Methods: We included patients referred to the post-COVID19 service with and without a previous hospitalization (PH and nPH, respectively) assessed at 3,6 and 12 months (3M,6M,12M) post-COVID19. Patients underwent to a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment using a standardized battery of 10 tests across 4 domains (speed of information processing, /executive, attention/working memory, memory). Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) was defined by: score &gt;1 standard deviation (SD) below the mean on at least 2 tests, or &gt;2 SD below 1 test. Change in NPZ-10 (mean, SD) was analyzed as an outcome. In addition, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered. Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests were used for comparisons, and logistic and linear regression were used to identify factors associated with test results. Results: N=302 participants: median age of 55 years (IQR 47-61), 52% female, median education of 13 yrs (13-18), 63% with &gt;1 comorbidity, 58% PH (mainly males, higher age and higher BMI vs nPH). Overall, the prevalence of NCI was 42%, higher in PH vs nPH (46% vs 36%;p=0.07) (Figure 1a) with a not statistically significant mean decrease of NPZ10 [-0.12 (0.49)]. More in detail, we observed a significant decrease of z-score in the speed of information processing domain in PH vs nPH [-0.29(0.48) vs-0.12(0.31);p&lt;0.001]. NCI prevalence resulted significantly higher in PH vs nPH only at 3M (Figure 1b). A higher proportion of nPH vs PH complained anxiety (BAI&gt;85%) at 3M [55.6% vs 31.4%);p=0.028], sleep disturbances were more frequent in PH vs nPH at 3 and 12M (Figure 1d,c). Male gender appear to be the only associated factor with a lower alteration of BAI&gt;85% and PSQI&gt;5 [OR 0.28 (0.12-0.65);p=0.003;0.22 (0.09-0.52);p=0.001;respectively]. No predictors of NCI or BDI&gt;85% were found. Conclusion: Our preliminary data show a consistent prevalence of NCI, significantly higher in PH vs nPH. This finding remains quite stable up to 12 months of observation. Also a worse sleep quality in PH was observed.

"Persistent COVID-19 and chronic pain Are we prepared?: Presentation of three clinical cases and review of the literature","Long COVID is a term that describes a group of multiorganic symptoms that affect patients who have suffered from COVID-19 and who remain symptomatic for a sustained period of time after the acute phase of the disease. Amongst those symptoms, pain is one of the most frequently reported, shaping into different specific syndromes such as persistent thoracic pain, generalized pain, arthralgia, myalgia and cephalalgia. Multiple mechanisms can explain the onset and perpetuation of chronic pain in these patients. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is a neurotropic virus that can alter the somatosensory nervous system and which can also cause an intense autoimmune response with effects on multiple organs and systems. We present three clinical cases of long COVID where pain was the main symptom altogether with anxiety, depression, insomnia, catastrophic thoughts related to pain, cognitive impairment and post-traumatic stress disorder. These all show the existing complexity in the management of this new-found entity. Given the extensive number of SARS-CoV-2 infections reported globally, chronic pain in relation to long COVID can become a public health issue. Therefore, it is necessary to make it visible and to establish strategies to prevent it and confront it.","Salazar, M. A.; Garcia, A. R.; Ferreres, D. F.; NiÃ±o, A. O.; Taxte, C.

"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS ON FERTILITY-RELATED STRESS AND FERTILITY OUTCOMES IN AN IVF POPULATION","OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis on fertility-related stress and early pregnancy outcomes We hypothesize that COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis would negatively impact fertility-related stress and subsequently fertility and early pregnancy outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single academic center, patients undergoing fertility treatments via IVF or FET between the ages of 18 to 45 were eligible to participate in this study. Patients were recruited at the beginning of their treatment cycle and completed the validated FertiQOL questionnaire as well as an online survey assessing COVID-19 exposure. Primary outcomes include pandemic-related stress levels such as grief, mood, anger, and pain. Cohorts studied included: non-COVID (no concern for COVID-19 infection, including no formal diagnosis or perceived illness) and COVID (perceived/symptomatic or confirmed diagnosis) patients. FertiQOL questionnaire results were analyzed between the two cohort groups. RESULTS: A total of 115 subjects were recruited. The non-COVID cohort consisted of 64 participants and the COVID cohort consisted of 51 participants. There was a significant decrease in satisfaction with the level of support from friends/family (p=0.04), in COVID patients compared to non- COVID patients. COVID patients were more likely for their infertility to negatively impact their mood (p= 0.0005). Though not statistically significant, COVID cohort patients trended towards poorer self-perceived health and decreased satisfaction with available fertility services. There were no significant differences in overall quality of life, anger, depression, pain, or perceived complications with use of medications and treatments. There was also not a significant difference in number of eggs retrieved, percent of mature eggs, or clinical/ongoing pregnancy rates. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on infertility patient populations. Specifically, COVID patients with infertility experienced significantly decreased mood and less support from family and friends compared to non-COVID patients. While there is no difference in overall quality of life, or fertility and early pregnancy outcomes, understanding the nuances of patients' experiences in the pandemic will allow for more insight into the way in which care is provided. Additionally, COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure does not appear to affect fertility treatment or early pregnancy outcomes. Therefore patients may be counseled that previous COVID-19 infection or concerns regarding possible exposure do not affect their fertility and early pregnancy outcomes. IMPACT STATEMENT: This study shows the negative impact of perceived and confirmed COVID-19 exposure on stress levels related to infertility. These findings can guide how IVF patients are counseled and reassured during the pandemic.","Salari, S. M.; Chung, R.

"The effects of quarantine on anxiety and emotional symptoms Results of an online survey","Background: Quarantines may exacerbate the presence of emotional symptoms or anxiety. Aim: To explore the relation between time spent in lockdown and development of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Material and Methods: A survey including the GAD anxiety and PHQ-9 depression scores was answered online by 1,488 subjects aged 36 +/- 14 years (74% women), invited to participate through social networks. Both scores are validated for the Chilean population. Results: Most responders had a private health insurance system. Sixty seven percent had clinically significant depressive symptoms and 39% had anxiety symptoms. Spending four or more weeks of lockdown (quarantine) was associated with 1.6 times higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and 2.9 times higher risk of developing anxiety symptoms. Difficulties in access to health care increased 3.3 times the risk of developing depression. Suffering a respiratory disease increased 2.39 times the risk of developing anxiety.

"Improving mealtimes for patients and staff within an eating disorder unit: the next chapter","Mealtimes are an integral part of treatment for patients in an eating disorder inpatient unit. However, they are often distressing and anxiety provoking for both patients and staff. A consequence of patients' distress is an increase in eating disorder behaviours specific to mealtimes. This is the second paper detailing a quality improvement project following on from an initial paper outlining the first test of change. The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease the number of eating disorder behaviours at mealtimes in the dining room through the implementation of interventions identified through diagnostic work. The Model for Improvement was used as the systematic approach for this project. Baseline assessment included observations in the dining room, gathering of qualitative feedback from staff and patients and the development of a form which identifies eating disorder behaviours completed by staff. Interventions in the form of three change ideas have so far been introduced including (1) a host role in the dining room, (2) a guide to the dining room for new staff along with competencies and (3) a dining goals group. The impact of the three interventions is assessed. The introduction of the interventions has overall reduced the average number of eating disorder behaviours per patient in the dining room by 33%. This paper reports the challenges and successes of continuing a QI project through the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for multiple tests of change to improve a complex problem. The results demonstrate a consistent reduction in eating disorder behaviours over a period of nearly 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years.","Gardner, Tillier, Marshall-Tyson, Trueman, Hunt","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2022-001955","20220629","anorexia nervosa; mental health; quality improvement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33542,""
"What works for whom with telemental health: A rapid realist review","Telemental health (delivering mental health care via video calls, telephone calls or text messages) is increasingly widespread. Telemental health appears to be useful and effective in providing care to some service users in some settings, especially during an emergency restricting face-to-face contact such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, important limitations have been reported, and telemental health implementation risks reinforcing pre-existing inequalities in service provision. If it is to be widely incorporated in routine care, a clear understanding is needed of when and for whom it is an acceptable and effective approach, and when face-to-face care is needed. The aim of this rapid realist review was to develop theory about which telemental health approaches work, or do not work, for whom, in which contexts and through what mechanisms. Rapid realist reviewing involves synthesising relevant evidence and stakeholder expertise to allow timely development of context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations in areas where evidence is urgently needed to inform policy and practice. The CMOs encapsulate theories about what works for whom, and by what mechanisms. Sources included eligible papers from (a) two previous systematic reviews conducted by our team on telemental health, (b) an updated search using the strategy from these reviews, (c) a call for relevant evidence, including ""grey literature"", to the public and key experts, and (d) website searches of relevant voluntary and statutory organisations. CMOs formulated from these sources were iteratively refined, including through (a) discussion with an expert reference group including researchers with relevant lived experience and front-line clinicians and (b) consultation with experts focused on three priority groups: 1) children and young people, 2) users of inpatient and crisis care services, and 3) digitally excluded groups. A total of 108 scientific and grey literature sources were included. From our initial CMOs, we derived 30 overarching CMOs within four domains: 1) connecting effectively; 2) flexibility and personalisation; 3) safety, privacy, and confidentiality; and 4) therapeutic quality and relationship. Reports and stakeholder input emphasised the importance of personal choice, privacy and safety, and therapeutic relationships in telemental health care. The review also identified particular service users likely to be disadvantaged by telemental health implementation, and a need to ensure that face-to-face care of equivalent timeliness remains available. Mechanisms underlying successful and unsuccessful application of telemental health are discussed. Service user choice, privacy and safety, the ability to connect effectively and fostering strong therapeutic relationships, need to be prioritised in delivering telemental health care. Guidelines and strategies co-produced with service users and frontline staff are needed to optimise telemental health implementation in real-world settings.","Schlief, Saunders, Appleton, Barnett, Vera San Juan, Foye, Olive, Machin, Chipp, Shah, Lyons, Tamworth, Persaud, Badhan, Black, Sin, Riches, Graham, Greening, Pirani, Griffiths, Jeynes, McCabe, Lloyd-Evans, Simpson, Needle, Trevillion, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.2196/38239","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33543,""
"The impact of SARS-CoV 2 (COVID-19) on the acuity of diagnosis at admission for young adults in NYC and Washington, DC: An observational study","The COVID-19 pandemic has required restrictive measures put in place to mitigate transmission of the coronavirus COVID-19. Evidence has demonstrated an increased generalized anxiety and depression within young adults due to COVID-19 pandemic. However, little research has examined the longitudinal effect of COVID-19 over the course of time and its impact of anxiety and depression. Additionally, as it relates to incidences and severity of depression and anxiety. Age age and gender have been found to play a significant on individual's mental health with young adults and females particularly at risk. This study sought to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression upon admissions to treatment. The current study is an observational study that was completed longitudinally in which, the grouping variable split the time interval into five equal groups and assessed over that period of time. 112 young adults (aged 18-25) were recruited for the study. Participants completed assessments online through Qualtrics link. Psychometric properties of the admission assessments were uniformly highly statistically significant. There was a significant difference for generalized anxiety between group 1 interval and group 3 interval. No significant difference was noted across the time intervals for depression. Differences were noted to predict the impact of the psychometrics scores on gender. Only the ability to participate and the quality-of-life sub-factor of the FACIT assessment were significant. The current study sought to understand the impact that COVID had on young adults seeking mental health services during the pandemic. It was apparent that gender was a significant factor for increased anxiety in young adults seeking mental health services during the pandemic.

"Coping Strategies and Their Relationship With Subjective Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil","To identify the strategies used by Brazilian adults for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and to verify the effect of these strategies on subjective distress. This was a cross-sectional observational study with online data collection in May/June 2020, November/December 2020, and May/June 2021. The BriefCOPE Inventory and the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) were used. The prevalence of strategies used at different time points was estimated with a 95% confidence interval and compared with a z-test. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed and the odds ratio (OR, 95%CI) was calculated to verify the probability of subjective distress according to the coping strategy used. Younger individuals had a lower prevalence of adaptive strategies, which increased significantly with age. Participants with higher income levels had a higher prevalence of adaptive strategies, as did those who were never diagnosed with a mental health disorder. The prevalence of using only maladaptive strategies ranged from 6.1% to 5.4% (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The use of problem-centered strategies (Active Coping and Planning), venting of emotions, and substance use increased with time, while acceptance and behavioral disengagement decreased. In general, the population used problem-centered strategies, but the high prevalence of problem avoidance was striking. Positive reinterpretation and acceptance were protective factors for subjective distress, whereas maladaptive strategies increased the chance of distress. The presence of a negative valence component (problem- or emotion-centered) increased the chance of subjective distress, whereas strategies based on Problem Solving acted as a protective factor. Coping strategies were significantly associated to subjective distress and have changed since the beginning of the pandemic. Strategies focused on emotion regulation may be relevant to minimize distress.","Campos, Campos, Martins, MarÃƒÂ´co","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221110538","20220629","COVID-19; coping strategies; pandemic; subjective distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33545,""
"The relationship between family variables and family social problems during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined the relationship between variables about family members co-residing during the COVID-19 pandemic and anxiety about COVID-19, domestic violence from spouse, child abuse anxiety, internet addiction, and mental health as social problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 220 parents (70 male and 150 female, age; M = 41.6, SD = 34.4) were included in the analysis. Stepwise hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted with dependent variables of fear of COVID-19, spousal violence, anxiety regarding perpetrating child abuse, internet addiction, and mental health. The independent variables were basic variables related to family members such as family composition. The results demonstrated that parents with preschool children were anxious about the possibility that they might abuse their children (ÃŽÂ² = .203, p &lt; .01). Subjects who smoked were associated with anxiety about being the victim of domestic violence by their spouse (ÃŽÂ² = .154, p &lt; .05). Those whose income had decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those who were employed, and those with few rooms in their house were more likely to be dependent on the Internet (in order, ÃŽÂ² = .189, p &lt; .01; ÃŽÂ² = .196, p &lt; .01; ÃŽÂ² = -.140, p &lt; .05). Finally, mental health was impaired among those whose income was reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic (ÃŽÂ² = .134, p &lt; .05) and among those who had conflicting opinions in their families regarding the pandemic (ÃŽÂ² = .206, p &lt; .01). These results indicate that family variables are associated with family social problems. Additionally, we assume these have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While further research is required to determine the causal relationships among the variables, the findings can be used as an indicator of support that should be provided to families.","Kamoshida, Nihonmatsu, Takagi, Wakashima","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270210","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33546,""
"Bridging Knowledge Gaps in the Diagnosis and Management of Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of COVID-19","Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported as a prominent feature of postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), with common symptoms that include cognitive impairment, sleep difficulties, depression, posttraumatic stress, and substance use disorders. A primary challenge of parsing PASC epidemiology and pathophysiology is the lack of a standard definition of the syndrome, and little is known regarding mechanisms of neuropsychiatric PASC. Rates of symptom prevalence vary, but at least 1 PASC neuropsychiatric symptom has been reported in as many as 90% of patients 6 months after COVID-19 hospitalization and in approximately 25% of nonhospitalized adults with COVID-19. Mechanisms of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 are still being elucidated. They may include static brain injury accrued during acute COVID-19, neurodegeneration triggered by secondary effects of acute COVID-19, autoimmune mechanisms with chronic inflammation, viral persistence in tissue reservoirs, or reactivation of other latent viruses. Despite rapidly emerging data, many gaps in knowledge persist related to the variable definitions of PASC, lack of standardized phenotyping or biomarkers, variability in virus genotypes, ascertainment biases, and limited accounting for social determinants of health and pandemic-related stressors. Growing data support a high prevalence of PASC neuropsychiatric symptoms, but the current literature is heterogeneous with variable assessments of critical epidemiological factors. By enrolling large patient samples and conducting state-of-the-art assessments, the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER), a multicenter research initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health, will help clarify PASC epidemiology, pathophysiology, and mechanisms of injury, as well as identify targets for therapeutic intervention.","Frontera, Simon","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.1616","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33547,""
"Medical students' perceptions and performance in an online regional anatomy course during the Covid-19 pandemic","The present study evaluated the students' psychological wellbeing, experiences, performance, and perception of learning regional anatomy remotely. A regional anatomy remote learning curriculum was designed and learning materials delivered virtually to 120 undergraduate medical students at Jinan University, China. All the students consented and voluntarily participated in this study by completing self-administered online questionnaires including the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety and Depression Scales at the beginning and end of the learning session. A subset participated in focus group discussions. Most of the students (90.0 %) positively evaluated the current distance learning model. More than 80 % were satisfied with the content arrangement and coverage. Many students preferred virtual lectures (68.2 %) and videos showing dissections (70.6 %) during the distance learning sessions. However, writing laboratory reports and case-based learning were the least preferred modes of learning as they were only preferred by 23.2 % and 14.1 % of the students, respectively. There was no significant lockdown-related anxiety or depression reported by students using depression and anxiety scales as well as feedback from focus group discussions. The surveyed students' confidence scores in distance learning were significantly higher after five weeks than at the beginning of the session (3.05 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.83 vs 3.70 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.71, P &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Furthermore, the present results showed no significant differences between the current group's academic performance in the unit tests as well as the final overall evaluation for different parts of the course compared to that of the previous year's cohort. The findings above were congruent with focus group discussion data that the use of the online teaching platform for regional anatomy significantly improved the students' confidence in virtual and self-directed learning and did not negatively affect their academic performance.","Zhang, Zilundu, Fu, Zheng, Zhou, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2208","20220629","Covid-19; gross anatomy education; medical education; online learning; regional anatomy; remote teaching model; undergraduate education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33548,""
"Physical Violence and Psychological Distress Among Asian and Pacific Islander Sexual Minority Men in the United States Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> This study examined differences in self-reported physical violence and psychological distress among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) sexual minority men (SMM) before and during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (2019 vs. 2020). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We used data from 1127 AAPI SMM who completed the 2019 (August 2019-December 2019) and 2020 (August 2020-January 2021) cycles of the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS). We assessed differences in experiencing physical violence and serious psychological distress by year of survey completion. We used Poisson regression with robust variance estimation to examine whether physical violence was associated with serious psychological distress before and during COVID-19. Multivariate analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and the interaction between year and violence. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A greater percentage of AAPI SMM had serious psychological distress in 2020 during the pandemic relative to 2019 before the pandemic (56.6% vs. 35.64%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). AAPI SMM who experienced physical violence in the last 6 months were more likely to experience serious psychological distress than those who never experienced physical violence. The association between violence and psychological distress among AAPI SMM was not significantly different before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Violence against AAPI SMM in the United States is widespread. Although we did not find significant differences in exposure to physical violence among AAPI SMM before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in serious psychological distress during the pandemic among AAPI SMM may indicate heightened need of mental health services.","Lee, Katz, Kerani, Lerner, Baral, Sanchez","https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2021.0418","20220629","Asian sexual minority men; COVID-19; psychological distress; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33549,""
"Support for health care workers and psychological distress: thinking about now and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic","This study explores the relationship between emotional support, perceived risk and mental health outcomes among health care workers, who face high rates of burnout and mental distress since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, multicentred online survey of health care workers in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic evaluated coping strategies, confidence in infection control, impact of previous work during the 2003 SARS outbreak and emotional support. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the Impact of Event Scale - Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Of 3852 participants, 8.2% sought professional mental health services while 77.3% received emotional support from family, 74.0% from friends and 70.3% from colleagues. Those who felt unsupported in their work had higher odds ratios of experiencing moderate and severe symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.84-2.69), PTSD (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.58-2.25) and depression (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.57-2.25). Nearly 40% were afraid of telling family about the risks they were exposed to at work. Those who were able to share this information demonstrated lower risk of anxiety (OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.48-0.69), PTSD (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.41-0.56) and depression (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.47-0.65). Informal sources of support, including family, friends and colleagues, play an important role in mitigating distress and should be encouraged and utilized more by health care workers.

Une enquÃƒÂªte transversale a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© menÃƒÂ©e en ligne au cours de la premiÃƒÂ¨re vague de la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID-19 auprÃƒÂ¨s de travailleurs de la santÃƒÂ© de divers centres de la rÃƒÂ©gion du Grand Toronto (Ontario, Canada) pour ÃƒÂ©valuer les stratÃƒÂ©gies dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢adaptation, la confiance dans les mesures de lutte contre les infections, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢impact du travail antÃƒÂ©rieur lors de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©pidÃƒÂ©mie de SRAS survenue en 2003 et le soutien ÃƒÂ©motionnel. Les rÃƒÂ©sultats en matiÃƒÂ¨re de santÃƒÂ© mentale ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©valuÃƒÂ©s au moyen de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle du trouble dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralisÃƒÂ©e (GAD-7), de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢impact des ÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©nements Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rÃƒÂ©visÃƒÂ©e (IES-R) et du questionnaire sur la santÃƒÂ© des patients (PHQ-9). Sur les 3 852 participants, 8,2 % ont eu recours Ãƒ des services professionnels en santÃƒÂ© mentale, 77,3 % ont reÃƒÂ§u du soutien ÃƒÂ©motionnel de la part de membres de leur famille, 74,0 % de la part dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢amis et 70,3 % de la part de collÃƒÂ¨gues. Les personnes qui ne se sont pas senties soutenues dans leur travail prÃƒÂ©sentaient des probabilitÃƒÂ©s plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©es dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©prouver des symptÃƒÂ´mes dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© modÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©s et sÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨res (rapport de cotes [RC] = 2,23; intervalle de confiance [IC] Ãƒ 95 % : 1,84 Ãƒ 2,69), de trouble de stress post-traumatique (TSPT) (RC = 1,88; IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,58 Ãƒ 2,25) et de dÃƒÂ©pression (RC = 1,88; IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,57 Ãƒ 2,25). PrÃƒÂ¨s de 40 % avaient peur de parler Ãƒ leur famille des risques auxquels ils ÃƒÂ©taient exposÃƒÂ©s au travail. Ceux qui ont pu partager cette information faisaient ÃƒÂ©tat dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un risque plus faible dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© (RC = 0,58; IC Ãƒ 95 % : 0,48 Ãƒ 0,69), de TSPT (RC = 0,48; IC Ãƒ 95 % : 0,41 Ãƒ 0,56) et de dÃƒÂ©pression (RC = 0,55; IC Ãƒ 95 % : 0,47 Ãƒ 0,65). Les sources informelles de soutien, en particulier la famille, les amis et les collÃƒÂ¨gues, jouent un rÃƒÂ´le important dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢attÃƒÂ©nuation de la dÃƒÂ©tresse et devraient ÃƒÂªtre encouragÃƒÂ©es et utilisÃƒÂ©es davantage par les travailleurs de la santÃƒÂ©. Health care workers mainly used informal sources of emotional support such as family, friends and colleagues during the current COVID-19 pandemic, with fewer seeking support from mental health professionals. Those health care workers who felt confident about the effectiveness of infection control measures, and particularly organizational policies, reported less overall distress. Health care workers who felt supported had reduced rates of hypnotic medication and alcohol use. Feelings of anxiety may have affected health care workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to share information with their families about their risk of contracting COVID-19 at work. Les travailleurs de la santÃƒÂ© ont surtout eu recours Ãƒ des sources informelles de soutien ÃƒÂ©motionnel comme la famille, les amis et les collÃƒÂ¨gues pendant la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19, et un moins grand nombre dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢entre eux a sollicitÃƒÂ© le soutien de professionnels en santÃƒÂ© mentale. Les travailleurs de la santÃƒÂ© qui avaient confiance en lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢efficacitÃƒÂ© des mesures de lutte contre les infections, et particuliÃƒÂ¨rement dans les politiques organisationnelles, ont fait ÃƒÂ©tat de moins de dÃƒÂ©tresse gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale. Chez les travailleurs de la santÃƒÂ© qui se sentaient soutenus, les taux de prise de mÃƒÂ©dicaments hypnotiques et de consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool ÃƒÂ©taient plus faibles.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Mental and Behavioral Health Visits to the Emergency Department","This study aimed to describe changes in pediatric emergency department (ED) mental and behavioral health (MBH) visits before and during the early COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients aged from 5 to 17 years presenting to the pediatric ED of a major tertiary care hospital with MBH-related concerns from March 2017 to September 2020. We evaluated trends in MBH ED visits over the study period, specifically comparing patient demographics, diagnosis categories, and ED disposition between the pre-COVID (2019) and COVID (2020) periods using pairwise Pearson Ãâ€¡2 analyses with reported odds ratios (ORs) in SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Of 8093 MBH-related visits, 58.5% were females, 85.4% were adolescents, and 62.7% self-identified as non-Hispanic. The proportion of MBH-related ED visits increased from 3.8% to 7.5% over the study period (P &lt; 0.0001). Although total MBH visits decreased by 17.3% from 2019 to 2020, there was a proportionate increase in MBH-to-total-ED visits, representing a 42.8% increase through 2019. Compared with 2019, there was a proportionate increase in MBH-related ED visits by females (10.6%, P &lt; 0.0001), older adolescents (18.2%, P &lt; 0.0001), and non-Hispanic patients (6.1%, P = 0.017) in 2020. The MBH visits in 2020 were more likely related to suicidality/self-harm (OR, 1.2; confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.4) or substance use (OR, 1.4; CI, 1.1-1.9). Compared with 2019, there were significantly higher odds of admission (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.3-2.1) or transfer for inpatient psychiatric care (OR, 1.8; CI, 1.6-2.1) in 2020. Our data suggest that the early COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on MBH-related ED visits. Compared with 2019, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of MBH-to-total-ED visits primarily affecting older adolescent, non-Hispanic girls with suicidality/self-harm and substance-related disorders in 2020, despite an overall decrease in the number of MBH visits during this period. There was also an increase in the proportion of visits resulting in admission or transfer for inpatient psychiatric care in 2020.","Bolt, Patel, Stone, Pandian, Manuel, Gaines","https://doi.org/10.1097/PEC.0000000000002794","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33551,""

"The impact of severe COVID-19 on health-related quality of life and disability: an early follow-up perspective","To assess early postdischarge health-related quality of life and disability of all survivors of critical COVID-19 admitted for more than 24 hours to na intensive care unit.. Study carried out at the Intensive Care Medicine Department of Centro Hospitalar UniversitÃƒÂ¡rio SÃƒÂ£o JoÃƒÂ£o from 8th October 2020 to 16th February 2021. Approximately 1 month after hospital discharge, an intensive care-trained nurse performed a telephone consultation with 99 survivors already at home applying the EuroQol Five-Dimensional Five-Level questionnaire and the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. The mean age of the population studied was 63 Ã‚Â± 12 years, and 32.5% were submitted to invasive mechanical ventilation. Their mean Simplified Acute Physiologic Score was 35 Ã‚Â± 14, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index was 3 Ã‚Â± 2. Intensive care medicine and hospital lengths of stay were 13 Ã‚Â± 22 and 22 Ã‚Â± 25 days, respectively. The mean EuroQol Visual Analog Scale was 65% (Ã‚Â± 21), and only 35.3% had no or slight problems performing their usual activities, most having some degree of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 showed marked impairments in terms of reassuring usual work or community activities and mobility. The use of both tools suggested that their health status was worse than their perception of it.

"Cyberchondria, Covid-19 phobia, and well-being: a relational study on teachers","This study aims at investigating level and contributor factors of Cyberchondria, Covid-19-related Phobia, and Well-Being in a sample of teachers in Turkey. The study was conducted on teachers (n=1000) working in a province in eastern Turkey. Data for the study were collected using a form that included participants' descriptive characteristics, the Covid-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-SE), the Cyberchondria Severity Scale, and the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Spearman correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal Wallis analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. As participant's cyberchondria levels rose, C19P-SE scores increased (r=0.271, p&lt;0.001), and WHO-5 scores decreased (r=-0.224, p&lt;0.05). Corona-phobia was higher in those who used social media than in those who did not (p&lt;0.05). Cyberchondria scale scores were higher among those who had taken medications without a physician's recommendation during the pandemic. Participants who had a disabled person or a person in need of care in their household had higher scores for distrust of the physician and C19P-SE than for the cyberchondria severity scale sub-dimension, and the WHO-5 mean scores were lower (p&lt;0.001, P=0.016, and P=0.020, respectively). The study results show that increasing levels of cyberchondria trigger Covid-19 phobias in teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic and negatively affect their well-being. This descriptive study can help understand the risk group for cyberchondria, the influencing factors, and the health and economic consequences, and identify strategies for effective combating with cyberchondria.","KarakaÃ…Å¸, Tekin, Bentli, Demir","https://doi.org/10.23749/mdl.v113i3.12661","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33554,""
"The Use and Safety of Leave From an Acute Inpatient Psychiatry Unit: A Retrospective Review of Pass Outcomes for 4 Years","Leave passes provide authorized leave for hospitalized patients from a psychiatric inpatient unit. Although providing day passes was once a relatively common practice, there are relatively few data describing their safety and efficacy. This descriptive study examines the use of leave passes in an adult inpatient unit at a university hospital between 2017 and 2021, with attention to reasons for granting the day pass, duration, and outcome of the pass. During the study period, 10 patients with primary psychotic or mood disorders received 12 passes for housing coordination, COVID-19 vaccination, or major family events. There were no fatalities or abscondments. One patient experienced severe agitation and engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior. A second patient showed mild, redirectable psychomotor agitation upon return to the unit. The remaining 10 passes were uneventful. Our findings support the view that patients with diverse diagnoses can safely be provided leave from an inpatient setting with adequate planning and support, yielding a low incidence of adverse events.","Hristidis, CÃƒÂ¡ceda, Kim, Bronson, Hill","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001482","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33555,""
"Baseline eHealth Behaviors of Service Members: A Retrospective, Cross-Sectional Analysis of Patient Portal Use Before the Pandemic","The use of electronic health (eHealth) tools has the potential to support the overall health, wellness, fitness status, and ability to deploy worldwide of active duty service members (SMs). Additionally, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic forced healthcare organizations to quickly convert to virtual care settings to decrease face-to-face interactions and increase access to healthcare using technology. The shift to virtual care and the push to increase use of eHealth tools heightened the need to understand how military members interact with eHealth tools. Little is known about the factors that influence SMs use of eHealth tools and if having a health condition increases or decreases use. To evaluate these factors, we completed a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis on a sample of 198,388 active duty SMs aged 18 to 68Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. We used two Military Health System (MHS) data sources-Tricare Online (TOL) Patient Portal 2018 audit logs and outpatient electronic health record data. Using eHealth behaviors identified in the audit logs, we evaluated and compared individual characteristics (i.e., ""gender"", ""age"", ""race"", and ""marital status""), environmental factors (i.e., ""rank"", ""military branch"", and ""geographic location""), and six available health conditions (i.e., congenital health defects, amputation, anxiety, sleep, traumatic brain injury, and depression). Since moderate usage of eHealth tools is linked to improved health outcomes, adherence, communication, and increased consumer satisfaction, a logistic regression model was developed to find the factors most associated with moderate (3-11 logins per year) use of the portal. Electronic health use increased by SMs with underlying health conditions or if they were managing family member health. Most SMs who used the TOL Patient Portal were of ages 25-34Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, White, and married. The mean age is 32.53 for males and 29.98 for females. Over half of the TOL Patient Portal SM users utilized the portal one to two times. Most SMs used the TOL Patient Portal in Virginia, Texas, California, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland. The highest use was during the months of March to May. Frequent patient portal actions include searching for appointments, viewing health information, viewing medical encounters, and refilling medications. Although SMs with congenital health defects, anxiety, sleep issues, and depression have higher patient portal use rates, SMs with depression have a negative association with using the patient portal at a ""moderate"" rate. Viewing family member health information and searching for appointments were strongly associated with patient portal moderate use. Our findings support top military initiatives to improve the overall health, wellness, and readiness of SMs while decreasing the MHS's overall cost of care while providing a foundation to compare ""pre"" and ""post"" pandemic eHealth behaviors. It is essential to note that SMs are more likely to use a patient portal to seek information or manage family member health. This key factor identifies the significance of family health promotion and readiness in the active duty SM's life. The long-term goal of our study is to build the foundation for delivering tailored health information and eHealth tools to promote health and readiness-centric patient engagement.","Raps, Chen, Bakken, Caban, Engler","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac168","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33556,""

In this cross-sectional online survey, a standard Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9) was completed by 228 ophthalmologists who were practicing in Iran. The PHQ- 9 questionnaire was revised by adding two additional questions specifically applicable for the assessment of the psychological impact of coronavirus disease on the Iranian ophthalmologists. An organized classification regarding the assessment of different depression severities identified as no (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), or severe (15-21) was then considered for data analysis. The mean age of our participants was 49.0 <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mo>Ã‚Â±</mml:mo></mml:math> 15.61 years and the majority of them (67.1%) were male.

"The prevalence and risk factors of death anxiety and fear of COVID-19 in an Iranian community: A cross-sectional study","COVID-19 has adversely impacted the public's mental health. One of the causes of psychopathology during the present pandemic is death anxiety and fear of COVID-19. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of death anxiety and fear of COVID-19 in Shiraz city, south of Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 982 participants in Shiraz from October to November 2021. Data were collected using Templer's Death Anxiety Scale and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Trained interviewers collected data throughout different city districts. A data-driven approach (latent class analysis) was applied to categorize the participants and determine the risk factors. Among the participants, 507 (51.6%) were female, and 475 (48.4%) were male. The participants' mean age was 38.26Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.16 years. Based on the analysis, 259 (26.4%), 512 (52.1%), and 211 (21.5%) participants had low, moderate, and severe levels of death anxiety. Also, 393 (40.06%) and 588 (59.94%) of the participants had low and high levels of fear, respectively. Higher death anxiety was significantly associated with being female, having an associate degree, being retired, share of medical expenditure from total expenditure of more than 10%, having a history of hospital admission due to COVID-19, history of COVID-19 in relatives, and having fear of COVID-19. Also, being female, expenses equal to income, history of hospital admission due to COVID-19, death in relatives, and higher death anxiety were linked to higher levels of fear of COVID-19. Death anxiety and fear of COVID-19 are closely associated with each other and affected by various sociodemographic and economic factors.

"Natural selection plays a significant role in governing the codon usage bias in the novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC)","The ongoing prevailing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is becoming one of the major global health concerns worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes spike (S) glycoprotein that plays a very crucial role in viral entry into the host cell <i>via</i> binding of its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 genome results in more severe and transmissible variants characterized by the emergence of novel mutations called 'variants of concern' (VOC). The currently designated alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron VOC are the focus of this study due to their high transmissibility, increased virulence, and concerns for decreased effectiveness of the available vaccines. In VOC, the spike (S) gene and other non-structural protein mutations may affect the efficacies of the approved COVID-19 vaccines. To understand the diversity of SARS-CoV-2, several studies have been performed on a limited number of sequences. However, only a few studies have focused on codon usage bias (CUBs) pattern analysis of all the VOC strains. Therefore, to evaluate the evolutionary divergence of all VOC S-genes, we performed CUBs analysis on 300,354 sequences to understand the evolutionary relationship with its adaptation in different hosts, <i>i.e</i>., humans, bats, and pangolins. Base composition and RSCU analysis revealed the presence of 20 preferred AU-ended and 10 under-preferred GC-ended codons. In addition, CpG was found to be depleted, which may be attributable to the adaptive response by viruses to escape from the host defense process. Moreover, the ENC values revealed a higher bias in codon usage in the VOC S-gene. Further, the neutrality plot analysis demonstrated that S-genes analyzed in this study are under 83.93% influence of natural selection, suggesting its pivotal role in shaping the CUBs. The CUBs pattern of S-genes was found to be very similar among all the VOC strains. Interestingly, we observed that VOC strains followed a trend of antagonistic codon usage with respect to the human host. The identified CUBs divergence would help to understand the virus evolution and its host adaptation, thus help design novel vaccine strategies against the emerging VOC strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for identifying the evolution of CUBs pattern in all the currently identified VOC.","Tyagi, Sardar, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13562","20220629","Codon usage bias; Mutational pressure; Natural selection; SARS-CoV-2; Variants of concern (VOC)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33560,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 control measures on rural households' access to social capital for mobilizing resources in Eastern Ethiopia","Physical distancing and mobility restriction measures are used as central components of the COVID 19 response globally. In Ethiopia, the measures have been implemented against a complex social structure wherein social support practices (in the form of social capital) and daily social interactions are embedded. However, the mechanism of how such measures interact with various social capital practices and shape household access to various types of resources during the pandemic are less understood. This study examined the way the COVID-19 pandemic and protective measures shaped smallholder farmers' access to social capital for mobilizing resources during the pandemic. A total of 176 households were randomly selected for the quantitative survey. In addition, 25 key informant interviews were collected. Results show that prolonged physical distancing and mobility restrictions imposed to control the health impact of the pandemic have disrupted normal patterns of social interactions and resource sharing between households. The imposed measures significantly decreased households' access to food, information, credit/loan, labor, psychological support, and agricultural inputs and extension services. The study strongly suggests that the public health measure imposed for the COVID-19 prevention and control affect the proper functioning of a society's social capital framework, thereby, reducing poor households' ability to deal with socio-economic crises and uncertainties. This implies that ongoing as well as future responses to the pandemic should adapt and integrate crisis management measures with the local risk-sharing mechanisms such as indigenous mutual support frameworks and processes. Harnessing inclusive social protection programs and building strong rural financial infrastructure and agricultural service delivery can help vulnerable households cope with shocks, improve the effectiveness of pandemic responses and facilitate post-crisis recovery.","Endris, Wordofa, Awoke, Hassen, Hussein, Ebrahim, Hashim, Ahmed, Okoyo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01258","20220629","COVID-19; Ethiopia; access to resources; protective measures; social capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33561,""
"A pilot randomized controlled trial of supervised, at-home, self-administered transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) to manage long COVID symptoms","Background Although the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has now impacted the world for over two years, the persistent secondary neuropsychiatric effects are still not fully understood. These ""long COVID"" symptoms, also referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), can persist for months after infection without any effective treatments. Long COVID involves a complex heterogenous symptomology and can lead to disability and limit work. Long COVID symptoms may be due to sustained inflammatory responses and prolonged immune response after infection. Interestingly, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may have anti-inflammatory effects, however, until recently, VNS could not be self-administered, at-home, noninvasively. Methods We created a double-blind, noninvasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) system that can be self-administered at home with simultaneous remote monitoring of physiological biomarkers and video supervision by study staff. Subsequently, we carried out a pilot (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13) randomized, sham-controlled, trial with this system for four weeks to treat nine predefined long covid symptoms (anxiety, depression, vertigo, anosmia, ageusia, headaches, fatigue, irritability, brain fog). No in-person patient contact was needed, with informed consent, trainings, ratings, and all procedures being conducted remotely during the pandemic (2020-2021) and equipment being shipped to individuals' homes. This trial was registered onClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier: NCT04638673. Results Four-weeks of at-home self-administered taVNS (two, one-hour sessions daily, delivered at suprathreshold intensities) was feasible and safe. Although our trial was not powered to determine efficacy as an intervention in a heterogenous population, the trends in the data suggest taVNS may have a mild to moderate effect in reducing mental fatigue symptoms in a subset of individuals. This innovative study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of supervised self-administered taVNS under a fully contactless protocol and suggests that future studies can safely investigate this novel form of brain stimulation at-home for a variety of neuropsychiatric and motor recovery applications.","Badran, Huffman, Dancy, Austelle, Bikson, Kautz, George","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1716096/v1","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33562,""

"Non-enzymatic electrochemical sensing of dopamine from COVID-19 quarantine person","The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, is not only a great threat to the victim life but it is leaving invisible devastating negative affect on mental health of quarantined individual because of isolation, depression, bereavement, and loss of income. Therefore, the precise monitoring catecholamine neurotransmitters specifically of dopamine (DA) is of great importance to assess the mental health. Thus, herein we have synthesized Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) through solvothermal method for precise monitoring of DA. To facilitate the fast transportation of ions, highly conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene; PEDOT) has been integrated on the surface of ZIF-67 which not only provides the smooth pathway for ions/electrons transportation but also saves the electrode from pulverization. The fabricated ZIF-67/PEDOT electrode shows a significant sensing performance towards DA detection in terms of short diffusion pathways by expositing more active sites, over good linear range (15-240ÃŽÂ¼M) and a low detection limit of (0.04ÃŽÂ¼M) even in the coexistence of the potentially interfering molecules. The developed ZIF-67/PEDOT sensor was successfully employed for sensitive and selective monitoring of DA from COVID-19 quarantined person blood, thus suggesting reliability of the developed electrode.","Masood, Asad, Riaz, Akhtar, Hayat, Shenashen, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.126451","20220629","COVID-19; Dopamine; PEDOT; Quarantine; ZIF-67","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33564,""
"Undergraduate Student Stress, Sleep, and Health Before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduate students experienced sleep problems and mental health issues that were negatively associated with academic achievement. Studies comparing undergraduate sleep and health pre- to mid-pandemic have yielded mixed results, necessitating additional research on other cohorts and examination of potential moderators. The present study was conducted to examine whether American undergraduate students tested mid-pandemic experienced poorer sleep, health, and academic achievement relative to students tested pre-pandemic, as well as to examine whether poor sleep during the pandemic was preferentially associated with poorer health in women. The current cross-sectional study included 217 participants tested pre-pandemic (February-December 2019) and a separate sample of 313 participants tested mid-pandemic (November-December 2020). Participants in both samples provided demographic information and completed questionnaires inquiring about participant sleep quality, insomnia, and cumulative grade point average (GPA); participants in the mid-pandemic sample also reported on measures of general, physical, and mental health. Participants tested mid-pandemic reported poorer global sleep quality, greater insomnia severity, greater stress, and higher cumulative GPAs relative to participants tested pre-pandemic. For the mid-pandemic sample only, poorer sleep quality was associated with reduced physical health; interactions indicated that women with poor sleep quality reported poorer mental health relative to both women with good sleep quality and men with poor quality sleep. Perceived stress mediated the association between sleep problems and GPA. These findings indicate that the pandemic negatively impacted the functioning of undergraduate students and highlights the need for future studies examining additional moderators of the reported effects.","Lukowski, Karayianis, Kamliot, Tsukerman","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2022.2085651","20220629","Pandemic; health; sleep; stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33565,""
"The impact of consecutive COVID-19 lockdowns in England on mental wellbeing in people with inflammatory arthritis","During the first UK COVID-19 lockdown, studies identified over half of inflammatory arthritis (IA) patients in the UK reported a worsening of emotional distress. Given the prolonged nature of the pandemic, and the strict 'shielding' restrictions imposed on 'extremely clinically vulnerable' populations, it is likely that the implementation of the second lockdown period in England, during November 2020, may also have had a negative impact on the mental health of IA patients. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore the impact of consecutive lockdown periods on mental wellbeing in people with IA. Nine IA patients took part in semi-structured telephone interviews at both baseline (June/July 2020) and follow-up (November 2020). The interview schedule, which was developed and piloted with a Patient Research Partner, explored patient experiences and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown periods. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Five males and four females, with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or spondylarthritis, aged between 24-79Ã‚Â years (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49.9, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.9) were included in the sample. Four main themes impacting on mental wellbeing were identified from the data: (1) Pandemic fatigue versus pandemic acclimatisation, (2) Social interaction and isolation, (3) Clarity of information, (4) Seasonal changes. The first two COVID-19 lockdown periods in England had an ongoing impact on the mental health of patients with IA. Healthcare professionals, in conjunction with government support, should ensure that adequate information and mental health resources are available to support IA patients during periods of ongoing restrictions, whilst also continuing to encourage behaviours which promote good mental health and wellbeing.","Caton, Chaplin, Carpenter, Sweeney, Tung, de Souza, Galloway, Nikiphorou, Norton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41927-022-00266-y","20220628","COVID-19; Inflammatory arthritis; Mental health; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33566,""
"Analysis of mHealth research: mapping the relationship between mobile apps technology and healthcare during COVID-19 outbreak","Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) offer enormous promise for illness monitoring and treatment to improve the provided medical care and promote health and wellbeing. We applied bibliometric quantitative analysis and network visualization to highlight research trends and areas of particular interest. We expect by summarizing the trends in mHealth app research, our work will serve as a roadmap for future investigations. Relevant English publications were extracted from the Scopus database. VOSviewer (version 1.6.17) was used to build coauthorship networks of authors, countries, and the co-occurrence networks of author keywords. We analyzed 550 published articles on mHealth apps from 2020 to February 1, 2021. The yearly publications increased from 130 to 390 in 2021. JMIR mHealth and uHealth (33/550, 6.0%), J. Med. Internet Res. (27/550, 4.9%), JMIR Res. Protoc. (22/550, 4.0%) were the widest journals for these publications. The United States has the largest number of publications (143/550, 26.0%), and England ranks second (96/550, 17.5%). The top three productive authors were: Giansanti D., Samuel G., Lucivero F., and Zhang L. Frequent authors' keywords have formed major 4 clusters representing the hot topics in the field: (1) artificial intelligence and telehealthcare; (2) digital contact tracing apps, privacy and security concerns; (3) mHealth apps and mental health; (4) mHealth apps in public health and health promotion. mHealth apps undergo current developments, and they remain hot topics in COVID-19.

"Explaining the challenges and adaptation strategies of nurses in caring for patients with COVID-19: a qualitative study in Iran","Nurses, as the primary human resource in the fight against COVID-19, encounter several obstacles and concerns. As a result, the current study used a qualitative method to describe the problems and adaptation techniques of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. The current study used a qualitative conventional content analysis technique with 30 nurses working in COVID-19 wards in Tehran hospitals. Purposive sampling, snowball sampling, and semi-structured interviews were used to get access to participants and gather data. The data was examined using conventional qualitative content analysis and the MAXQDA-18 program. To assess the quality of study findings, Guba and Lincoln's trustworthiness criteria were fulfilled. The data analysis revealed two main categories and sixteen subcategories: (1) experiences and challenges (lack of protective equipment, high work pressure, marginalized physical health, problems related to the use of protective equipment, being excluded, a lack of a supportive work environment, problems related to patients, psychological problems, fear, marginalized personal and family life, and the challenge of communicating with patients' families); and (2) adaptation strategies for work conditions (performing religious-spiritual activities, creating an empathetic atmosphere in the workplace, spiritualizing their work, trying to convince the family and gaining their support, and strengthening their sense of self-worth and responsibility). Nurses' working conditions can be improved by providing adequate protective equipment, a suitable work environment, and more social and financial support; paying more attention to nurses' physical and mental health; and considering appropriate communication mechanisms for nurses to communicate with their families and patients' families.","Irandoost, Yoosefi Lebni, Safari, Khorami, Ahmadi, Soofizad, Ebadi Fard Azar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-00937-8","20220628","Adaptation strategies; COVID-19; Challenges; Coronavirus; Nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33568,""
"Psychological reactions to the coronavirus pandemic: a comparative study of Holocaust survivors and other older adults in Israel","The current study examines psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults living in Israel. Based on the 'life events, stress, coping and health theory,' we hypothesized that due to their traumatic early life history and dearth of emotional and physical coping resources, Holocaust survivors would be more vulnerable than other older adults to the negative effects of this difficult and prolonged life event on their mental health. Based on structured questionnaires with closed questions, we interviewed 306 Holocaust survivors and non-survivors aged 75Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°during the COVID-19 pandemic. Univariate data analysis showed that Holocaust survivors had fewer coping resources in terms of health status and educational level than non-survivors. As expected, Holocaust survivors also reported a greater extent of COVID-19-related anxiety, and more depression, which worsened during the pandemic. However, both groups did not differ in their will to live, which is an indicator of general well-being and commitment to continue living. In multivariate analyses conducted to explain COVID-19 anxiety in the entire sample and separately on each of the two groups, the best explanatory variables were other psychological variables especially increased depression. It seems that Holocaust survivors are more emotionally vulnerable to the pandemic's negative effects than other older adults, in support of the 'life events, stress, coping and health theory,'Ã‚Â but despite this, they show resilience in their will to continue living. Policy makers and practitioners are recommended to identify Holocaust survivors and other vulnerable older people and investigate their specific needs. Interventions should include practices for maintaining and boosting resilience and well-being by increasing appropriate emotional and cognitive internal and external coping resources, especially during prolonged periods of hardship.","Carmel, Bachner, Cohn-Schwartz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04052-5","20220628","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping resources; Holocaust survivors; Mental health; Older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33569,""

"Trait Versus State Predictors of Emotional Distress Symptoms: The Role of the Big-5 Personality Traits, Metacognitive Beliefs, and Strategies","To enhance formulation and interventions for emotional distress symptoms, research should aim to identify factors that contribute to distress and disorder. One way to formulate emotional distress symptoms is to view them as state manifestations of underlying personality traits. However, the metacognitive model suggests that emotional distress is maintained by metacognitive strategies directed by underlying metacognitive beliefs. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the role of these factors as predictors of anxiety and depression symptoms in a cross-sectional sample of 4936 participants collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personality traits (especially neuroticism) were linked to anxiety and depression, but metacognitive beliefs and strategies accounted for additional variance. Among the predictors, metacognitive strategies accounted for the most variance in symptoms. Furthermore, we evaluated two statistical models based on personality traits versus metacognitions and found that the latter provided the best fit. Thus, these findings indicate that emotional distress symptoms are maintained by metacognitive strategies that are better accounted for by metacognitions compared with personality traits. Theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","Nordahl, Ebrahimi, Hoffart, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001557","20220628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","",33572,""
"How do underserved adolescents want to learn about health? An exploration of health concerns, preferences, and resources utilized","Understanding health concerns and preferences of underserved adolescents has potential to shape health interventions. The objective of this study is to better understand these adolescents' current and preferred health resources, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. High school students from underrepresented communities in six US cities completed a pre-pipeline program survey in which they reported level of personal concern, as well as current and preferred sources of information about 1) depression/anxiety, 2) nutrition, 3) sexual health, 4) trauma/violence, and 5) alcohol/drugs. 259 participants completed the survey (avg. age 15.7, 79% female, 58.3% Hispanic, and 36.0% Black). At least a moderate level of concern and some degree of prior knowledge (&gt;3 on 5-point Likert scale) were reported across all health topics. Participants reported the lowest level of knowledge on the topic of trauma/violence. Students reported family (24%) and teachers (21%) as the most utilized current sources of information. Students reported doctors as the preferred source of information across all health topics. The difference between students' current source of information and preferred source of information was significant across four topics: depression/anxiety, sexual health, trauma, and alcohol/drugs (p &lt;0.01). These results underscore the important role of physicians as educators and suggest a need for improved education on trauma/violence. These results also establish a pre-COVID-19 baseline for adolescent health concerns, current, and preference health resources.
