"Operational Guidance for K-12 Schools and Early Care and Education Programs to Support Safe In-Person Learning","Summary of Recent Changes Removed the recommendation to cohort Changed recommendation to conduct screening testing to focus on high-risk activities during high COVID-19 Community Level or in response to an outbreak Removed the recommendation to quarantine, except in high-risk congregate settings Removed information about Test to Stay Added detailed information on when to wear a mask, managing cases and exposures, and responding to outbreaks On This Page Introduction Strategies for Everyday Operations COVID-19 Community Levels and Associated Prevention Strategies Considerations for Prioritizing Strategies Introduction Schools and early care and education (ECE) programs are an important part of the infrastructure of communities as they provide safe, supportive learning environments for students and children and enable parents and caregivers to be at work. Schools and ECE programs like Head Start also provide critical services that help to mitigate health disparities, such as school lunch programs, and social, physical, behavioral, and mental health services. This guidance can help K-12 schools and ECE programs remain open and help their administrators support safe, in-person learning while reducing the spread of COVID-19. Based on the COVID-19 Community Levels, this guidance provides flexibility so schools and ECE programs can adapt to changing local situations, including periods of increased community health impacts from COVID-19. K-12 schools and ECE programs (e.g., center-based child care, family child care, Head Start, or other early learning, early intervention and preschool/pre-kindergarten programs delivered in schools, homes, or other settings) should put in place a core set of infectious disease prevention strategies as part of their normal operations. The addition and layering of COVID-19-specific prevention strategies should be tied to the COVID-19 Community Levels and community or setting-specific context, such as availability of resources, health status of students, and age of population served. Enhanced prevention strategies also may be necessary in response to an outbreak in the K-12 or ECE setting. This CDC guidance is meant to supplementâ€”not replaceâ€”any federal, state, tribal, local, or territorial health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools and ECE programs must comply. Schools and ECE programs play critical roles in promoting equity in learning and health, particularly for groups disproportionately affected by COVID-19. People living in rural areas, people with disabilities, immigrants, and people who identify as American Indian/Alaska Native, Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. These disparities have also emerged among children. School and ECE administrators and public health officials can promote equity in learning and health by demonstrating to families, teachers, and staff that comprehensive prevention strategies are in place to keep students, staff, families, and school communities safe and provide supportive environments for in-person learning. Though this guidance is written for COVID-19 prevention, many of the layered prevention strategies described in this guidance can help prevent the spread of other infectious diseases, such as influenza (flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and norovirus, and support healthy learning environments for all. The next section describes everyday preventive actions that schools and ECE programs can take.

"Separation, connection, and the anticipation of uncertain (digital) futures: Care, COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health","This chapter will explore a spatio-temporal approach to psychological experience to frame some of the potential impacts of the Covid-19 'Lockdown'. Albert Camus's The Plague stated that the greatest suffering of the book's plague was separation, and yet the current Covid-19-enforced lockdown differs significantly from Camus' fictional plague as the powers to connect are far greater in today's 'digital age'. Moreover, the lockdown itself acts as a 'great connector' through being a global event eliciting new shared feelings, in which strands of individuality give way to the emergence of new collective histories. The connective power of the shared feelings elicited by global lockdowns presents challenges for imagining futures, with so much uncertainty existing as to the shape of the post-pandemic world. This chapter asks what we need to consider when imagining forms of future care might motivate life after the lockdown, with reference to the field of mental health.

"After lockdown, opening up: Psychosocial transformation in the wake of COVID-19","This edited volume examines the psychosocial transformations experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, and envisions those that might lead to a more equitable society as we 'open up'. The book integrates psychoanalysis, sociology, cultural studies, and psychology to address three main areas: personal experiences of the lockdown, new formations of power and desire that the lockdown has shaped, and global concerns related to the pandemic. Within those three areas, the chapters discuss key themes that include the uses of space during lockdown;experiences of death, loss, and domestic violence;race and the pandemic;technology, media, and viral media;chronic illness;handwashing and COVID-19;and conspiracy theories. Drawing together academics and practitioners with a common vision of social justice and active pedagogy, the contents of this volume combine experiential writing with cutting-edge, theoretically-informed interdisciplinary debates. The book advances and demonstrates the productive diversity of psychosocial studies, drawing on psychoanalytic theories, critical psychologies, critical theories, critical race theories, process philosophies, affect theories, and critical pedagogy. In doing so, it will appeal to scholars across the social sciences.

"A psychological behavioral survey among medical students during the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019","Objective: To evaluate the psychological status of medical students after the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COV1D - 19) in order to provide necessary psychological assistance. Methods The respondents were medical students from Zhongshan School of Medicine and Affiliated Hospitals of Sun Yat - scn University. A survey platform Wenjuanxing was used to design the questionnaire. The responding time ranged from Feb 1st 2020 to Feb 8th 2020. SPSS 25.0 and performed the binary Logistic multivariate regression analysis were used to investigate how demographic characteristics and other factors influence medical students' psychological status. Results The number of respondents was 1 244, and the valid samples were 1 209.55.1% of medical students checked the epidemic report one to three times per day. Most medical students did not suffer from depression or anxiety. only 0.7%-12.4% had symptoms for ""more than half of the time"", and 0.2%-5.4% had symptoms ""nearly every day"". Among students with symptoms, 24.5% relieved within one week, 4.8% within two weeks and 0.8% within three weeks, while only 6.3% had persistent symptoms. Suspending classes had no perceivable influence on psychological status in 37.6% of respondents and had only a little influence on 35.3% of them. The percentage of affected nudes was 32.6%, and that for females was 44.9% (f1/40.05). Undergraduate students had the least proportion (37.4%) of being psychologically influenced, while master students had the most proportion (411.7%), the difference was statistically significant (1/40.05). 56.5% of students with mild anxiety or depression tendency had psychological influence, while the percentage of students with moderate, moderate-severe, severe were 80.0%, 73.7%, and 85.7%, respectively. the difference was statistically significant (11/40.05). During the epidemic period, the active learners were less often affected than the students who did not study, the percentage being 38.0% and 44.5%, respectively, the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05""). Conclusion After the outbreak of COVID-19, the psychological status of medical students is normal, but the psychological behavior of a few medical students has undergone negative changes. High-risk groups need special psychological intervention. Counselors and class teachers should strengthen the contact with this class of students to avoid negative emotions from adversely affecting the psychological behavior of medical students.","Zhang, XueHui, Ye, TianTian, Yao, LiJuan, Song, LanGui, Wu, ZhongDao","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+psychological+behavioral+survey+among+medical+students+during+the+outbreak+of+Coronavirus+disease+2019","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Tropical Medicine; 20(5):576-580, 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36834,""
"Exploring COVID-19 circuit breaker (CB) restrictions at a migrant worker dormitory in Singapore: a case study and nested mixed-method analysis of stress management and mental health","Introduction Measures to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker dormitories in Singapore included lockdown and isolation of residents for prolonged periods. In this paper, we explore efforts to ease tensions and support mental health under these conditions. Methods Case study of dormitory residents under lockdown from April to August 2020 comprises a nested mixed-method approach using an online questionnaire (n=175) and semistructured interviews (n=23) of migrant workers sampled from the survey (August to September 2020). Logistic regression models were used to analyse survey data. Semistructured interviews were analysed using applied thematic analysis. Results Survey and interview data showed that mental health was largely protected despite initial rising tensions over restrictions during lockdown. Sources of tension negatively affecting low stress responses included job related worries, OR=0.07 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.18, p&lt;0.001), poor communication with employers, OR=0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.44, p&lt;0.001) and loneliness, OR=0.24 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.55, p&lt;0.001). Interview narratives concurrently revealed themes around job insecurity and the effects of the lockdown â€˜not being good for mind and bodyâ€™, the imposition of new rules and regulations compounded by the most emphasised concernâ€”worry about family back home. Interviewees shared how their adaptive capability played a pivotal protective role alongside social support and solidarity;aided by regular use of messaging applications, which supported mental health, OR=4.81 (95% CI 1.54 to 15.21, p&lt;0.01). Employers were described as central to alleviating tensions, providing feedback loops to improve dorm conditions. Employees feeling their employers cared about their health and well-being was especially protective to mental health, OR=17.24 (95% CI 4.00 to 85.74, p&lt;0.001). Gratitude and trust in government and healthcare provision was widely acknowledged. Concurrently, related attitudes such as believing in the timeliness and appropriateness of the lockdown also protected mental health, OR 2.85 (95% CI 1.08 to 7.39, p=0.03). Conclusion Tensions are mapped to protective solutions informing guidelines for future outbreak stress management response.","Wong, Melvyn Chung Pheng, Tan, Chuen Seng, Chan, Alyssa Yenyi, Khaled, Nazrana, Hasan, Md Tahmid, Panchapakesan, Chitra, Tripathi, Shilpi, Afsana, Kaosar, Lwin, May O.; Chen, Mark I.

"Contextual Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pregnant Womenâ€™s Emotional Regulation Abilities Influence du contexte de la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 sur les capacitÃ©s de rÃ©gulation Ã©motionnelle des femmes enceintes","Introduction: Emotional regulation is a key factor that could determine the quality of becoming a parent. Since pregnancy is accompanied by changes in the emotional system, fluctuations in emotional regulation may also occur during this period. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had major psychological repercussions on the general population which could have also affected emotional regulation capacities. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether emotional regulation has characteristics during pregnancy and to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the emotional regulation of pregnant women. Method: One hundred fifty-one women aged between 19 and 42 years old participated in this study. Their emotional regulation abilities were assessed using the Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale before and during the pandemic. A two-factor multivariate analysis of covariance, ""parental status"" (pregnant vs. childless) and ""time of data collection"" (before vs. during COVID-19), was conducted to compare the emotional regulation abilities of pregnant women with those of childless women before and during the pandemic. Results: (1) Prior to the pandemic, pregnant women exhibited better emotional regulation skills than childless women, characterized by greater acceptance and understanding of their emotions. (2) During the pandemic: (a) pregnant womenâ€™s emotional regulation scores were comparable to those of women without children. (b) They also had more difficulty than pre-pandemic pregnant women in identifying their emotions. Conclusion: The lack of improvement in emotional regulation skills in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic is a specific impact of COVID on this population. This could affect their mental health, as well as the emotional adjustment of the mother towards her baby.","Toleon, Camille, Deborde, Anne-Sophie, Ahmad, Sam, Vanwalleghem, StÃ©phanie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Contextual+Influence+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Pregnant+Womenâ€™s+Emotional+Regulation+Abilities+Influence+du+contexte+de+la+pandÃ©mie+de+COVID-19+sur+les+capacitÃ©s+de+rÃ©gulation+Ã©motionnelle+des+femmes+enceintes","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: L'Encephale;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36836,""
"Emotions in educators implementing a social-emotional development framework","This qualitative study explored the emotions of early childhood educators implementing the Pyramid Model social-emotional framework. The semi-structured interviews with 11 educators included discussing emotions correlated to Pyramid Model practices and organizational-level practices. The data suggested that patterns aligned with Roger's (1962) diffusion of innovation theory. Emotional patterns emerged as unpleasant and high-intensity emotions such as stress and frustration, unpleasant and low-intensity emotions such as disappointment and sadness, pleasant and high-intensity emotions such as excitement, joy, and hope, pleasant and low-intensity emotions such as content and calm. Specific Pyramid Model practices and organizational interactions also created barriers and patterns of stress. The patterns suggested that focusing on support for coaching and leadership and specific barriers such as buy-in and staff turnover may have an impact on the success or abandonment of the framework implementation. Educators also indicated a continued need for support due to the global pandemic COVID-19.

"â€˜Mutual aid is present in every crisisâ€™: An Interview with Dean Spade","The Covid-19 pandemic unravelled a crisis of the modern state, and its legal institutions on the one hand, and on the other hand of our interpretive framesâ€”both philosophical and scientific. It is here that the idea and practice of mutual aid gains significance, both to think about how we can respond to acute crises of planetary scales as well as to the crisis of critique in the discipline of law. The task of mutual aid is not to rehabilitate law out of its crisis or to restore conditions and systems back to a state prior to a crisis. This is because, as Dean Spade says in this interview, â€˜they are not broken systems needing to be fixed. They are working exactly as they were designed to work, constantly sharpening violence against targeted populations and enriching a very few people.â€™ Spadeâ€”Wismer Professor of Gender and Diversity at the Seattle University School of Law and a founder of the Sylvia Rivera Law Projectâ€”is a key scholar-activist voice on mutual aid in North America and Europe. He is author, most recently, of Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During this Crisis (And the Next). In this conversation with Oishik Sircar, Spade discusses his theoretical and political influences, how he relates the idea of crisis to critique, his sobering assessment of the limitations not only of lawÂ reform but of the role of legal education in radical transformation, his own understandings of mutual aid, his favourite words, why and how he does not see himself only as a legal scholar-activist, and his vision of hope and hopelessness in times of acute and intense crises.","Sircar, Oishik","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€˜Mutual+aid+is+present+in+every+crisisâ€™:+An+Interview+with+Dean+Spade","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Jindal Global Law Review; 13(1):191-220, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36839,""

In addition, ethnic minority populations in the United Kingdom are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. It is imperative that HCWs are appropriately supported and protected from mental harm during the pandemic. Our research aims to add to the evidence base by providing greater insight into the lived experience of HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds during the pandemic that had an impact on their mental health. Methods: We undertook a qualitative work package as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes among Healthcare workers (UK-REACH). As part of the qualitative research, we carried out 16 focus groups with a total of 61 HCWs between December 2020 and July 2021. The aim of the study was to explore topics such as their experiences, fears and concerns, while working during the pandemic. The purposive sample included ancillary healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from diverse ethnic backgrounds to ensure inclusion of underrepresented and disproportionately impacted individuals. We conducted discussions using Microsoft Teams. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed. Results: Several factors were identified which impacted on the mental health of HCWs during this period including anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy);fear (of infection);trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death);guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones);and stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload). Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected the mental health of HCWs. We identified a number of factors which may be contributing to a deterioration in mental health for participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Healthcare organisations should consider developing strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors, including recommendations made by HCWs themselves. HIGHLIGHTS HCWs and ethnic minorities are experiencing deterioration in their mental health due to COVID-19. Little is known about the lived experience of HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds and their mental health during the pandemic.

"Identity Matters: Validation of the Professional Identification Scale in a Sample of Teachers in South Africa During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Professional identity has been linked to organizational outcomes such as job performance and commitment, as well as health and well-being indices such as burnout and depression. Professional identity is a powerful mechanism that can be affected by social and environmental factors. It is therefore important to establish a reliable and valid measurement of professional identity that is useful in different contexts. The current study examines the psychometric properties of Brownâ€™s Professional Identification Scale (PIS) using three different but complementary approaches: classical test theory, Mokken analysis, and Rasch analysis. The study participants (N = 355), school teachers recruited from all over South Africa, completed the PIS, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Teacher Satisfaction Scale. The reliability and validity of a reduced 8-item version of the PIS was confirmed. Mokken and Rasch analyses indicated that the scale consists of more than one dimension, and classical test theory (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis) supported a two-factor structure. Ancillary bifactor indices indicated that professional pride and professional discontent explained a sufficient amount of the variance over and above that explained by the professional identity as a total scale. Overall, the findings support an 8-item PIS for use in a South African teacher population.","Pretorius, Tyrone B.; Padmanabhanunni, Anita, Isaacs, Serena Ann","https://www.google.com/search?q=Identity+Matters:+Validation+of+the+Professional+Identification+Scale+in+a+Sample+of+Teachers+in+South+Africa+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Trends in Psychology;: 1-19, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36842,""
"Telehealth Assessment in Rehabilitation Counseling During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Research has shown that using telehealth for rehabilitation assessment can be an effective approach. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns led to many rehabilitation counselors pivoting to telehealth assessment with their clients. This study explores rehabilitation counselorsâ€™ use of rehabilitation assessments and telehealth since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a mixed-methods approach, data from 41 rehabilitation counselors across Australia were analyzed. Participants were asked which measures they used prior to the pandemic, how their use of the measures changed during telehealth, and how their work changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and the Occupational Search Inventory were the most commonly used tests. Theoretical analysis demonstrated that participants utilized tests based on their usefulness in comprehensive assessment and rehabilitation planning, for engaging the client in the assessment process, out of necessity (mandated tests), and due to attributes of the test the counselor valued. Participants described the impact of COVID-19 on assessment practice demonstrating that despite challenges to telehealth, there were also benefits and that assessment measures could be altered for use in telehealth. Although telehealth had an impact on how rehabilitation counselors provided assessments, many found ways to make it work at a distance.","Pebdani, Roxanna N.; Zeidan, Adriana M.; Fearn-Smith, Erin M.; Matthews, Lynda R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Telehealth+Assessment+in+Rehabilitation+Counseling+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Rehabilitation counseling bulletin;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36843,""
"Navigating the digital divide: providing services to people with serious mental illness in a community setting during COVID-19","Community mental healthcare around the world has been strained as people need more help and experience more barriers to access due to COVID-19. The rapid shift to telehealth services necessitated by the pandemic has made these difficulties even more pronounced. While this transition presented challenges for nearly every healthcare system, it has proven especially difficult for low resource settings such as community health centers. This article is a critical observational study of the care transformation of a state-funded safety net psychiatric system responding to the clinical needs of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. By discussing the challenges, opportunities, and creative solutions for staff and patients, the article highlights the new importance of technology and adaptability in clinical care and outlines clear recommendations to ensure vulnerable populations do not fall into the â€œdigital divide.â€","Noori, Sofia, Jordan, Ayana, Bromage, William, Fineberg, Sarah, Cahill, John, Mathis, Walter S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Navigating+the+digital+divide:+providing+services+to+people+with+serious+mental+illness+in+a+community+setting+during+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: SN social sciences; 2(8), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36844,""
"The role of hope in language teacher's changing stress, coping, and well-being<U+2606>","Language teaching has been described as a â€œprofession in crisisâ€;a situation likely worsened by the effects of an emergency conversion to online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examines two waves of data (from April and November 2020) on stress, coping, and well-being during those eight months. Results show increase in teachers' stress associated with health and travel but decreases in stress due to online teaching and the shortage of goods in retail stores. There was a significant reduction in coping behavior as teachers settled into the new normal. Well-being, as measured by PERMA, declines significantly, and there was a significant increase in sadness, loneliness, and anger. However, teachers reported an increasing sense of growth during trauma. Time 2 data included a measure of hope, defined by feelings of agency and available pathways to goal achievement. Rarely has hope been studied among teachers in general or language teachers in particular. Results show significant, positive correlations between hope and various measures of successful coping and teacher well-being, including a sense of growth over time.

"Empirically Derived Psychological Profiles of College Students: Differential Associations With COVID-19 Impact and Social Adjustment","Using latent profile analysis, we derived psychological profiles of undergraduates during the pandemic and investigated profilesâ€™ differential associations with COVID-19 impact and social adjustment. Participants (N = 517) completed measures of depression, loneliness, and anxiety, and two indices of social adjustment: friendship support and social connectedness. We identified Severe, Moderate, and Mild symptom profiles. Higher COVID-19 impact was associated with increased odds of belonging to the Severe versus Moderate and Mild profiles, and the Moderate versus Mild profile. On social adjustment, the Mild profile outscored the Moderate profile, which outscored the Severe profile. Overall, findings imply that individuals who perceive high levels of COVID-19 impact are especially likely to belong to a profile characterized by severe psychological symptoms and that membership in this profile is associated with social maladjustment.","Kochel, Karen P.; Bagwell, Catherine L.; Abrash, Ross W.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Empirically+Derived+Psychological+Profiles+of+College+Students:+Differential+Associations+With+COVID-19+Impact+and+Social+Adjustment","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Emerging adulthood (Print);2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36847,""
"Dynamic Capabilities and Social Media Education","Equipping students with a dynamic capabilities mindset is critical, especially in social media education. Although students have access to industry-level tools and training (e.g., Hootsuite, Hubspot, Google), some scholars have suggested that educators and industry professionals alike see the gap between what is being taught and what is actually happening at the jobsite. Supporting previous studies on social media, this study suggests that applying a dynamic capability mindset, one that actively engages in sensing, seizing and transforming activities to gain competitive advantage, toward social media education will help educators be on the cutting edge of the latest industry trends, tools and issues. This study also found that the working out of the dynamic capabilities mindset would include intentional partnering with industry organizations and professionals, providing students with mock scenarios and the replication of real-life-industry pressures. These kinds of experiences will also equip students with a dynamic capabilities framework to help them continually be equipped with the knowledge, skills and abilities they need to be competitive in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) marketplace.","Kim, KiYong","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dynamic+Capabilities+and+Social+Media+Education","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Teaching Journalism & Mass Communication; 12(1):48-59, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36848,""

Design This cross-sectional study involved distributing an online survey through medical organisations, social media platforms and collaborators. Setting It included all staff based in an operating theatre environment around the world. Participants 1590 complete responses were received from 54 countries between 15 July and 15 December 2020. The average age of participants was 30â€“40 years old, 64.9% were men and 32.5% of a white ethnic background. 79.5% were surgeons with the remainder being nurses, assistants, anaesthetists, operating department practitioners or classified other. Main outcome measures Participants that had experienced any physical illness, changes in mental health, salary or time with family since the start of the pandemic as well as support available based on published recommendations. Results 32.0% reported becoming physically ill. This was more likely in those with reduced access to personal protective equipment (OR 4.62;CI 2.82 to 7.56;p&lt;0.001) and regular breaks (OR 1.56;CI 1.18 to 2.06;p=0.002).

"Connection and Resilience: Using Interviews to Support Hospitalist Well-Being During COVID-19","Like all healthcare professionals, hospitalists are at risk for burnout, and COVID-19 has made burnout symptoms worse, according to survey data of hospitalists at Mayo Clinic sites.1 Burnout is destructive;it is associated with shorter lifespan, depression, staff turnover, medical errors, and high costs to healthcare systems.2-6 Hospitalists, as leaders of healthcare teams in the hospital setting, also face personal risk in caring for hospitalized patients during the pandemic. At one New York City health system, hospital leaders fostered the emotional well-being of staff with individual and group counseling sessions, respite rooms, wellness rounds, assistance with transportation, childcare, and temporary lodging.7 A culture committee at Stanford University created several initiatives to address the needs of healthcare workers, including obtaining donations of masks and gift cards, providing snacks, and creating safe social interactions through podcasts and virtual gatherings.8 Others have offered workshops on mind-body practices.9 We report on a simple, low-cost effort led by wellness physician champions to directly support the well-being of frontline hospitalists at a large academic medical center: the personal interview. With the backing of the larger Health System Wellness Committee, which had identified wellness champion leaders early in the pandemic, we embarked on a variety of hospital medicine wellness activities. Hospitalists are accustomed to talking on the phone;they respond to pages by contacting patient care nurses and other staff by phone;they discuss patient care with consultants via phone;they update patients' families by phone;and, importantly, they sign out to oncoming teammates by phone. Because of the severe restrictions placed on social interactions, these essential exchanges with hospitalist teammates were now, at times, taking place between teammates who had never met.","Ivey, Noel M.

"Getting Serious About People Over Profit: Addressing Burnout by Establishing Meaning and Connection","Interventions to promote healthy sleep may reduce physician burnout susceptibility.5 An extensive study of physicians reported sleep-related impairment in 40% of attending physicians and 51% of house staff physicians.6 There was large correlation between sleeprelated impairment and interpersonal disengagement, work exhaustion, and overall burnout.6 After adjustment for other variables, high sleep impairment levels increased the odds of self-reporting a clinically significant medical error by 96%.6 Besides medical errors, sleep-related impairment and occupational distress have also been associated with unsolicited patient complaints. Activities that enhance social supports (e.g., peer support programs and Balint groups) and add meaning to work (e.g., professional development time, mentorship, time to develop connections with patients, etc.) are likely to provide some benefit, as they support physicians' capacity to maintain perspective, sense of purpose, and enhance sense of control over their situation.9,10 One study showed such a group normalized struggles, reduced isolation, and provided new strategies for navigating challenging interactions.11 In another study, self-facilitated physician small-group meetings improved burnout, symptoms of depression, and job satisfaction.12 Although rates of burnout among physicians have grown, physicians are resilient when compared to other occupational groups. A recent review found the rate of burnout among nurses working in hospitals ranged widely from 5% to 50%, based on specialty differences and geographical regions.14 More specifically, the review indicated the overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1%, of depersonalization 12.6%, and of lack of personal accomplishment 15.2%.15 This same review took COVID-19 into account and noted nurse burnout risk factors as younger age, decreased social support, low family and colleague readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of COVID-19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high-risk environment, working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, increased workload, and lower level of specialized training regarding COVID-19.15 Burnout has many consequences in nurses. Emotional exhaustion is negatively associated with the quality and safety of care, patient satisfaction, nurses' organizational commitment, and productivity.14 Nurse burnout has been a significant factor in predicting medication-associated errors.16 Protective factors in nurses include belief in readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreaks, willingness to participate in frontline work, prior training and experience in COVID-19 patients' management, safe practices, and increased social support.15 Empathy and nursing organizational climate have been found to be protective against burnout, suggesting this could be targeted in managerial interventions.17 Nursing surveys of three types of work engagement (i.e., vigor, dedication, and absorption) and resiliency suggested some protection from burnout.18 Mindfulness-based interventions could potentially have a protective effect for burnout in nurses.19 (See Table 2 for an overview of how burnout impacts feelings about careers in nurses and physicians.)

"SARS-CoV-2 infection and heart disease in dogs and cats","Since the appearance of COVID-19 in humans, there have been numerous reports of dogs and cats being infected with SARSCoV- 2, with cats appearing to be particularly susceptible. The portal of entry of the virus into the body's cells is a membrane receptor called ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) belonging to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The ACE2 receptor is expressed in airway epithelial cells, myocardium, venous and arterial endothelial cells, kidney, liver, oral cavity, intestine and also adipose tissue, explaining the diversity of clinical expression of the disease, with respiratory manifestations predominating. SARS-CoV-2 causes an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system. In addition, the virus has a direct action combined with an immune reaction, that is sometimes intense, causing a cascade of lesions, mainly in the lungs but also in the heart. The clinical expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains rare in dogs and cats and mainly includes fever, depression, anorexia, digestive, respiratory or ocular disorders. As in humans, various cardiovascular clinical signs are less frequently seen. Several cases of myocarditis, correlated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (PCR or serology), have been identified in England and at least one in France. In the latter case, further investigation led to a strong suspicion of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy complicated by myocarditis. It is highly likely that obesity (with significant fat deposition in the pleural and pericardial spaces, tissues with high expression of the ACE2 receptor) may have favoured these complications. SARS-CoV-2 infection should therefore now be included in the differential diagnosis of agents causing myocarditis and pneumonia in both cats and dogs.","Chetboul, V.","https://www.google.com/search?q=SARS-CoV-2+infection+and+heart+disease+in+dogs+and+cats","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Summa, Animali da Compagnia; 39(6):19-25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36853,""
"Disability, Discrimination, and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Stress Process Model","Drawing on data from a community survey with a sizeable subsample of people with physical, intellectual, and psychological disabilities in the Intermountain West region of the United States (N = 2,043), this investigation examined the association of social stressors stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic with ableism or disability-related discrimination. We further assessed the significance of these associations for variation by disability status in psychological well-being with a moderated mediation analysis. Study findings provide clear evidence that greater pandemic-related stressor exposure was associated with greater discrimination, which in turn increased the psychologically distressing aspects of the pandemic for people with disabilities relative to people without disabilities. This set of findings challenges us to think about how we engage in research concerning ableism and the proliferation of macro-level stressors such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also support the application of a minority stress model in addressing mental health contingencies among people with disabilitiesâ€”in this case, in examining the pandemicâ€™s psychological impact.","Brown, Robyn Lewis, Ciciurkaite, Gabriele","https://www.google.com/search?q=Disability,+Discrimination,+and+Mental+Health+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+A+Stress+Process+Model","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Society and mental health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36854,""

Limited qualitative data so far has offered in-depth details concerning what underlies these challenges, but none provide comprehensive comparison across different healthcare systems. Objective: To explore qualitative findings relating to healthcare worker distress from two different countries to understand the nuanced similarities and differences with respect to the sources and impact of distress relating to COVID-19. Method: A comparative interpretive thematic analysis was carried out between two qualitative data sets examining healthcare workersâ€™ experiences of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from Canada and the UK were collected in parallel and analyzed in an iterative, collaborative process. Results: A number of sources of distress cut across both study settings including concerns about safety and patient care, challenges at home or in oneâ€™s personal life, communication issues, work environment, media and public perception, and government responses to the pandemic. These sit on a spectrum from individual to institutional sources and were mutually reinforcing. Our analysis also suggested that common mechanisms such as exacerbations in uncertainty, hypervigilance, and moral injury underpinned these sources, which contributed to how they were experienced as distressing. Conclusion: This is the first international collaboration utilising qualitative data to examine this pressing issue. Despite differences in the political, social, health service, and pandemic-related context, the sources and mechanisms of distress experienced by healthcare workers in Canada and the UK were remarkably similar.

"Experiences in remote learning: Perceptions of West Virginia educators during the COVID-19 pandemic","In March 2020, the threat of illness caused by Covid-19 prompted West Virginia Governor Jim Justice to abruptly close public schools statewide. Instruction was delivered remotely for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year and sporadically across the state during the 2020-2021 school year with educators holding class meetings and delivering instruction where technology and a reliable internet connection were available. Gaining understanding as it relates to teacher's remote learning experience may provide insight into how administrators can prepare for future interruptions in in-person instruction. Identifying specific areas teachers felt were challenging or stressful may provide a point in which to focus attention when creating an action plan. The purpose of this descriptive, nonexperimental study was to examine the perception of West Virginia's public educators as they relate to their remote learning experience. Using a web-based survey, data reflected student interaction decreased and instructional methods changed dramatically throughout the remote learning period. Data also found teachers relied on specific software to deliver instruction and gained technological competence as a result of their experience. Educators felt confident in their ability to teach remotely but lacked confidence reaching unmotivated students or encouraging students to attend class. Data reflects educators' intention to remain in public education despite the stress of the remote learning period. Specific stressors of the remote learning experience include concern for students' and teacher's mental health and student physical well-being. Numerous statistically significant differences were found among four demographic variables, sex, experience level, instructional level taught, and prior technology training. Lastly, major professional challenges are identified including fear of the unknown and internet and technology concerns.

"COVID-19 vaccine uptake among physicians during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic: Attitude, intentions, and determinants: A cross-sectional study","Background Developed within a short period of time, the COVID-19 vaccine is not yet widely accepted among the public despite its availability, including by physicians, who are considered a vulnerable group. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional study selected 436 governmental physicians from different specializations, representing four random administrative regions in Egypt. The data were collected through a self-administrated online questionnaire and analyzed using suitable tests. Results Out of the studied 436 physicians, 229 (52.2%) [aged 20â€“30, 284 (65.1%)] were women, 270 (61.9%) were residents, 219 (50.2%) were married, 398 (91.3%) were non-smokers, and 263 (60.3%) were non-frontline caregivers. The majority of the physicians, 227 (52.1%) of them, hesitated to take the vaccine, 236 (54.1%) had not decided on the preferred type of vaccine, and 101 (23.2%) were neutrally confident in the Egyptian healthcare system;302 (96.3%) had no history of drug or food hypersensitivity. There was no statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) relationship between the physicians' attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine uptake and the studied demographic variables. There was a statistically significant connection between all of the doctors' intentions to get the COVID-19 vaccine and all of the four attitude domains that were looked at. Conclusion The study concluded that a low level of willingness among Egyptian physicians to take the COVID-19 vaccine is a prevalent problem. COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and non-acceptance were linked to negative attitudes about natural immunity, mistrust of vaccine benefits, and concerns about commercial profiteering.","Amer, Samar A.; Shah, Jaffer, Abd-Ellatif, Eman Elsayed, El Maghawry, Hala A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+vaccine+uptake+among+physicians+during+the+second+wave+of+COVID-19+pandemic:+Attitude,+intentions,+and+determinants:+A+cross-sectional+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in public health; 10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36859,""
"COVID-somnia: anxiety, insomnia, and poor sleep among second-line healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic","Background Little information is available about the linkage between sleep affection and COVID-19. Preliminary reports and clinical observations focused on the appearance of related mental health issues, especially in healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods A cross-sectional study is conducted on the COVID-19Â second-line HCWs using an English online survey prepared via Google forms. The survey focused on sociodemographic and profession-related characteristics (age, sex, smoking, history of previous sleep disorders or medications affecting sleep, comorbidities specialty, years of experience, and number of hours worked per week) and COVID-19-associated risks (being on the second line of COVID-19 management, following updates and news about COVID-19, and getting an infection with COVID-19 or having a colleague/friend who was infected with or died of COVID-19). Assessment of anxiety, insomnia, and sleep quality was done using the relevant diagnostic scales. Results This study included 162Â second-line HCWs with a mean age of 34.36 Â± 8.49Â years. Although being in second lines, there was a high prevalence of anxiety (49.38%), insomnia (56.17%), and poor sleep quality (67.9%) during the pandemic. One condition was recently developed after the pandemic: insomnia in 6.6%, anxiety in 5.7%, and poor sleep in 16%. Two conditions were developed: insomnia and poor sleep in 21.7%, anxiety and poor sleep in 7.5%, and insomnia and anxiety in 10.4%. The three conditions were de novo experienced in 19.8%. A total of 22.4% of those who followed daily COVID-19 updates developed de novo combined anxiety, insomnia, and poor sleep. A total of 38.5% of participants that had been infected with COVID-19 developed de novo combined anxiety, insomnia, and poor sleep. A total of 50% of participants who had a colleague/friend who died with COVID-19 developed de novo combined anxiety, insomnia, and poor sleep.

"An analysis of business studentsâ€™ stressors and their coping strategies in the post-pandemic era","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a dramatic change in teachingâ€“learning practices in higher education across the world. The post-pandemic era with a new shift of teachingâ€“learning phase raises the concern of students' psychological well-being, especially the novice, i.e., first-year undergraduate students, as first-year students often struggle to adjust to the new environment of higher institutions, thereby depressive symptoms are more prevalent among them. In this regard, a qualitative study was conducted followed by a dyadic approach to explore the symptoms of studentsâ€™ psychological stressors, their causes, and provide essential remedies for coping with such behaviors in the post-pandemic era. The findings show that studentsâ€™ stressors were commonly reported due to the academic workload, institutional regulations, lack of resources, and financial constraints. Regarding indications, unusual behavior, lack of confidence, improper sleep, and lack of motivation were identified as the primary symptoms of studentsâ€™ stress. However, participants reported a lack of understanding regarding stress-related matters. Yet, students and faculty members try to adopt several strategies for reducing such stressors. By examining the perceived psychological stress, indications, and coping behaviors, this study enriches the literature by bridging pragmatic and theoretical gaps regarding studentsâ€™ stressors of business management. Furthermore, the study mainly suggests that adequate institutional support should be provided to deal with studentsâ€™ problems that cause stress. Also, universities should organize workshops or seminars to cultivate psychological health awareness among students and faculty members.","Akram, Huma, Bhutto, Maqsood H.; Chughtai, Muhammad Salman","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+analysis+of+business+studentsâ€™+stressors+and+their+coping+strategies+in+the+post-pandemic+era","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: DECISION;: 1-14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36861,""

"Factors associated with depressive symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico: A 2021 national survey","Previous studies have identified a set of variables associated with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the existing antecedents in Mexico, in addition to being limited to the beginning of the health emergency, made use of small and unrepresentative samples. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify the prevalence and factors associated with clinically significant depressive symptomatology (CSDS) in a representative Mexican sample of 2021. A secondary cross-sectional analysis of the Encuesta Nacional de Bienestar Autorreportado (ENBIARE) was conducted. For the present study, the effective sample was 30,901. Univariate and bivariate anaylses were followed by a multiple Poisson regression, which served to obtain adjusted prevalence ratios of each variable under study. The prevalence of CSDS in the year 2021 was 15.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%. In the multivariable analysis, the factors associated with CSDS were the number of recent stressful events, having a major functional limitation, not having social support from family or friends, being female, having suffered recent discrimination, alcohol or other drug use (by oneself or someone at home), not being married or cohabiting, living in a rural area, having had a diagnosis of COVID-19, having lost a job, living with a chronic patient, not doing physical exercise, and having a low educational level. The main limitations were the cross-sectional nature of the data, the use of self-report measures, as well as the fact that this was a secondary analysis that did not allow consideration of additional variables. A set of personal and contextual variables were identified that can help focus prevention and intervention efforts on the phenomenon of depression.","Valencia, Torres-Quispe, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Cayo, Reyes-Aguilar, Acevedo-Cahuana","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.088","20220830","COVID-19; Cross-sectional studies; Depression; Health surveys; Mexico","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36863,""
"The impact of Covid-19 on people under opioid substitution treatment","Given the aggravation on the general population's quality of life due to covid-19 and the vulnerability of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD) to acute stress, the aim of the current study was to better comprehend the impact of covid-19 on quality of life and mental health of PWUD as well as their drug use patterns. Another study had been conducted prior to the covid-19 outbreak, which assessed quality of life, indicative PTSD symptoms, and drug use patterns of people who were attending an Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST), in Athens, Greece. As a continuation of the aforementioned study, the same variables were assessed in May and June 2020, after the first lockdown measures. 104 patients agreed to participate. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Scale (PCL-C) were used as well as toxicology tests. The only statistically significant outcome was a reduction regarding the dimension referring to the relationship between the individual and their environment. People with low quality of life were found to experience more severe Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms after lockdown comparing to those with high quality of life. There was also a statistically non-significant increase in PTSD scores before and after lockdown measures. Regarding drug use patterns, the present research reveals an overall decline in drug use during quarantine. There was a statistically significant decrease in opioid (22.3%) and in benzodiazepine (35%) use after lockdown. Also, a statistically significant increase in mean scores of indicative PTSD symptoms of people who decreased opioid use during and after lockdown measures was found. In regards to amphetamine use, research findings underline a non-significant increase in use (8.7%). The pandemic's impact on the life of people on opioid substitution treatment should be taken into consideration and further studies need to be conducted in order to protect this populations' quality of life and maximize the potential benefits such as reduced access to illicit substances.","Tzeferakos, Koutelou, Tritari, Skourteli, Kouimtsidis, Kokkolis, Stylianidis","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.092","20220830","Covid-19; Opioid Substitution Treatment; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; Quality of Life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36864,""
"Elder financial abuse and the COVID-19 pandemic: A call to action through training programmes?","Within the last decade, there has been a growing debate regarding financial capacity and abuse as one of the most important challenges that older adults are facing in their everyday lives.1 Currently older adults are highly impacted by pre-and post-COVID-19 measures and there is a massive increase in financial exploitation reports involving older adults worldwide,2 an increase that can be attributed to a number of reasons, such as the higher rates of depression among socially isolated seniors (a diagnosis itself linked to abuse, as it can worsen elders' cognitive and physical condition by making them dependent and vulnerable), but also due to of mass redundancies, financial pressure and stress faced by younger family members (childrenandgrandchildren).3 Althoughpriorresearchemphasizedmainlyindividualcognitive aspects (e.g. financial knowledge/self-beliefs/behaviors in the financial decision-making process), the interaction with emotional and socio-cultural factors are not thoroughly examined. Unfortunately, there are scarce organized large-scale research attempts at national and none at international level to focus on financial abuse of elders suffering from different types of neurocognitive disorders as well as healthy elders, not only before the COVID-19 era, but especially during and after COVID-19 health and social crisis.4 In addition to the lack of research neglecting the cross-cultural perspective, there is also a dire need to refocus previous research attempts that mainly examine perceptions of financial abuse with experimental manipulations, not in real world situations and only from the viewpoint of the patient/family, while disregarding the attitudes and education /educational needs of healthcare experts.5 Future research questions that deserve to be examined, but still remain unanswered, are: What are the cognitive-emotional characteristics of elders prone to abuse and of the persons in their social environment? How do medical-psychiatric conditions influence elders financial abuse? What and how do individuals and groups from different social and cultural settings define-perceive financial abuse and the characteristics of the 'offender' and 'victim'? Under what real-life conditions we-as-'guardians' detect and are willing to report elder financial abuse and how can we 'protect' elders? What do we expect from the state, legal systems and the important others to do? What do elders themselves think and feel about financial abuse and how do they react? What is the 'correct reaction/directives'? What are healthcare professionals' attitudes and knowledge on this topic? Could all the above-mentioned points be taught in programmes? All the above will not only give an alternative viewpoint on this hot, complex multifaceted ethical, legal and practical issue (that many of us are concerned with, but at the same time are unwilling to systematically explore), but may assist us in understanding, planning and acting 'appropriately'. For that to happen, different questions should be addressed and a combination of methods is needed (mixed quantitative and qualitative designs in cross-cultural settings). A final point that may help to elucidate this confusing problem is the introduction of new statistical approaches such as multilevel analyses, which allow simultaneous examination of group-level (society) and individual-level (elder) factors and thus reveal to us the broader context. Financial education programmes for the prevention of financial exploitation use a wide and appropriate range of delivery methods and dissemination channels focusing on the deficits, strengths as well as needs of the target groups (older adults, family members/caregivers, healthcare professionals). Due to the complex social situation, it is imperative to educate older adults as well as their caregivers to make sound financial decisions with the resources available. Such programmes have already success, because they provide not only access to financial advisors available for advice and questions on financial issues, they provide resources which are user-friendly (based on the reading level of the older individuals and caregivers), but include enough detail to be useful in planning.6 In the cases of individuals without computer access or without computer literacy, alternative options are offered, such as services accessible over the phone or in person, brochures, handouts, or other written materials, or individual sessions and classes.6 The aim of promotion of financial education on a regular basis, (both via interactive online and with the use of offline resources), includes information fostering knowledge of money management and scam prevention, not only on an individual, but at the community level.7 Revisiting existing research and asking for an update on emerging issues and unexplored realms is a researchers' obligation. So, are existing educational programmes adequate? A contemporary empirical re-assessment will tell us and old and new questions will make us ponder where to go next.","Giannouli, Tsolaki","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.090","20220830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36865,""
"Effects of Unemployment on Opioid Use Treatment Trajectories: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Living with an opioid use disorder (OUD) can make finding and sustaining employment a significant challenge and is only expected to get worse in the COVID-19 environment. For most individuals in OUD treatment, being employed is an important part of their recovery journey. Employment has several benefits, including reductions in preoccupation with symptoms, social isolation, risk of suicide, hopelessness, and economic instability, which if not addressed often result in homelessness. Therefore, employment is an important social determinant of health, especially among those with OUD. Employment success and OUD, however, may vary based on race, age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Return to work support as states begin to reopen will be critically important to improve treatment outcomes for individuals with OUD in a post-COVID-19 environment, requiring utilizations of evidence-based interventions. Nurses, particularly psychiatric mental health and addiction nurses, should routinely screen for employment needs of their patients with OUD and connect them to the necessary support services. Finally, nurses should advocate for regulatory reform that allows for employment support services to be billable and integrated in psychiatric and behavioral health services just like other mental health services.","Mumba, Davis, Smith, Evans, Castillo","https://doi.org/10.1097/JAN.0000000000000480","20220830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36866,""
"Smartphone overuse, depression &amp; anxiety in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Medical students have made particular use of smartphones during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although higher smartphone overuse has been observed, its effect on mental disorders is unclear. This study aimed to assess the association between smartphone overuse and mental disorders in Peruvian medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 370 students aged between 16 and 41 years (median age: 20) in three universities from July to October 2020. A survey including Smartphone Dependence and Addiction Scale, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 was applied. Prevalence ratios were estimated using generalized linear models. Smartphone overuse was a common feature among students (n = 291, 79%). Depressive symptoms were present in 290 (78%) students and anxiety symptoms in 255 (69%). Adjusted for confounders, addictive/dependent smartphone use was significantly associated with presence of depressive symptoms (PR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.20-1.38 for dependent use; PR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.12-1.50 for addictive use). Also, addictive/dependent smartphone use was significantly associated with presence of anxiety symptoms (PR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.14-2.23 for dependent use; PR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.07-2.41 for addictive use). Our findings suggest that medical students exposed to smartphone overuse are vulnerable to mental disorders. Overuse may reflect an inappropriate way of finding emotional relief, which may significantly affect quality of life and academic performance. Findings would assist faculties to establish effective measures for prevention of smartphone overuse.","Santander-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Peralta, Guevara-Morales, DÃƒÂ­az-VÃƒÂ©lez, Valladares-Garrido","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273575","20220830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36867,""
"Temporal trends in calls for suicide attempts to poison control centers in France during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide study","Concerns have been raised about early vs. later impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal behavior. However, data remain sparse to date. We investigated all calls for intentional drug or other toxic ingestions to the eight Poison Control Centers in France between 1st January 2018 and 31st May 2022. Data were extracted from the French National Database of Poisonings. Calls during the study period were analyzed using time trends and time series analyses with SARIMA models (based on the first two years). Breakpoints were determined using Chow test. These analyses were performed together with examination of age groups (Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°11, 12-24, 25-64,Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°65Ã‚Â years) and gender effects when possible. Over the studied period, 66,589 calls for suicide attempts were received. Overall, there was a downward trend from 2018, which slowed down in October 2019 and was followed by an increase from November 2020. Number of calls observed during the COVID period were above what was expected. However, important differences were found according to age and gender. The increase in calls from mid-2020 was particularly observed in young females, while middle-aged adults showed a persisting decrease. An increase in older-aged people was observed from mid-2019 and persisted during the pandemic. The pandemic may therefore have exacerbated a pre-existing fragile situation in adolescents and old-aged people. This study emphasizes the rapidly evolving situation regarding suicidal behaviour during the pandemic, the possibility of age and gender differences in impact, and the value of having access to real-time information to monitor suicidal acts.","Jollant, Blanc-Brisset, Cellier, Ambar Akkaoui, Tran, Hamel, Piot, Nourredine, Nisse, Hawton, Descatha, Vodovar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-022-00907-z","20220830","Adolescent; Age; Attempted suicide; COVID-19; Gender; Poison Control Center; Surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36868,""
"Family Strengthening in the Context of COVID-19: Adapting a Community-Based Intervention from Kenya to the United States","COVID-19 led to widespread disruption of services that promote family well-being. Families impacted most were those already experiencing disparities due to structural and systemic barriers. Existing support systems faded into the background as families became more isolated. New approaches were needed to deliver evidence-based, low-cost interventions to reach families within communities. We adapted a family strengthening intervention developed in Kenya (""Tuko Pamoja"") for the United States. We tested a three-phase participatory adaptation process. In phase 1, we conducted community focus groups including 11 organizations to identify needs and a community partner. In phase 2, the academic-community partner team collaboratively adapted the intervention. We held a development workshop and trained community health workers to deliver the program using an accelerated process combining training, feedback, and iterative revisions. In phase 3, we piloted Coping Together with 18 families, collecting feedback through session-specific surveys and participant focus groups. Community focus groups confirmed thatÃ‚Â concepts from Tuko Pamoja were relevant, and adaptation resulted in a contextualized intervention-""Coping Together""-an 8-session virtual program for multiple families. As in Tuko Pamoja, communication skills are central and applied for developing family values, visions, and goals. Problem-solving and coping skills then equip families to reach goals, while positive emotion-focused activities promote openness to change. Sessions are interactive, emphasizing skills practice. Participants reported high acceptability and appropriateness, and focus groups suggested that most content was understood and applied in ways consistent with the theory of change. The accelerated reciprocal adaptation process and intervention could apply across resource-constrained settings.","Puffer, Johnson, Quick, Rieder, Mansoor, Proeschold-Bell, Jones, Moore-Lawrence, Rasmussen, Cucuzzella, Burwell, Dowdy, Moore, Rosales, Sanyal, Ramachandran, Duerr, Tice, Ayuku, Boone","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-022-01418-9","20220830","Cultural adaptation; Family intervention; Global mental health; Reciprocal adaptation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36869,""
"Multicentre, England-wide randomised controlled trial of the 'Foundations' smartphone application in improving mental health and well-being in a healthcare worker population","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have faced considerable pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. For some, this has resulted in mental health distress and disorder. Although interventions have sought to support HCWs, few have been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the 'Foundations' application (app) on general (non-psychotic) psychiatric morbidity. We conducted a multicentre randomised controlled trial of HCWs at 16 NHS trusts (trial registration number: EudraCT: 2021-001279-18). Participants were randomly assigned to the app or wait-list control group. Measures were assessed at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks. The primary outcome was general psychiatric morbidity (using the General Health Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included: well-being; presenteeism; anxiety; depression and insomnia. The primary analysis used mixed-effects multivariable regression, presented as adjusted mean differences (aMD). Between 22 March and 3 June 2021, 1002 participants were randomised (500:502), and 894 (89.2%) followed-up. The sample was predominately women (754/894, 84.3%), with a mean age of 44Ã¢â€¹â€¦3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 34-53). Participants randomised to the app had a reduction in psychiatric morbidity symptoms (aMD = -1.39, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.74), improvement in well-being (aMD = 0Ã¢â€¹â€¦54, 95% CI 0Ã¢â€¹â€¦20 to 0Ã¢â€¹â€¦89) and reduction in insomnia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0Ã¢â€¹â€¦36, 95% CI 0Ã¢â€¹â€¦21 to 0Ã¢â€¹â€¦60). No other significant findings were found, or adverse events reported. The app had an effect in reducing psychiatric morbidity symptoms in a sample of HCWs. Given it is scalable with no adverse effects, the app may be used as part of an organisation's tiered staff support package. Further evidence is needed on long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.","Gnanapragasam, Tinch-Taylor, Scott, Hegarty, Souliou, Bhundia, Lamb, Weston, Greenberg, Madan, Stevelink, Raine, Carter, Wessely","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.103","20220830","Randomised controlled trial; epidemiology; information technologies; outcome studies; psychosocial interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36870,""

In this study, using various culture-independent techniques, including high-throughput sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), the ATP bioluminescence system, and electron microscopy, we investigated the structure, assembly, quantity, and dynamic metabolic activity of the bacterial community on smartphone surfaces and the user's dominant and nondominant hands. We found that smartphone microbiotas are more similar to the nondominant hand microbiotas than the dominant hand microbiotas and show significantly decreased phylogenetic diversity and stronger deterministic processes than the hand microbiota. Significant interindividual microbiota differences were observed, contributing to an average owner identification accuracy of 70.6% using smartphone microbiota. Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 1.75Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>6</sup> bacteria (2.24Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) exist on the touchscreen of a single smartphone, and microbial activities remain stable for at least 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°h. Scanning electron microscopy detected large fragments harboring microorganisms, suggesting that smartphone microbiotas live on the secreta or other substances, e.g., human cell debris and food debris. Fortunately, simple smartphone cleaning/hygiene could significantly reduce the bacterial load. Taken together, our results demonstrate that smartphone surfaces not only are a reservoir of microbes but also provide an ecological niche in which microbiotas, particularly opportunistic pathogens, can survive, be active, and even grow. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Currently, people spend an average of 4.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°h per day on their smartphones. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this figure may still be increasing. The high frequency of smartphone usage may allow microbes, particularly pathogens, to attach to-and even survive on-phone surfaces, potentially causing adverse effects on humans. We employed various culture-independent techniques in this study to evaluate the microbiological features and hygiene of smartphones, including community assembly, bacterial load, and activity. Our data showed that deterministic processes drive smartphone microbiota assembly and that approximately 1.75Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>6</sup> bacteria exist on a single smartphone touchscreen, with activities being stable for at least 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°h. Fortunately, simple smartphone cleaning/hygiene could significantly reduce the bacterial load. This work expands our understanding of the microbial ecology of smartphone surfaces and might facilitate the development of electronic device cleaning/hygiene guidelines to support public health.","He, Shen, Zhang, Sun, Shao","https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01508-22","20220830","human health; microbial community assembly; potential pathogen; skin microbiota; smartphone hygiene; smartphone microorganism; surface microbiota","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36871,""
"[Parental experiences of distance schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Effects on children with and without mental health problems]","In some lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, schools were closed and children attended distance learning. To investigate parental experiences of the effects of distance learning on the wellbeing of child and parent(s), and whether this differed between children with and without mental health problems and their parents. Parents of children with (n = 192) and without (n = 271) mental health problems reported their experiences with distance learning. We investigated whether experiences differed between groups of parents, and whether experiences were influenced by characteristics of parents. Parents of children with mental health problems reported the quality of distance learning and the ability of their child to participate as lower relative to other parents. These differences increased when parents themselves were in higher need of support. General experiences and the levels of stress reported by parents did not differ between groups. Parents reported an increase in their child&amp;rsquo;s digital media use, particularly for children with mental health problems. Children with mental health problems seem more negatively affected by distance learning, especially when parents have problems themselves. These findings are in line with multiple recent studies and argue for minimizing distance learning.","Staff, Fuermaier, van den Hoofdakker, Luman, Thorell, Dekkers","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Parental+experiences+of+distance+schooling+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+Effects+on+children+with+and+without+mental+health+problems].","20220830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36872,""
"A Critical Popularization of Customized Curation Service for Cosmetics in Republic of Korea","Consumer and advanced consumption culture in modern society is an era that focuses on individual personality and value, and ""my own customized products,"" or customized marketing strategies, are actively being developed throughout the industry. Recently, IT technologies that can support personalized services such as artificial intelligence, ubiquitous systems, and marketing automation have been recognized for their potential, directly or indirectly affecting distribution industries affected by personal consumption culture. Accordingly, customized products or services, i.e., customization, are attracting attention as an effective methodology to cope with such market changes. Among the necessities used by modern women, cosmetics account for an endless interest in beauty and maintaining physical and mental health, and as the cosmetics market expands, it is considered that the cosmetics industry needs a clearer and in-depth study on the cosmetics sub-market to satisfy consumers' diverse needs. This review paper is a literature review, and a narrative review approach has been used for this study. A total of 300 to 400 references were selected using representative journal search websites such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, ResearchGate, LitCovid, DBPia and RISS, of which a total of 37 papers were selected in the final stage based on 2013 to 2022 using PRISMA flow diagram. Therefore, this study suggested to indicate the changes in the cosmetics market due to the emergence of cosmetics curation services after the COVID-19 pandemic, advanced changes in consumer purchase patterns following the 4th Industrial Revolution, and significant future prospects of cosmetics curation services. As the beauty and cosmetology industry is expected to develop in the future, it will grow as a centerpiece of the beauty industry and symbolizes nationalized cultural pride. Therefore, this review article will be continuing to promote customization as a premium beauty service in Republic of Korea through corporate analysis.","Park, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.15340","20220830","4th industrial revolution; COVID-19 Pandemic; Customized cosmetics; Customized cosmetics business system; Customized curation; Product consumption markets","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36873,""
"Predictors of mental health deterioration from pre- to post-COVID-19 outbreak","Mental health was only modestly affected in adults during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic on the group level, but interpersonal variation was large. We aim to investigate potential predictors of the differences in changes in mental health. Data were aggregated from three Dutch ongoing prospective cohorts with similar methodology for data collection. We included participants with pre-pandemic data gathered during 2006-2016, and who completed online questionnaires at least once during lockdown in The Netherlands between 1 April and 15 May 2020. Sociodemographic, clinical (number of mental health disorders and personality factors) and COVID-19-related variables were analysed as predictors of relative changes in four mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety and worry symptoms, and loneliness), using multivariate linear regression analyses. We included 1517 participants with (<i>n</i> = 1181) and without (<i>n</i> = 336) mental health disorders. Mean age was 56.1 years (s.d. 13.2), and 64.3% were women. Higher neuroticism predicted increases in all four mental health outcomes, especially for worry (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.172, <i>P</i> = 0.003). Living alone and female gender predicted increases in depressive symptoms and loneliness (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.05-0.08), whereas quarantine and strict adherence with COVID-19 restrictions predicted increases in anxiety and worry symptoms (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.07-0.11).Teleworking predicted a decrease in anxiety symptoms (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.07) and higher age predicted a decrease in anxiety (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.08) and worry symptoms (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.10). Our study showed neuroticism as a robust predictor of adverse changes in mental health, and identified additional sociodemographic and COVID-19-related predictors that explain longitudinal variability in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rius Ottenheim, Pan, Kok, JÃƒÂ¶rg, Eikelenboom, Horsfall, Luteijn, van Oppen, Rhebergen, Schoevers, Penninx, Giltay","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.555","20220830","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; depressive disorders; epidemiology; neuroticism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36874,""

The study was conducted from July to October 2020 at a large Midwestern academic center. Among the respondents, there were significant increases in mental health symptoms attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, including anxiety (71% of respondents), depression (66%), suicidal thoughts or behaviors (45%), and aggression (31%). There were significant differences in reported increases in symptoms by age and gender. In addition, 38% of participants reported that the pandemic led to a change or closure of their health care treatment, including mental health providers, with 22% reporting that reduced treatment access led to their emergency visit.

"[Long COVID: nosographic aspects and clinical epidemiology]","Recent evidence shows that a range of persistent or new symptoms can manifest after 4-12 weeks in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition has been coined long COVID by COVID-19 survivors among social support groups. Long COVID can affect the whole spectrum of people with COVID-19, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. Like the acute form, long COVID has multisystemic aspects. Patients can manifest with a very heterogeneous multitude of symptoms, including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression, muscle pain, brain fog, anosmia/dysgeusia, headache, and limitation of functional capacity, which impact their quality of life. Because of the extreme clinical heterogeneity, and also due to the lack of a shared, specific definition, it is very difficult to know the real prevalence and incidence of this condition. Risk factors for developing long COVID would be female sex, initial severity, and comorbidities. Globally, with the re-emergence of new waves, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating a more thorough understanding of potential sequelae of COVID-19.

This on-site cross-sectional survey was conducted in the antenatal and fetal medicine clinics in a tertiary care hospital in North India. Pregnant women attending the maternal-fetal unit filled out a 31-item questionnaire assessing their KAP towards COVID-19. Correlation between KAP was assessed by using Spearman's rank correlation. Some 302 questionnaires were analyzed: more than 90% of women had correct general knowledge of COVID, but only 12.3% scored 50% or more for pregnancy-related knowledge. Some 67% of women reported more than usual anxiety, and 7.7% reported severe anxiety levels. General knowledge improved with age, education, and occupation but pregnancy-related knowledge and anxiety score were unaffected by these variables. Pregnant women's knowledge of COVID-19 infection, in general, is excellent and they have the correct attitude towards preventive strategies.

"","Health care workers (HCW) have been identified as a risk group to suffer psychological burden derived from Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition, possible gender differences in the emotional reactions derived from COVID-19 pandemic have been suggested in this population. The aims of the study were to explore the impact of COVID-19 as well as possible gender differences on mental health status and suicidality in a cohort of HCW. One thousand four hundred and thirty-two HCW responded to an online survey including sociodemographic, clinical, and psychometric tests in May 2020 while 251 HCW answered in November 2020. Mental health status was measured by General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) in both time periods. HCW informed of a worsening in somatic symptomatology over the follow up period. Gender differences were found in all GHQ-28 dimensions as well in the total score of the questionnaire. Post-hoc analyses displayed significant interaction between the time and gender in somatic and anxiety dimensions as well as in GHQ-28 total score. Stress produced by COVID-19 spreading and the feeling of being overwhelmed at work resulted the main predictors of psychological distress although each domain is characterized by a specific set of predictors. Somatic reactions represent the most sensitive dimension over the follow-up period. Moreover, women are characterized by a greater psychological distress at the beginning, although these differences tend to disappear over time. Finally, a complex network of factors predicted different dimensions of psychological distress, showing the complexity of prevention in high-risk populations facing major disasters.","Canal-Rivero, Montes-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Garrido-Torres, Moreno-Mellado, Reguera-Pozuelo, Ruiz-Veguilla, Crespo-Facorro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2022.08.001","20220830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36878,""
"Resilience and Depressive Symptoms Mediated Pathways from Social Support to Suicidal Ideation Among Undergraduates During the COVID-19 Campus Lockdown in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected people's mental health. The direct and indirect pathways between social support and suicidal ideation in the period are still unclear. This study explores the pathways from social support to suicidal ideation through resilience and depressive symptoms among undergraduates during the COVID-19 campus lockdown. During two weeks of the COVID-19 campus lockdown, a total of 12,945 undergraduates at a university in eastern China completed the questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, suicidal ideation, social support, resilience, and depressive symptoms. A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to analyze the direct and indirect pathways from social support to suicidal ideation via the mediators of resilience and depressive symptoms. Of the 12,917 undergraduates included in this study, 7.4% (n = 955) reported they sometimes had suicidal ideation, 0.8% (n = 109) reported they often had suicidal ideation, 0.9% (n = 122) reported they always had suicidal ideation, and 13.2% (n = 1704) reported they had depressive symptoms. Social support exerted significant direct (ÃŽÂ² = -0.058), indirect (ÃŽÂ² = -0.225), and total (ÃŽÂ² = -0.283) effects on suicidal ideation; 20.5% of the total effect was direct, and 79.5% was indirect. Social support predicted suicidal ideation through resilience (ÃŽÂ² = -0.038), and depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = -0.087), explaining 13.4%, and 30.7% of the total effect, respectively. Social support predicted suicidal ideation through the sequential mediation of resilience and depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = -0.099), explaining 35.0% of the total effect. This is the first study to provide the evidence of pathways from social support to suicidal ideation through resilience and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 campus lockdown among undergraduates in China. Both direct and indirect pathways from social support to suicidal ideation were identified as intervention targets to reduce suicidal ideation.","Zhang, Liu, Mi, Wang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S377158","20220830","COVID-19; campus lockdown; depressive symptoms; resilience; social support; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36879,""
"A Call to Action: Integration of Buprenorphine Prescribing Into the Care of Persons With Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Opioid Use Disorder","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we also experienced a worsening opioid overdose epidemic. Untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with worse HIV-related outcomes. Buprenorphine is a safe, evidence-based medication for OUD and is effective in reducing opioid craving and overdose and improving outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Despite the longstanding evidence supporting the benefits of buprenorphine, there remains an implementation gap in the uptake of buprenorphine prescribing in HIV care settings. To improve integration of OUD care and HIV primary care, we recommend (1) all HIV clinicians obtain a buprenorphine waiver, (2) teaching on OUD should be integrated into infectious diseases and HIV continuing medical education, and (3) previously validated models of integrated care should be leveraged to urgently expand access to buprenorphine for persons with HIV and OUD.","Fujita, Wilson, Kennedy","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac400","20220830","HIV; buprenorphine; opioid use disorder; substance use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36880,""
"(Re)imagining research, activism, and rights at the intersections of sexuality, health, and social justice","The Covid-19 pandemic inaugurated a new global order of public life and health marked by death, despair and alienation. As a crisis of a global scale, it made the task of (re)imagination simultaneously necessary and extremely difficult. It is this double bind of the difficulty and imminence of imagination that motivates the curation of this special issue. In this introduction, we map the connections between the theme of this volume and the key ideas that constitute its varied contributions, which we organised under three broad mobilising ideas: Rights and Resilience; Sexuality, Health and Justice; and Politics of Knowledge Production and Collaborations. Contributions cover myriad issues, engage in methodological innovations and play with diverse genres. Alongside more traditional academic writings, there are community-based research papers, activist conversations, visual essays, reflective pieces and interviews. The geographical span of the contributions brings insights from around the world and the number of topics covered in this issue are equally vast including, among others, mental health, disability, environment, sex work, violence, queerness, LGBTQ+ experiences, love and anger. The aim of this special issue, then, is to challenge the Manichean distinctions that are often drawn between research and activism, and by extension, between theory and practice.","Dutta, Murray, Oliveira, Parker","https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2022.2115097","20220830","Knowledge production; activism; participatory research; sexuality; social justice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36881,""
"Comprehensive Rehabilitation in Severely Ill Inpatients With COVID-19: A Cohort Study in a Tertiary Hospital","This study aimed to investigate the effects of comprehensive rehabilitation management on functional recovery and examine the correlation between clinical parameters and improvements in functional outcomes in severe-to-critical inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a tertiary hospital. Post-acute COVID-19 patients who had a World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale of 5-7, underwent intensive care, and received comprehensive rehabilitation management, including exercise programs, nutritional support, dysphagia evaluation, and psychological care were included. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), Medical Research Council sum score, handgrip strength, number of repetitions in the 1-minute sit-to-stand test, gait speed, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) were evaluated at hospital stay, discharge, and 1-month follow-up. The correlation between the rehabilitation dose and improvement in each outcome measure was analyzed. Overall, 37 patients were enrolled, of whom 59.5% and 32.4% had a score of 6 and 7 on the WHO ordinal scale, respectively. Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were 33.6 Ã‚Â± 23.9 and 63.8 Ã‚Â± 36.5 days. Outcome measures revealed significant improvements at discharge and 1-month follow-up. The SMI was significantly increased at the 1-month follow-up (6.13 [5.24-7.76]) compared with that during the hospital stay (5.80 [5.39-7.05]). We identified dose-response associations between the rehabilitation dose and FAC (ÃÂ = 0.46) and BBS (ÃÂ = 0.50) scores. Patients with older age, longer hospitalization, longer stay at the intensive care unit, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, a more depressive mood, and poorer nutritional status revealed poorer improvement in gait speed at the 1-month follow-up. Comprehensive rehabilitation management effectively improved muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in severe-to-critical COVID-19 patients. Dose-response relationship of rehabilitation and functional improvement emphasizes the importance of intensive post-acute inpatient rehabilitation in COVID-19 survivors.

"Suicide Attempts Assisted By Firefighters According to Traumatic Brain Injury","Studies worldwide have reported increasing trends in suicides and attempts during the pandemic. The literature shows that improving surveillance and monitoring of suicide and attempts requires broad multisectoral prevention strategies. In Brazil, the SÃƒÂ£o Paulo State Fire Department (CBPMESP) makes up the emergency response team for suicide and suicide attempted calls and public emergencies. Given this context, this paper sought to describe the characteristics of suicide attempts assisted by the CBPMESP according to traumatic brain injury (TBI), between 2018 and 2020, measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). For this purpose, a descriptive study of 6,582 suicide attempts attended by CBPMESP was carried out. The factors associated with trauma brain injury according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (dependent variable) were analyzed by a multinomial regression model. Results show a significant increase of 8.0% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.039) in the number of calls responded by CBPMESP between 2018 and 2020. Men presented a higher prevalence of more violent methods for suicide attempts, namely firearms and hanging, followed by severe TBI; in women, severe TBI occurred mostly by hanging. Despite the increase in fatal suicide attempts during the pandemic, time to attend to victim acted as a protective factor for preventing severe TBI in men and women.","de Almeida, de AraÃƒÂºjo, Munhoz, Andrade, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10935-022-00703-1","20220829","COVID-19; Coma; Fire Department; Prevention; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","",36883,""
