"Depression and suicidal ideation in Mexican medical students during COVID-19 outbreak A longitudinal study","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly difficult for populations at risk for mental health problems, such as healthcare professionals and medical students. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the pandemic on mental health in a sample of Mexican medical students with and without a mental health diagnosis. Method Longitudinal and descriptive study based on scales of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and risk of alcohol consumption, conducted in April and December 2020. Results Sample includes 247 medical students, 64.4% are women. Prevalence of depression increased between April and December from 19.84% to 40.08%. In the case of women from 23.67% to 42.60% (<U+03C7>2 = 0.000) and in men from 11.54% to 34.62% (<U+03C7>2 = 0.001). In April 16.92% of healthy students presented some sign of depression and in December the percentage increased to 40.80% (<U+03C7>2 = 0.000). Regarding medicated students, the prevalence in April was 32.61% and in December it was 36.96% (<U+03C7>2 = 0.662). In April, the medicated students with risk of suicidal ideation were 17 out of 46 (36.96%), compared to the students without a diagnosis of psychiatric illness were 29 out of 201 (13.43%) (<U+03C7>2 = 0.000). For December, the non-medicated students at risk of suicidal ideation were 34 out of 201 (16.91%), and the medicated students were 12 out of 46 (26.09%) (<U+03C7>2 = 0.149). Conclusions The pandemic has increase the rate of depression in medical students, being more severe in women. Students under psychiatric treatment showed a higher prevalence of depression; however, the fact of being under treatment resulted in a protective factor for the increase in the prevalence of depression. It is important to deepen the understanding of the causes of depression and to disseminate among the university community the benefits of early detection and treatment of people with socio-emotional disorders.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08851","20220201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-07","",26622,""
"Age and gender differences in loneliness during the COVID-19: Analyses on large cross-sectional surveys and emotion diaries","Loneliness level was shown to vary by age and gender. Considering the recent COVID-19 outbreak had more impact on the susceptible groupsâ€™ mental health, this study scrutinized the joint influence of age and gender on loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. We utilized large, government-funded public data that contains self-reported measures and emotion diaries collected from October 2020 to March 2021 (N=4,017, age 20-79, 76% female). Hierarchical regression, t-test, and analysis of variance examined the effect of age as a continuous or categorical variable and gender on loneliness. N-gram frequency analyses and topic modeling helped analyze the differences in expressions used by the age-gender groups in the diaries. Loneliness increased with age (p=0.043), and women were lonelier than men (p<0.001). However, age and gender interacted to predict loneliness (p=0.004), showing that younger women and older men experienced higher levels of loneliness. Age (p<0.001) and age-gender (p=0.030) interaction remained significant even with the presence of demographic and personality risk factors. When parceled by the age groups and gender, gender differences in loneliness level were significant within 20s (95% CI: Female [2.196, 2.264], Male [1.986, 2.133]) and 30s (95% CI: Female [2.390, 2.499], Male [2.071, 2.251]). In emotion diaries, all age-gender groups except women in their 60s-70s frequently expressed anxiety and depression. Women in their 20s talked more about work experiences and difficulties in job search, and women in their 30s wrote more about difficulties in childcare and lack of social connections. Spirituality was one of the major topics mentioned by women in their 50s and 60s-70s, but not by the other groups. The effects of age and gender on loneliness reflect social and psychological challenges in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to establish valid interventions targeted at younger women and older men.","Yoonwon Jung et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00F0-93C-CF5","20220207","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; big data; diary; covid-19; text mining; loneliness; machine learning; pandemic; nlp","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-07","",26623,""
