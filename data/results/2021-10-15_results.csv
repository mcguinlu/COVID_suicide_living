"COVID-19 and Mental Health: Predicted Mental Health Status is Associated with Clinical Symptoms and Pandemic-Related Psychological and Behavioral Responses","Abstract Background: The COVID 19 pandemic led to dramatic threats to health and social life. Study objectives are to develop a prediction model leveraging subsample of known Patient/Controls and evaluate the relationship of predicted mental health status to clinical outcome measures and pandemic-related psychological and behavioral responses during lockdown (spring/summer 2020). Methods: Online cohort study conducted by National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program. Convenience sample of English speaking adults (enrolled 4/4 to 5/16/20; n=1,992). Enrollment measures: demographics, clinical history, functional status, psychiatric and family history, alcohol/drug use. Outcome measures (enrollment and q2 weeks/6 months): distress, loneliness, mental health symptoms, and COVID 19 survey. NIMH IRP Patient/Controls survey responses informed assignment of Patient Probability Scores (PPS) for all participants. Regression models analyzed the relationship between PPS and outcome measures. Outcomes: Mean age 46.0, female (82.4%), white (88.9 %). PPS correlated with distress, loneliness, depression, and mental health factors. PPS associated with negative psychological responses to COVID 19. Worry about mental health (OR 1.46) exceeded worry about physical health (OR 1.13). PPS not associated with adherence to social distancing guidelines but was with stress related to social distancing and worries about infection of self/others. Interpretation: Mental health status (PPS) was associated with concurrent clinical ratings and COVID 19 specific negative responses. A focus on mental health during the pandemic is warranted, especially among those with mental health vulnerabilities. We will include PPS when conducting longitudinal analyses of mental health trajectories and risk and resilience factors that may account for differing clinical outcomes.

"Examining the Association between the COVID-19 Pandemic and Self-Harm Death Counts in Four Canadian Provinces","Governments implemented lockdowns and other physical distancing measures to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Resulting unemployment, income loss, poverty, and social isolation, coupled with daily reports of dire news about the COVID-19 pandemic, could serve as catalysts for increased self-harm deaths (SHD). This ecological study examined whether observed SHD counts were higher than predicted SHD counts during the pandemic period in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. The study also explored whether SHD counts during the pandemic were affected by lockdown severity (measured using the lockdown stringency index [LSI]) and COVID-19 case numbers. We utilized publicly available SHD data from January 2018 through November 2020, and employed AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling, to predict SHD during the COVID-19 period (March 21 to November 28, 2020). We used Poisson and negative binomial regression to assess ecological associations between the LSI and COVID-19 case numbers, controlling for seasonality, and SHD counts during the COVID-19 period. On average, observed SHD counts were lower than predicted counts during this period (p < 0.05 [except Alberta]). Additionally, LSI and COVID-19 case numbers were not statistically significantly associated with SHD counts.","Shelly Isnar; Mark Oremus","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.13.21264961","20211014","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18850,""
"Social and mental health risks faced by undocumented migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from three surveys in France","Background The often-precarious life circumstances of undocumented migrants are likely to heighten the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. Given the paucity of research exploring how undocumented migrants are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we set out to explore the association between being an undocumented migrant and a range of social and mental health measures. Methods Our study draws on three complementary surveys conducted among migrants in France between April 1st and June 7th 2020 (APART TOGETHER, MAKASI, ECHO; n = 716). We tested associations between eight outcome measures, covering health literacy, prevention behaviours, perceptions of government responses, livelihoods and mental health (PHQ-9 score), and the participants' legal status as either undocumented or documented. We modelled the probability of food insecurity increase, job loss, depression, and responses to SARS-COV-2 symptoms with logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender and legal status. Results Undocumented migrants had a higher probability of experiencing food insecurity increase (aORs=10.40 [3.59, 30.16], and 2.19 [1.39, 3.50] in APART TOGETHER and ECHO), a higher probability of depression (aOR=2.65 [1.01, 6.97] in MAKASI). In all three surveys, undocumented migrants were more likely to lose their job (aORs=6.51 [1.18, 36.00], 8.36 [1.08, 64.70] and 3.96 [1.79, 9.16] in APART TOGETHER, MAKASI and ECHO respectively). Conclusion Our results suggest that the lives of undocumented migrants have been dramatically worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, exposing and amplifying the inequalities facing this group. There is an urgent need for action to address these inequalities.","Anne Gosselin; Cecile Longchamps; Rachid Oulahal; Ilse Derluyn; Simon Ducarroz; Morten Skovdal; An Verelst; Gesine Sturm; Annabel Desgrees du Lou; Maria Melchior","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.14.21264999","20211014","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18851,""
"COVID-19 testing in schools: Perspectives of school administrators, teachers, parents, and students in Southern California","Background School-based COVID-19 testing is a potential strategy to facilitate the safe reopening of schools that have been closed due to the pandemic. This qualitative study assessed attitudes toward this strategy among four groups of stakeholders: school administrators, teachers, parents, and high school students. Methods Focus groups and interviews were conducted in Los Angeles from December 2020 to January 2021 when schools were closed due to the high level of COVID transmission in the community. Results Findings indicated similarities and differences in attitudes toward in-school COVID-19 testing. All groups agreed that frequent in-school COVID-19 testing could increase the actual safety and perceived safety of the school environment. School administrators and teachers expressed pessimism about the financial cost and logistics of implementing a testing program. Parents supported frequent testing but expressed concerns about physical discomfort and stigma for students who test positive. Teachers and parents noted that testing would prevent parents from sending sick children to school. Students were in favor of testing because it would allow them to return to in-person school after a difficult year of online learning. Conclusion In-school COVID-19 testing could be a useful component of school reopening plans and will be accepted by stakeholders if logistical and financial barriers can be surmounted and stigma from positive results can be minimized.","Jennifer B Unger; Daniel W Soto; Ryan Lee; Sohini Deva; Kush Shanker; Neeraj Sood; Howard Hu","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.14.21265000","20211014","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18852,""
"Impact of using wearable devices on psychological Distress: Analysis of the health information national Trends survey","This study explores the possible impact of wearables on psychological distress and their implications on designs. The study conceptualizes and tests two exploratory models by analyzing the US-based Health Information National Trends Survey of 2019 and 2020. Six variants from the databases were used in the study as predictors. We used models 4 and 6 of the Hayes PROCESS macros to test our conceptual parallel and sequential mediation models, respectively. The finding indicates significant and negative indirect effects of 'Use of wearable device' on 'Psychological distress.' In parallel mediation models, 'self-care' and 'health perception' were noted to be significant mediators. Wearable devices were associated with improved 'Health perception,' 'Self-care,' and longer 'workout duration,', which in turn helped reduce 'psychological distress' (better mental health). The sequential mediation model captured the indirect effect of 'Use of wearable device' on 'Psychological distress' when sequentially mediated by 'workout duration,' 'BMI,' 'self-care,' and 'health perception' in the given order. As the adoption of digital wearables is increasing due to their growing potential to augment physiological and psychosocial health, it is critical that these technologies are designed to address the needs of users from diverse backgrounds (race, education level, age).","Choudhury, Asan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104612","20211014","COVID-19; Digital health; Fitness tracker; Health perception; Mental health; Motivation Technology Model; Self Determination Theory; Self-management; e-health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18853,""
"Changes in social support of pregnant and postnatal mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Our objectives were to assess in perinatal women: the most effective methods used to meet social support needs during COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on self-reported social support levels, and how perceived change in social support related to distress, depression, and mental health. One-time survey administered from April to August 2020 SETTING: Online PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant and postpartum women with infants less than 6 months of age MEASUREMENT AND FINDINGS: Participants indicated the methods they used to meet social support needs during COVID-19. They self-rated their social support level pre- and during pandemic and their distress, depressive symptoms, and mental health changes on a Likert scale. Out of 1142 participants, the most effective methods for obtaining social support during the pandemic were virtual means (e.g. video call) and interaction with friends. There was a significant difference in distribution of self-reported levels of social support before and during the pandemic, with more respondents reporting a decrease in support. Decreases in social support were associated with higher distress levels, higher levels of depressive symptoms, and poorer mental health. Perinatal women reported decreased social support during the COVID-19 pandemic which was associated with poorer mental health. Using virtual means of social support and support provided by friends had the largest positive effect on perceived social support levels. Interventions using virtual support means from friends may be helpful to improve social support and mental health in this population.","Zhou, Havens, Starnes, Pickering, Brito, Hendrix, Thomason, Vatalaro, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.103162","20211014","Depression; Mental health; Pandemic; Perinatal; Postpartum; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18854,""
"Exploring the factors associated with the mental health of frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cyprus","The spread of COVID-19 into a global pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of frontline healthcare-workers. This study is a multi-centre, cross-sectional epidemiological study that uses nationwide data to assess the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and burnout among health care workers managing COVID-19 patients in Cyprus. The study also investigates the mechanism behind the manifestation of these pathologies, as to allow for the design of more effective protective measures. Data on the mental health status of the healthcare workers were collected from healthcare professionals from all over the nation, who worked directly with Covid patients. This was done via the use of 64-item, self-administered questionnaire, which was comprised of the DASS21 questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and a number of original questions. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate factors associated with each of the mental health measures. The sample population was comprised of 381 healthcare professionals, out of which 72.7% were nursing staff, 12.9% were medical doctors and 14.4% belonged to other occupations. The prevalence of anxiety, stress and depression among the sample population were 28.6%, 18.11% and 15% respectively. The prevalence of burnout was 12.3%. This was in parallel with several changes in the lives of the healthcare professionals, including; working longer hours, spending time in isolation and being separated from family. This study indicates that the mental health of a significant portion of the nation's workforce is compromised and, therefore, highlights the need for an urgent intervention particularly since many countries, including Cyprus, are suffering a second wave of the pandemic. The identified risk factors should offer guidance for employers aiming to protect their frontline healthcare workers from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kapetanos, Mazeri, Constantinou, Vavlitou, Karaiskakis, Kourouzidou, Nikolaides, Savvidou, Katsouris, Koliou","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258475","20211014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18855,""
"Patient attendance at a pediatric emergency referral hospital in an area with low COVID-19 incidence","The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of individual infection control measures and physical distancing on pediatric medical care in a local prefecture in Japan, where the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in pediatric patients was extremely low. We extracted data from hospital records on the number of outpatients, inpatients, infectious disease consultations, and consultations for representative pediatric diseases. We compared attendance in 2017-2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, with 2020, when COVID-19 spread to Japan. There were no COVID-19 patients in the pediatric department during the study period. The total number outpatient visits decreased by 24.4%, and the number of hospital admissions, excluding neonatal care unit admissions, decreased by approximately 35%. There was a marked reduction in the number of hospitalizations for infectious diseases such as influenza (-74.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus infection (-93.5%), and the number of hospitalizations for bronchitis/pneumonia, Kawasaki disease, and bronchial asthma decreased. In contrast, the number of clinical psychological interventions and cases reported to the child guidance center increased. In the context of pandemic infectious diseases, it is important to control the spread of problematic infectious diseases by individual infection control measures and physical distancing. However, it is necessary to maintain social life as much as possible for the mental health and physical development of children.","Shichijo, Takeuchi, Tayama, Takei, Fujioka, Ono, Shono, Suga, Kondo, Kaimen, Arima, Kondo","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258478","20211014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18856,""
"Psychological distress among healthcare providers during COVID-19 in Asia: Systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare providers (HCPs) globally. This review is aimed at determining the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, fear, burnout and resilience and its associated factors among HCPs in Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed literature search using 4 databases from Medline, Cinahl, PubMed and Scopus from inception up to March 15, 2021 and selected relevant cross-sectional studies. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plot. Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence while risk factors were reported in odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We included 148 studies with 159,194 HCPs and the pooled prevalence for depression was 37.5% (95%CI: 33.8-41.3), anxiety 39.7(95%CI: 34.3-45.1), stress 36.4% (95%CI: 23.2-49.7), fear 71.3% (95%CI: 54.6-88.0), burnout 68.3% (95%CI: 54.0-82.5), and low resilience was 16.1% (95%CI: 12.8-19.4), respectively. The heterogeneity was high (I2&gt;99.4%). Meta-analysis reported that both females (OR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.30-1.68) and nurses (OR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.02-1.45) were at increased risk of having depression and anxiety [(Female: OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.49-1.85), (Nurse: OR = 1.36; 95%CI = 1.16-1.58)]. Females were at increased risk of getting stress (OR = 1.59; 95%CI = 1.28-1.97). In conclusion, one third of HCPs suffered from depression, anxiety and stress and more than two third of HCPs suffered from fear and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia.","Ching, Ng, Lee, Yee, Lim, Ranita, Devaraj, Ooi, Cheong","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257983","20211014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18857,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 response on the provision of other public health services in the US: A cross sectional study","Funding and staff formerly dedicated to routine public health tasks (e.g., responding to communicable and non-communicable diseases, investigating foodborne outbreaks, conducting routine surveillance) and services (e.g., environmental health, substance abuse, maternal-child health) may no longer be available in many public health departments due to the COVID-19 response. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which staffing for essential public health services has been redirected to the COVID-19 response. This is a cross-sectional study using a survey distributed through the Qualtrics platform. Individuals (N = 298) working in public health across governmental and academic public health departments in the U.S. during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response were surveyed. Survey items measured multiple domains including professional experience (i.e., training, years of experience, content expertise, job functions, hours worked), mental and physical health status (i.e., generalized anxiety, depression, burnout), and career plans (i.e., pre-pandemic vs. current career plans). The total number of content expertise areas and programmatic functions covered by individual public health workers increased between January and September of 2020, with 26% (73 of 282) of respondents reporting an increase in both. The total number of respondents working in infectious disease and preparedness remained constant, while declines were reported in program evaluation (-36%) and health education (-27%) and increases were reported in disease investigation (+35%). The provision of many essential public health functions and tasks have been limited or eliminated while the U.S. public health workforce responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight opportunities for funding and professional development of public health systems, both during and after the COVID-19 response, to help ensure the continuity of essential public health services, staffing sustainability, and preparedness for future public health emergencies in the U.S.","Kintziger, Stone, Jagger, Horney","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255844","20211014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18858,""

Fifty-five articles qualified for the review. Health emergencies heighten gender inequalities in relation to income, employment, job security, and working conditions. Household stress and pandemic-related restrictions (social distancing, closure of services) increase women's vulnerability to violence. Systemic racism and discrimination intensify health disparities. Racialized women are experiencing a 2020 Syndemic: a convergence of COVID-19, GBV, and racism pandemics, placing their wellbeing at a disproportionate risk.

"Acceptability, Engagement, and Effects of a Mobile Digital Intervention to Support Mental Health for Young Adults Transitioning to College: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","The transition from high school to college can exacerbate mental health problems in young adults yet barriers prevent seamless mental health care. Existing digital support tools show promise but are not yet designed to optimize engagement or implementation. The goal of the research was to test acceptability and effects of an automated digital Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) for young adults transitioning to college. Youths aged 18 years and older with a current mental health diagnosis preparing to transition to college (n=52; 85% female [45/52], 91% White [48/52]) were recruited from a primary care (n=31) and a mental health clinic (n=21). Participants were randomized 2:1 to either receive MoST-MH (n=34) or enhanced Usual Care (eUC; n=18). MoST-MH included periodic text message and web-based check-ins of emotional health, stressors, negative impacts, and self-efficacy that informed tailored self-care support messages. Both eUC and MoST-MH participants received links to a library of psychoeducational videos and were asked to complete web-based versions of the Mental Health Self-Efficacy Scale (MHSES), College Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS), and Client Service Receipt Inventory for Mental Health (C-SRI) monthly for 3 months and the Post-Study System Usability Scale (PSSUQ) at 3-months. MoST-MH participants were sent a median of 5 (range 3 to 10) text message check-in prompts over the 3-month study period and 100% were completed; participants were sent a median of 2 (range 1 to 8) web-based check-in prompts among which 78% (43/55) were completed. PSSUQ scores indicate high usability (mean score 2.0). Results from the completer analysis demonstrated reductions in mental health symptoms over time and significant between-group effects of MoST-MH compared to eUC on depressive symptom severity (d=0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.64). No significant differences in mental health self-efficacy or mental health health care use were observed. In this pilot trial, we found preliminary evidence that MoST-MH was engaged with at high rates and found to be highly usable and reduced depression symptoms relative to eUC among youth with mental health disorders transitioning to college. Findings were measured during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the study was not powered to detect differences in outcomes between groups; therefore, further testing is needed.

"Stress symptoms and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a comparative study between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and typically developing children and adolescents","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related confinement severely impacted people wellbeing. Many studies focused on general population, although it is reasonable to expect that patients with neurodevelopmental disorders might have been at higher risk. Children/adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) might be potentially more vulnerable, due to their intolerance to forced restrictions that limit stimulating experiences, to obligation to follow instructions and to acceptation of imposed rules We aimed to compare stress-related behavioral changes of the first COVD-19 related confinement among 6-18 years old ADHD and typically developing subjects. Two parent-proxy online surveys have been employed, shared via social media. Symptoms of acute stress related to the pandemic and a question about family members/households' COVID-19 positivity have been listed in 8 yes/no items. Chi-squared tests were applied. Final sample consisted of 1078 typically developing subjects and 979 ADHD. Exaggerated startle response, difficulties in waking-up, angry mood as well as COVID-19 related fears were more prevalent among ADHD vs. typically developing subjects. typically developing subjects showed higher prevalence of research for information about COVID-19 and worries about death. In conclusion, the COVID-19 experience significantly impacted children and adolescents with ADHD to a great extent, similarly to typically developing subjects. ADHD showed more anxious-phobic responses, while typically developing subjects demonstrate more depressive attitudes. Differences in stress symptoms profiles between ADHD and T typically developing subjects warrant to develop distinct strategies of therapeutic interviews.","Giallonardo, Uccella, DE Carli, Nobili, Bruni, DE Grandis, Melegari","https://doi.org/10.23736/S2724-5276.21.06477-6","20211014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18864,""
"Mental health nurses' disaster nursing competencies: A cross-sectional study","The unprecedented and prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has escalated the gravity of disasters in the field of mental health. Nurses are health care providers who play a pivotal role in all phases of disaster management and psychiatric nurses are required to be prepared and equipped with competencies to respond to such disasters. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the effects of mental health nurses' professional quality of life on disaster nursing competencies. This study adhered to the STROBE checklist for observational research. Data were collected from 196 mental health nurses working in various settings, including hospitals and communities in South Korea. Compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue were measured using the Korean version of the Professional Quality of Life Scale. Disaster nursing competencies were measured using the Disaster Nursing Preparedness-Response Competencies Scale. Multiple regression analysis showed that compassion satisfaction (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.36, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) was the most potent predictor of disaster nursing competencies of mental health nurses, followed by participation in disaster nursing (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.15, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.023) and disaster nursing-related education (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.15, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.026); these factors explained 30.1% of the variance. Education programmes ensuring that mental health nurses are adequately prepared for disaster management should include theoretical content as well as simulation training using virtual situations that resemble actual disasters. Further, supportive leadership and work environments that encourage cohesive teamwork are needed to increase compassion satisfaction of nurses.","Jang, Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12944","20211014","compassion; disasters; mental health; nurses; psychiatric nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18865,""
"Online Learning Performances of Children and Adolescents With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To investigate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) core symptoms that impair executive function (EF), emotional state, learning motivation, and the family and parenting environment of children and adolescents with ADHD, both with and without severe difficulties. This will be explored within an online learning environment during the period of COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 183 ADHD children diagnosed using DSM-V criteria were selected and divided into 2 groups high difficulties during online learning (HDOL) and low difficulties during online learning (LDOL) according to the answer of Home Quarantine Investigation of the Pandemic (HQIP). The participants filled out a set of questionnaires to assess their emotional state and learning motivation, and their parents also filled out the questionnaires about ADHD core symptoms, EF, and family and parenting environment. Compared with ADHD children in the LDOL group, the children in the HDOL group had significant symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, oppositional defiant, behavioral and emotional problems according to the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP). They also had more severely impaired EF according to the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), more difficulties and disturbances in the family by the Chinese version of Family Environment Scale (FES-CV), and lower parenting efficacy and satisfaction by Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC). With regard to the self-rating questionnaires of children and adolescents, the HDOL group reported lower learning motivation according to the Students Learning Motivation Scale (SLMS). By Screening for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders and Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC), those in HDOL presented more negative emotions. The HDOL group spent significantly more time on both video games and social software per day and significantly less time on multiple activities per week, when compared to those in the LDOL group. This study demonstrated that ADHD children and adolescents with HDOL had more inattention-related behaviors, more severe emotional problems and EF impairment, weaker learning motivation, and poorer family and parenting environment. Meanwhile, digital media use should be supervised and appropriate extracurricular activities should be encouraged by parents and schools.","He, Shuai, Wang, Qiu, Wilson, Xia, Cao, Lu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211049065","20211014","ADHD; COVID-19; adolescents; children; online learning performance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18866,""
"Anxiety due to COVID-19 among healthcare providers during pandemic: A web-based cross-sectional survey in Iran","The main purpose of this study was to assess the levels of anxiety, depression, and stress among healthcare providers in Iran. This descriptive cross-sectional survey was performed on healthcare providers selected through the convenience sampling method from April 6 to May 19, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, a self-report web-based questionnaire made up of a sociodemographic characteristics information form, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) was distributed. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> ), and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were accordingly practiced to analyze the data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Of 1343 healthcare providers, 45.8% and 73.0% had moderate physical and psychological anxiety symptoms, respectively. The logistic regression model similarly demonstrated that anxiety caused by COVID-19 was significantly correlated with the age ranges of 41-50 (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .007) and 51-60 (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .014) years as well as male participants (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). In addition, the prevalence rates of depression and stress were, respectively, reported by 35.1% and 27.8%. There was correspondingly a significant relationship between depression and age as well as stress and gender. It seems that healthcare managers need to focus more attention on psychological aspects in healthcare providers during this pandemic and plan to teach them about coping strategies.","Kamali, Moosazadeh, Azizi, Ghasemian, Hasannezad Reskati, Elyasi","https://doi.org/10.1002/npr2.12213","20211014","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; healthcare workers; infection; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18867,""
"Latent Profile Analysis of Perceptions and Attitudes Towards COVID-19 in a Sample of Chinese People","<b>Background:</b> The novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) disease has spread quickly throughout China and around the world, endangering human health and life. Individuals' perceptions and attitudes as well as related health education measures may affect disease progression and prognosis during the COVID-19 outbreak. To promote and implement health education, research must focus on the perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 among Chinese people. The present study aimed to examine the profiles and predictive factors of the perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 in a sample of Chinese people. <b>Methods:</b> A sample of 2,663 Chinese people comprising medical staff and members of the general public completed an online survey on Wenjuanxing. The survey measured demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, education level, and place of residence) and perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19. <b>Results:</b> Two profiles of perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 (positive and negative perceptions and attitudes) were identified in the sample. Place of residence during the COVID-19 pandemic and first response to COVID-19 were found to be independent predictive factors for COVID-19 related perceptions and attitudes. <b>Conclusion:</b> In addition to drug therapy and mental health services, the perceptions and attitudes of Chinese people towards COVID-19 should be considered when promoting health education during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Niu, Li, Li, Mei, Jiang, Deng, Xin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.727242","20211014","COVID-19; Chinese people; attitude; latent profile analysis; perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18868,""
"Persistent Raynaud's Phenomenon Following Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a medical condition characterized by vasospasm of the digital vessels in the fingers and toes. The prevalence of RP in the general population is estimated at 3-5% and can vary based on climate.Ã‚Â It is classified into primary and secondary RP based on causality. RP has been reported in some cases diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We report the case of a 14-year-old Caucasian female who presented during the pandemic with chief complaints of suicidal ideations and attempted suicide and had a history of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and persistent RP after a stimulant trial. After an initialÃ‚Â failure of treatment with lisdexamfetamine, she wasÃ‚Â switched to methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH).Ã‚Â Within two months of starting MPH, the patient noticed skin discoloration of the lower legs and feet along with numbness. The discoloration of skin was mainly limited to her feet and gradually moved up her legs. She was advised to discontinue the MPH, but her symptoms persistedÃ‚Â for four more months until her admission. Other etiologies were ruled out by multi-specialties and during her hospitalization. She was started on atomoxetine and buspirone with appropriate dose titration. Post-discharge from the hospital,Ã‚Â no improvement was observed in the patient's RP at an outpatient follow-up performed within a month. The development of RP following MPH treatment and its persistence after stopping MPH is a fascinating event.Ã‚Â Clinicians should be aware of the potential rare side effects of stimulants and stimulant-like medications, including vascular, hematological, and dermatological effects. Adolescents with ADHD may be particularly distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic and display increased behavioral issues. Stress can be a trigger for RP; therefore, minimizing stress in at-risk patients is essential.","Laboe, Batchelder, Vasireddy","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17647","20211014","adhd; covid-19; methylphenidate hydrochloride; raynaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s phenomenon; stimulant; suicide and depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18869,""
"Capturing the Experiences and Challenges of Emerging Adults in College During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Emerging adulthood (ages 18-30 years) coincides with ""aging out"" of pediatric care. As a result, combined internal medicine and pediatrics (Med-Peds) providers are tasked with promoting the health and well-being of this population during and post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In order to inform the response efforts, we aimed to capture emerging adults' COVID-19 experiences and challenges during a two-week period of the pandemic in June 2020. We administered items from the California Health Interview Survey and an open-ended qualitative item via Qualtrics to 242 diverse emerging adults enrolled in a large USÃ‚Â public university (mean age = 20.10, SD = 1.26). More than 90% of all students reported that they or their families or close friends experienced difficulties coping with the stressors and challenges presented by COVID-19.

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients admitted to three isolation facilities in Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic can impose a profound impact on the mental health of hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no studies that explored the psychological distress of the COVID-19 inpatients in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and explore the associated factors among inpatients with COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 138 COVID-19 patients admitted to three isolation facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from September to October 2020. Participants' sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to analyse the data. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 57.2% (95% CI: 48.2-65.2) and 52.2% (95% CI: 43.8-62.7), respectively.

"Hitting Close to Home: The Effect of COVID-19 Illness in the Social Environment on Psychological Burden in Older Adults","This study examines the impact of COVID-19 experience of infection in the individual's social environment on psychological burden controlling for a broad range of factors using data on an older population (50+ years). Based on the empirical evidence of preexisting studies, it is hypothesized that psychological burden will increase concurrent to the severity of COVID-19 experience (tested positive, hospitalized, and death) independent of the other stressors resulting from the pandemic, such as a subjective sense of uncertainty or financial burden. Data of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in EUROPE, and a European cross-national panel study were used to examine this hypothesis. Besides Chi<sup>2</sup> test and Spearman's rho, a logistic regression model was constructed to test the hypothesized model. The study confirms that there is significantly higher risk for psychological burden by heightened COVID-19 severity in the social environment independent of multiple also significantly influential variables depicting stressors to everyday life of older people during the pandemic. The results point to the importance of multiple factors (social, financial, health, and sociodemographic) which have significantly affected the psychological condition of the individual during the past year. Conclusively, the results illustrate the dilemma that infection and illness in the social circle, as well as countermeasures (social distancing), have negative consequences for our mental health.","Richter, Heidinger","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.737787","20211014","COVID-19; depression and anxiety; effects of the pandemic on mental health; older adults; psychological burden; secondary traumatic stress; social environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18873,""

"Passive social media use and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of social comparison and emotion regulation","Social media browsing is commonly seen as a trigger of unhealthy social comparison (i.e., upward contrast), which negatively affects well-being. One underlying assumption is the predominance of positive self-presentation on social media, which may have shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic when negative disclosures have become more prevalent. In this study, we conceptualize social comparison as a multi-dimensional construct based on different comparing targets and processes, and explore how individual (i.e., cognitive reappraisal) and contextual (i.e., quarantine status) factors may influence the relationships among passive social media use, social comparison and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on a survey with 1131 Wuhan residents in China, we found that passive social media use was positively related to both upward contrast and downward identification, which in turn predicted a higher level of stress. Cognitive reappraisal was negatively associated with unhealthy social comparison (i.e., upward contrast and downward identification) but was positively related to healthy social comparison such as upward identification. Quarantined people tended to report more upward contrast, especially when they engaged in more frequent social media browsing. This study contributes to the larger debate about the impact of social media on mental health and offers practical implications.","Yue, Zhang, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.107050","20211014","COVID-19; Cognitive reappraisal; Quarantine; Social comparison; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18875,""
"Psychological risks to mother-infant bonding during the COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this study was to examine the association between mental health symptoms, along with psychological experiences and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related concerns, and self-reported maternal-infant bonding experiences of postpartum women. Using data collected from May 19 to August 17, 2020, this cross-sectional online study assessed 429 women to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemicÃ‚Â on women during the postpartum period. Enrolled respondents were asked to participate in a 30-45-min online survey about COVID-19-related experiences, pregnancy, stress, and well-being. Postpartum women's depressive symptoms were related to lower quality maternal-infant bonding, but the anxiety symptoms were not associated with bonding. Maternal self-efficacy, but not social support, was associated with mothers' higher quality of maternal-infant bonding. COVID-19-related grief was significantly associated with lower qualityÃ‚Â bonding. On the other hand, COVID-19-related health worries were associated with higher quality of maternal-infant bonding. We describe potential psychological risk factors to maternal-infant bonding among postpartum women during the pandemic period. To best support the medical and psychological well-being of the mothers and infants, enhanced interdisciplinary partnerships among perinatal healthcare professionals involved in primary and/or specialty care is needed. Unique COVID-19-related health and grief concerns exist, with implications for maternal-infant bonding. Depression but not anxiety is associated with lower maternal-infant bonding. Caregiving confidence, but not social support, is associated with higher maternal-infant bonding. It is critical to screen for postpartum depression and COVID-19-related grief during maternal follow-up and pediatric visits. Study findings inform and prioritize pediatric interventions toward enhancing maternal-infant bonding during the COVID-19 era.","Liu, Hyun, Mittal, Erdei","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-021-01751-9","20211014","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18876,""
"The Effects of Stress on Glycemic Control Brought on by Changes in Social Conditions due to COVID-19","Objective The stress brought on by changes in social conditions due to COVID-19 is diverse. However, there have been no studies examining the relationship between the type of stress felt by an individual due to such changes in social conditions and the degree of change in HbA1c, prompting us to conduct this study. Methods We conducted a collaborative study at two diabetes clinics. A total of 1,000 subjects responded to the questionnaire. Data on HbA1c and body weight before and after the declaration of the state of emergency were collected. Results We conducted a questionnaire on some stressors, but when comparing the two groups with respect to whether or not they felt stress from each item, only ""school closures for children,"" seemed to be associated with a significant difference in the amount of change in HbA1c. In the stressed group, i.e. the group of parents who experienced stress due to their children's schools being closed, the HbA1c value changed from 7.30Ã‚Â±0.78 to 7.30Ã‚Â±1.13 (p=0.985). By contrast, in the unstressed group, the HbA1c value significantly decreased from 7.28Ã‚Â±0.98 to 7.06Ã‚Â±0.85 (p&lt;0.001). In addition, as a result of comparing the amount of change between the 2 groups, a significant decrease was observed in the unstressed group compared with the stressed group (p=0.032).

"Neuroimmune multi-hit perspective of coronaviral infection","It is well accepted that environmental stressors experienced over a one's life, from microbial infections to chemical toxicants to even psychological stressors, ultimately shape central nervous system (CNS) functioning but can also contribute to its eventual breakdown. The severity, timing and type of such environmental ""hits"", woven together with genetic factors, likely determine what CNS outcomes become apparent. This focused review assesses the current COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of a multi-hit framework and disuses how the SARS-COV-2 virus (causative agent) might impact the brain and potentially interact with other environmental insults. What the long-term consequences of SAR2 COV-2 upon neuronal processes is yet unclear, but emerging evidence is suggesting the possibility of microglial or other inflammatory factors as potentially contributing to neurodegenerative illnesses. Finally, it is critical to consider the impact of the virus in the context of the substantial psychosocial stress that has been associated with the global pandemic. Indeed, the loneliness, fear to the future and loss of social support alone has exerted a massive impact upon individuals, especially the vulnerable very young and the elderly. The substantial upswing in depression, anxiety and eating disorders is evidence of this and in the years to come, this might be matched by a similar spike in dementia, as well as motor and cognitive neurodegenerative diseases.","Hayley, Sun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-021-02282-0","20211014","ACE2; COVID19; Microglia; Neurodegeneration; Stress; Viral","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18878,""
"Covid-19 crisis impact on the next generation of physicians: a survey of 800 medical students","Many initiatives have emerged worldwide to handle the surge of hospitalizations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In France, the University of Paris North called on its medical students, whose status makes them integral members of the healthcare staff, to volunteer in their capacity of medical students and/or as nurses/nursing aids in understaffed intensive care units and other Covid-19 services. We attempted to evaluate their commitment, whether the pandemic affected their certainty for the medical profession and career choices, and how they scored their sadness and anxiety levels. The University of Paris North took a weekly official census of the involvement of 1205 4th-6th year medical students during the first lockdown in France. Six weeks after the lockdown began (May 4th), an e-questionnaire was sent to 2145 2nd-6th year medical students. The survey lasted 4Ã‚Â weeks and documented volunteering by medical students, the association between the pandemic and certainty for their profession, their choice of medical specialty and factors that influenced sadness and anxiety scores. 82% of 4th-6th year medical students volunteered to continue their internship or be reassigned to COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°units. Of 802 2nd-6th year students who completed the e-questionnaire, 742 (93%) volunteered in Covid-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°units, of which half acted as nurses. This engagement reinforced the commitment of 92% of volunteers to become physicians. However, at the peak of the outbreak, 17% had doubts about their ability to be physicians, while 12% reconsidered their choice of future specialty. Finally, 38% of students reported a score of 7/10 or more on the sadness scale, and 43% a score of 7/10 or more for anxiety. Neither study year nor service influenced sadness or anxiety scores. However, gender influenced both, with women scoring significantly higher than men (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). Medical students of the University of Paris North who made an early and unconditional commitment to help hospital staff handle the pandemic constituted a powerful healthcare reserve force during the crisis. Although the vast majority remained convinced that they want to become physicians, this experience came at a significant psychological cost, especially for women. Alleviating this cost would improve future crisis responses.","Passemard, Faye, Dubertret, Peyre, Vorms, Boimare, Auvin, Flamant, Ruszniewski, Ricard","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02955-7","20211014","Covid-19; Medical students; Volunteering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18879,""
"'Fix the issues at the coalface and mental wellbeing will be improved': a framework analysis of frontline NHS staff experiences and use of health and wellbeing resources in a Scottish health board area during the COVID-19 pandemic","Frontline healthcare staff working in pandemics have been reported to experience mental health issues during the early and post-peak stages. To alleviate these problems, healthcare organisations have been providing support for their staff, including organisational, cognitive behavioural and physical and mental relaxation interventions. This paper reports the findings of a study commissioned by a Scottish NHS health board area during the initial outbreak of COVID-19. The study aimed to understand the experience of NHS staff relating to the provision of wellbeing interventions between March and August 2020. Data were gathered from free-text comments of eight surveys completed by a wide range of staff across sites within one NHS health board in Scotland. We conducted a framework analysis of the data. Our findings show that despite the provision of relaxational and cognitive behavioural interventions to support staff wellbeing during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were barriers to access, including heavy workload, understaffing, inconvenient locations and the stigma of being judged. Organisational factors were the most frequently reported support need amongst frontline staff across sites. While relaxational and cognitive behavioural interventions were well received by staff, barriers to accessing them still existed. Staff support in the context of organisational factors, such as engagement with managers was deemed as the most important for staff wellbeing. Managers play a key role in everyday organisational processes and therefore are in the right position to meet increasing frontline staff demands due to the pandemic and removing barriers to accessing wellbeing support. Healthcare managers should be aware of organisational factors that might increase job demands and protect organisational resources that can promote wellbeing for frontline staff.","Clarissa, Quinn, Stenhouse","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07103-x","20211014","COVID-19; Employees; Health facilities; Healthcare; Staff health; Staff support; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18880,""
"Associations between psychological wellbeing, depression, general anxiety, perceived social support, tooth brushing frequency and oral ulcers among adults resident in Nigeria during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","The aims of this study were to determine the associations between psychological wellbeing, and the frequency of tooth brushing and presence of oral ulcers during the COVID-19 pandemic; and to identify the mediating roles of psychological distress (general anxiety and depression) and perceived social support in the paths of observed associations. This cross-sectional study recruited 996 adults in Nigeria between June and August 2020. Data collected through an online survey included outcome variables (decreased frequency of tooth brushing and presence of oral ulcers), explanatory variable (psychological wellbeing), mediators (general anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and perceived social support) and confounders (age, sex at birth, educational and employment status). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the risk indicators for the outcome variables. A path analysis was conducted to identify the indirect effect of mediators on the association between the outcome and explanatory variables. Of the 966 respondents, 96 (9.9%) reported decreased tooth-brushing frequency and 129 (13.4%) had oral ulcers during the pandemic. The odds of decreased tooth-brushing during the pandemic decreased as the psychological wellbeing increased (AOR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.83-0.91; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and as generalized anxiety symptoms increased (AOR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86-0.98; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.009). The odds of having an oral ulcer was higher as the generalized anxiety symptoms increased (AOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 01.08-1.21; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Only generalized anxiety (indirect effect: 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01-0.04; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014) significantly mediated the relationship between wellbeing and tooth-brushing accounting for approximately 12% of the total effect of wellbeing on decreased toothbrushing. Generalized anxiety (indirect effect 0.05; 95% CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07-0.03; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) also significantly mediated the relationship between wellbeing and presence of oral ulcer accounting for 70% of the total effect of wellbeing on presence of oral ulcer. Depressive symptoms and perceived social support did not significantly mediate the associations between psychological wellbeing, decreased frequency of tooth brushing and the presence of oral ulcers. Patients who come into the dental clinic with poor oral hygiene or oral ulcers during the COVID-19 pandemic may benefit from screening for generalized anxiety and psychological wellbeing to identify those who will benefit from interventions for mental health challenges.","Folayan, Ibigbami, Oloniniyi, Oginni, Aloba","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01871-y","20211014","Adults; Mental health; Nigeria; Oral Health; Psychological wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18881,""
"Maternal Mental Health in Africa During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Neglected Global Health Issue","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted mental health and wellbeing profoundly around the globe. Public health measures to control the virus's rapid spread, such as physical distancing, social isolation, lockdown, restricted movements, and quarantine, caused fear and panic in the general population. Although pandemic-related stressors have been reported, changes that occur during the perinatal period compounded by those made to obstetric care guidelines may put pregnant and postpartum mothers at increased risk of poor mental health. While an abundance of research exists in developed nations such as Europe and America, examining the impact of the pandemic on maternal mental health, very few studies have investigated the same in the African continent. Considering that poor maternal mental health has lifelong adverse consequences not only on the mothers but on the family and society and given that the African region has prominently weak health systems, high poverty rates, and unreliable maternal care, it is expected that the burden of the pandemic on maternal mental health will be more pronounced in Africa than in other regions. As such, multipronged mental health interventions and strategies that consider the heterogeneity within and between the African region must be developed. Doing so will close existing and widening global health disparities to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.","Ajayi, Wachira, Suleman, Bolarinwa","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021078","20211014","Africa; Coronavirus; mental health; postpartum women; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","",18882,""
