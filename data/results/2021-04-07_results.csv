"Monitoring the opioid epidemic via social media discussions","The opioid epidemic persists in the United States; in 2019, annual drug overdose deaths increased by 4.6% to 70,980, including 50,042 opioid-related deaths. The widespread abuse of opioids across geographies and demographics and the rapidly changing dynamics of abuse require reliable and timely information to monitor and address the crisis. Social media platforms include petabytes of participant-generated data, some of which, offers a window into the relationship between individuals and their use of drugs. We assessed the utility of Reddit data for public health surveillance, with a focus on the opioid epidemic. We built a natural language processing pipeline to identify opioid-related comments and created a cohort of 1,689,039 geo-located Reddit users, each assigned to a city and state. We followed these users over a period of 10+ years and measured their opioid-related activity over time. We benchmarked the activity of this cohort against CDC overdose death rates for different drug classes and NFLIS drug report rates. Our Reddit-derived rates of opioid discussion strongly correlated with external benchmarks on the national, regional, and city level. During the period of our study, kratom emerged as an active discussion topic; we analyzed mentions of kratom to understand the dynamics of its use. We also examined changes in opioid discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic; in 2020, many opioid classes showed marked increases in discussion patterns. Our work suggests the complementary utility of social media as a part of public health surveillance activities.","Adam Lavertu; Tymor Carpenter Hamamsy; Russ B.

"Experiences of coping with the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Philadelphia, PA: Mixed methods analysis of a cross-sectional survey of worries and symptoms of mood disorders","Our objective was to describe how residents of Philadelphia, PA, coped psychologically with the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. In a cross-sectional design, we aimed to estimate the rates and correlates of anxiety and depression, examine how specific worries correlated with general anxiety and depression, and synthesized themes of ""the most difficult experiences"" shared by the respondents. We collected data through an on-line survey in a convenience sample of 1,293 adult residents of Philadelphia, PA between April 17 and July 3, 2020, inquiring about symptoms of anxiety and depression (via Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), specific worries, open-ended narratives of ""the most difficult experiences"" (code into themes), demographics, perceived sources of support, and general health. Anxiety was evident among 30 to 40% of participants and depression -- about 10%. Factor analysis revealed two distinct, yet inter-related clusters of specific worries related to mood disorders: concern about ""hardships"" and ""fear of infection"". Regression analyses revealed that anxiety, depression, and fear of infection, but not concern about hardships, worsened over the course of the epidemic. ""The most difficult experiences"" characterized by loss of income, poor health of self or others, uncertainty, death of a relative or a friend, and struggle accessing food were each associated with some of the measures of worries and mood disorders. Respondents who believed they could reply on support of close personal network fared better psychologically than those who reported replying primarily on government and social services organizations. Thematic analysis revealed complex perceptions of the pandemic by the participants, giving clues to both positive and negative experiences that may have affected how they coped with the pandemic. Despite concerns about external validity, our observations are concordant with emerging evidence of psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures employed to mitigate risk of infection.","Igor Burstyn; Tran Huynh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.31.21254725","20210406","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12602,""
"Trends in mental health symptoms, service use, and unmet need for services among US adults through the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to rising morbidity, mortality, and social and economic disruption, likely impairing mental health. The purpose of this study was to track trends in mental health symptoms, use of services, and unmet need for services among U.S. adults and to delineate variation across demographic strata. Data were drawn from the 2020 U.S. Household Pulse Survey from repeated cross-sectional online surveys collected between April 23 and November 23, 2020 from 1,483,378 US adults, weighted to represent the U.S. population. Survey respondents self-reported their symptoms of anxiety and depression, use of medication, counseling services, and unmet need for services. Reports of probable anxiety and depression rose significantly through the study period, to prevalence rates of 50% and 44%, respectively, by November 2020, rates six times higher than early 2019 U.S. norms. Use of prescription medication, counseling services, and unmet need for mental health services also rose significantly. Prevalence rates of probable mental health disorders were highest among young, less educated, single, female, Black and Hispanic respondents, with age and education disparities growing over cohorts. Young, female, and moderately educated respondents also reported higher unmet needs for services. Disparities in estimates of mental health disorders and mental health treatment indicate a striking disequilibrium between the potential need for and the use of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women, with the potential for expanded interruptions to optimal functioning and societal recovery from COVID-19. The myriad stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have impaired mental health and well-being. Although evidence from early in the pandemic revealed elevated rates of mental health conditions, research has not documented whether psychological disorders have continued to rise as the pandemic has persisted. In this research, we assess data from nearly 1.5 million U.S. adults who participated in cross-sectional surveys each week from April through November 2020 to track trends in mental health disorder symptoms and services. Our results show that reports of anxiety and depression rose significantly from April to November 2020 to rates six times higher than in 2019. We also found evidence of growing unmet need for mental health services. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women. Growing disparities in mental health disorders and treatment raise concerns for psychological, social, and economic recovery from COVID-19.","Coley, Baum","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab030","20210406","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Disparities; Mental health treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12603,""

"Rise in Use of Digital Mental Health Tools and Technologies in the US During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Accompanying the rising rates of reported mental distress during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a reported increase by the media in use of digital technologies to manage health generally, and mental health more specifically. The objective of the study was to systematically examine COVID-19 pandemic-related increase in self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. We analyzed results from a survey of 5,907 individuals in the U.S. using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) collected across all 50 states and Washington D.C. during four week-long periods in 2020. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per ten people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage one's mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per ten people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio (OR)=2.06, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=[1.27,3.35]), but not anxiety (OR=1.21, 95% CI=[0.77,1.88]). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR=1.19, 95% CI=[1.12,1.27] and OR=1.12, 95% CI=[1.05,1.19], respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR=2.70, 95% CI=[1.49,4.88]), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR=2.60, 95% CI=[1.55,4.34]). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR=1.20, 95% CI=[1.11,1.30]), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR=1.20, 95% CI=[1.10,1.31]); and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR=1.12, 95% CI=[1.05,1.19]). Interactions between COVID-19 case rate and mental health symptoms were not significantly associated with any of the technology types. Findings suggested increased use of digital mental health tools and other technologies over time during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, additional effort is urgently needed to consider the quality of these products, either by ensuring users have access to evidence-based and evidence-informed technologies and/or providing them with the skills to make informed decisions around their potential efficacy.","Sorkin, Janio, Eikey, Schneider, Davis, Schueller, Stadnick, Zheng, Neary, Safani, Mukamel","https://doi.org/10.2196/26994","20210406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12605,""
"Multinational Study to Assess Stress Levels Among the Health Care Workers of Radiation Oncology Community at the Outset of the COVID-19 Pandemic","To evaluate stress levels among the health care workers (HCWs) of the radiation oncology community in Asian countries. HCWs of the radiation oncology departments from 29 tertiary cancer care centers of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Nepal were studied from May 2020 to July 2020. A total of 758 eligible HCWs were identified. The 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, and 22-Item Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify the causative factors affecting mental health. A total of 758 participants from 794 HCWs were analyzed. The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-28). The incidence of moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress was 34.8%, 31.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. Severe personal concerns were noticed by 60.9% of the staff. On multivariate analysis, the presence of commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 during the previous 2 weeks, contact history (harzard ratio [HR], 2.04; CI, 1.15 to 3.63), and compliance with precautionary measures (HR, 1.69; CI, 1.19 to 2.45) for COVID-19 significantly predicted for increasing anxiety (HR, 2.67; CI, 1.93 to 3.70), depression (HR, 3.38; CI 2.36 to 4.84), and stress (HR, 2.89; CI, 1.88 to 4.43) (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). A significant regional variation was also noticed for anxiety, stress, and personal concerns. This survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a significant proportion of HCWs in the radiation oncology community experiences moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. This trend is alarming and it is important to identify and intervene at the right time to improve the mental health of HCWs to avoid any long-term impacts.","Wadasadawala, Kumar, Laskar, Gondhowiardjo, Mokal, Goswami, Giselvania, Kapoor, Das, Pradhan, Pujari, Acharya, Chapagain, Mahantshetty, Vadgaonkar, Hussain, Akbarov, Agarwal","https://doi.org/10.1200/GO.20.00647","20210406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12606,""
"Postpartum during COVID-19 pandemic: Portuguese mothers' mental health, mindful parenting, and mother-infant bonding","Millions of people worldwide have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has impacted maternal mental health and mother-infant relationships during the postpartum period. To explore how mothers' anxious and depressive symptoms, parenting stress, mindful parenting, and mother-infant bonding vary as a function of the moment of the baby's birth (pre-COVID-19 or post-COVID-19) and to examine the contribution of those variables to mother-infant bonding. The sample was recruited online and comprises 567 mothers (18-46 years) with an infant aged between 0 and 12 months old. Approximately 27.5% of the mothers presented clinically significant levels of anxious and depressive symptoms. Mothers who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic presented lower levels of Emotional Awareness of the Child and a more impaired mother-infant bonding than mothers who gave birth before the pandemic started. Approximately 49% of the mother-infant bonding variance was explained by parenting stress and by several dimensions of mindful parenting.

"Neuropathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019: neuroinflammation and blood brain barrier disruption are critical pathophysiological processes that contribute to the clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has infected several millions of people, resulting in a huge socioeconomic cost and over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Though the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood, data have consistently shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has implicated the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, however, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced impairment of the central nervous system are not completely known. Here, we review the literature on possible neuropathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced cerebral damage. The results suggest that downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with increased activity of the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion may result in upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and reactive species that trigger neuroinflammatory response and blood brain barrier disruption. Furthermore, dysregulation of hormone and neurotransmitter signalling may constitute a fundamental mechanism involved in the neuropathogenic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The viral RNA or antigenic peptides also activate or interact with molecular signalling pathways mediated by pattern recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors), nuclear factor kappa B, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, complement cascades, and cell suicide molecules. Potential molecular targets and therapeutics of SARS-CoV-2 induced neurologic damage are also discussed.","Welcome, Mastorakis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-021-00806-x","20210406","Blood brain barrier disruption; COVID-19; Neuroinfection; Neuroinflammation; Neuropathogenesis; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12608,""

At present, there are no International Classification of Disease (ICD) billing codes for this condition. Without financial alignment, clinicians cannot diagnose PICS, hindering tracking of its prevalence and impeding policy development for this condition. Clinicians should be screening for PICS in all survivors of critical illness, particularly those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Results from single-center studies suggest over 75 percent of ARDS survivors develop PICS. With nearly 5 percent of patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission for ARDS, it is important for clinicians to be able to diagnose PICS in survivors, and researchers to be able to track it.

We recruited research participants via disseminating an electronic survey on Facebook Messenger (FM) that included 812 participants. The electronic survey assessed unidentifiable demographic information, the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S; Arpaci et al., 2020) and the BriefÃ‚Â Resilience Scale (BRS; Smith et al, 2008). Based on simple linear regression, resilience had a statistically significant negative affect on all four C19P factors including psychological, psychosomatic, economic and social factors (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Resilience showed a statistically significant difference for at least two nations (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) investigated in this research, as shown by using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

"Policy preferences in response to negative economic prospects of COVID-19: A survey-experiment among local politicians in four European countries","This study investigates how the negative economic prospects of the COVID-19 pandemic affect local government politicians' policy preferences in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Spain. The study examines to what extent politicians prefer increasing the role of government (directive state), transferring public tasks to private sector organizations (hollow state), transferring public tasks to third sector organizations (communitarian state), or downsizing and reducing the role of government without transferring tasks (coping state). The experiment primes decision-makers on the pandemic's negative financial and economic prospects vis-ÃƒÂ -vis its impact on health and well-being. When negative economic prospects are emphasized, the study finds decreased preferences for a directive state and increased preferences for a coping state. The study concludes that how decision-makers interpret the nature of a crisis determines their preferred response: An emphasis on the negative economic prospects of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase preferences for renewed policies of austerity.","van der Voet","https://doi.org/10.1111/padm.12729","20210406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12614,""

The Model for Improvement was used as the systematic approach for this project. Baseline assessment included observations in the dining room, gathering of qualitative feedback from staff and patients and the development of an ED behaviours form used by patients and staff. The first change idea of a host role in the dining room was introduced, and the impact was assessed. The introduction of the host role has reduced the average number of ED behaviours per patient in the dining room by 35%. Postintervention feedback demonstrated that the introduction of the host role tackled the disorganisation and chaotic feeling in the dining room which in turn has reduced distress and anxiety for patients and staff. This paper shows the realities of a quality improvement (QI) project on an ED inpatient unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are positive for changes made; however, a large challenge, as described has been staff engagement.","Gardner, Trueman","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001366","20210406","healthcare quality improvement; mental health; patient participation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12615,""
"Subjective wellbeing in parents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","To examine (1) the subjective wellbeing of Australian parents raising children and adolescents (0-18Ã‚Â years) during April 2020 'stage three' COVID-19 restrictions, in comparison with parents assessed over 18-years prior to the pandemic; and (2) socio-demographic and COVID-19 predictors of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic. Cross-sectional data were from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2365 parents of a child 0-18Ã‚Â years, 8-28th April 2020); and a pre-pandemic national database containing 18Ã‚Â years of annual surveys collected in 2002-2019 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 17,529 parents). Levels of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic were considerably lower than ratings prior to the pandemic (Personal Wellbeing Index, mean[SD]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 65.3 [17.0]; compared to [SD]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 75.8 [11.9], pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). During the pandemic, lower subjective wellbeing was associated with low education (adjusted regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -5.19, -0.93), language other-than-English (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -7.22, -1.30), government benefit (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -6.99, -0.96), single parents (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -8.84, -4.59), child neurodevelopmental condition (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -3.44, -0.76), parent physical/mental health problems (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -3.23, -0.67), COVID-environmental stressors (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -3.48, -2.44), and fear/worry about COVID-19 (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -8.13, -5.96). Unexpectedly, parent engagement with news media about the pandemic was associated with higher subjective wellbeing (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.35, 1.61). Subjective wellbeing in parents raising children aged 0-18Ã‚Â years appears to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions in Australia. Specific at-risk groups, for which government intervention may be warranted, include parents in socially disadvantaged contexts, parents with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and parents facing significant COVID-19-related work changes.","Westrupp, Stokes, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Berkowitz, Capic, Khor, Greenwood, Mikocka-Walus, Sciberras, Youssef, Olsson, Hutchinson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110482","20210406","Australia; COVID-19 pandemic; Families; Parent; Subjective wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12616,""
"Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes: Results from a Tertiary Referral Hospital in Lebanon during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has caused global mental health impacts, and healthcare workers (HCWs) face an increased risk of exposure to the disease when compared to the general population. This study aimed to assess factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at a tertiary hospital, in Lebanon between June and July 2020. The survey included data on demographics, exposure to COVID-19, preparedness to COVID-19 outbreak, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and mental health dimensions. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to understand the association among these variables. One hundred and ninety-three of 1,600 Lebanese HCWs participated. More than 80% reported high preparedness levels towards the COVID-19 outbreak, 69% believed that their job was putting them at risk, and 70% altruistically accepted these risks. Anxiety and depression symptomatology were present in 24% and 23% of HCWs; who were more likely to feel more stress at work (83% vs 60%; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.004; 82% vs 61%; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.01, respectively), feel afraid of falling ill (72% vs 55%; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.03; 77% vs 54%; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.01, respectively), fear death (21% vs 7%; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.01; 25% vs 6%; <i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.001, respectively), and believed that people avoided their families (39% vs 21%; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.01; 35% vs 65%; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.02, respectively). HCWs who reported signs of depression were less likely to altruistically accept the risks of caring for COVID-19 patients, compared to those who did not (57% vs 74%; <i>p =Ã‚Â </i>0.03). This study aimed to detect factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggested that altruistic acceptance of COVID-19 risks is higher among HCWs with positive exposure history to COVID-19 and those with less depressive symptomatology.","Msheik El Khoury, Talih, Khatib, Abi Younes, Siddik, Siddik-Sayyid","https://doi.org/10.1080/19932820.2021.1901438","20210406","COVID-19; altruism; anxiety; depression; lebanon; preparedness; risks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12617,""
"Mood Disorders and Outcomes of COVID-19 Hospitalizations","The authors sought to characterize the association between prior mood disorder diagnosis and hospital outcomes among individuals admitted with COVID-19 to six Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. A retrospective cohort was drawn from the electronic health records of two academic medical centers and four community hospitals between February 15 and May 24, 2020. Associations between history of mood disorder and in-hospital mortality and hospital discharge home were examined using regression models among any hospitalized patients with positive tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among 2,988 admitted individuals, 717 (24.0%) had a prior mood disorder diagnosis. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, and hospital site, presence of a mood disorder prior to admission was associated with greater in-hospital mortality risk beyond hospital day 12 (crude hazard ratio=2.156, 95% CI=1.540, 3.020; fully adjusted hazard ratio=1.540, 95% CI=1.054, 2.250). A mood disorder diagnosis was also associated with greater likelihood of discharge to a skilled nursing facility or other rehabilitation facility rather than home (crude odds ratio=2.035, 95% CI=1.661, 2.493; fully adjusted odds ratio=1.504, 95% CI=1.132, 1.999). Hospitalized individuals with a history of mood disorder may be at risk for greater COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and are at increased risk of need for postacute care. Further studies should investigate the mechanism by which these disorders may confer elevated risk.","Castro, Gunning, McCoy, Perlis","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20060842","20210406","Bipolar and Related Disorders; Coronavirus/COVID-19; Depressive Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12618,""
"Racial and Ethnic Differences in COVID-19 Outcomes, Stressors, Fear, and Prevention Behaviors among US Women: Web-based Cross-sectional Study","In the United States, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with persistent social and structural factors contributing to these disparities. At the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender, women of color may be disadvantaged in terms of COVID-19 outcomes due to their role as essential workers, higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, increased stress and anxiety from loss of wages and caregiving, and domestic violence. The purpose of this study was to examine racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors among adult women residing in the United States. Between May and June 2020, women were recruited into The COPE Study, a web-based cross-sectional study, using advertisements on Facebook; 491 eligible women completed a self-administered internet-based cross-sectional survey. Descriptive statistics were used to examine racial and ethnic differences (White; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Black; Hispanic, Latina or Spanish Origin; American Indian or Alaskan Native; Multiracial or some other race, ethnicity, or origin) on COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors. Among our sample of women, 16% (73/470) reported COVID-19 symptoms, 22% (18/82) were concerned about possible exposure from the people they knew who tested positive for COVID-19, and 51.4% (227/442) knew where to get tested; yet only 5.8% (27/469) had been tested. Racial/ethnic differences were observed, with racial/ethnic minority women being less likely to know where to get tested. Significant differences in race/ethnicity were observed for select stressors (food insecurity, not enough money, homeschooling children, unable to have a doctor/telemedicine appointment) and prevention behaviors (handwashing with soap, self-isolation if sick, public glove use, not leaving home for any activities). Although no racial/ethnic differences emerged for the fear of COVID-19 scale, significant racial/ethnic differences were observed for some of the individual scale items (e.g., being afraid of getting COVID-19, sleep loss and heart racing due to worrying about COVID-19). Low prevalence of COVID-19 testing and knowledge of where to get tested indicate a critical need to expand testing for women in the U.S., particularly among racial/ethnic minority women. Although overall prevalence of engagement in prevention behaviors was high, targeted education and promotion of prevention activities is warranted in communities of color, particularly with consideration for stressors and adverse mental health.","Stockman, Wood, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.2196/26296","20210405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12619,""

"Clinical and functional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing on vulnerable veterans with psychosis or recent homelessness","The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of everyone in the United States, negatively impacting social interactions, work, and living situations, and potentially exacerbating mental health issues in vulnerable individuals. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, two vulnerable groups include those with a psychotic disorder (PSY) and those who have recently experienced homelessness (recently housed Veterans, RHV). We conducted phone interviews with PSY (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 81), RHV (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 76) and control Veterans (CTL, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 74) between mid-May - mid-August 2020 (&quot;initial&quot;) and between mid-August - mid-October 2020 (&quot;follow-up&quot;). At the initial period, we also collected retrospective ratings relative to January 2020 (&quot;pre-COVID-19&quot;). We assessed clinical factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness) and community integration (e.g., social and role functioning). All groups reported worse clinical outcomes after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, PSY and RHV exhibited improvements in depression and anxiety from initial to follow up, whereas CTL continued to exhibit elevated levels. There was little change in community integration measures. Our results indicate that all groups reported increased mental health problems after the onset of the pandemic, but vulnerable Veterans were not disproportionately affected and had better mental health resilience (i.e., for depression and anxiety) as the pandemic progressed compared to CTL. This effect could be due to the availability and utilization of VA services for PSY and RHV (e.g., housing and financial support, medical and mental health services), which may have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Wynn, McCleery, Novacek, Reavis, Tsai, Green","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.051","20210405","COVID pandemic; Community integration; Homeless; Mental health; Psychosis; Veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12621,""
"No psychological vaccination: Vaccine hesitancy is associated with negative psychiatric outcomes among Israelis who received COVID-19 vaccination","The widespread COVID-19 vaccination program, issued by the Israel Government, provides a unique opportunity to examine psychiatric morbidity and vaccine attitudes among individuals who have already been vaccinated. Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs &gt; 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR &gt; 3). A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals.","Palgi, Bergman, Ben-David, Bodner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.064","20210405","COVID-19; Psychiatric morbidity; Vaccinated populations; Vaccination hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12622,""
"The Influence of COVID-19-Related Stress on Food Motivation","The COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures to reduce its transmission have increased stress. Stress is associated with alterations in eating behavior which may be partly driven by effects on food-related motivation. To investigate effects of COVID-related stress on food motivation, we recruited adults (N=429; 272 F, 157 M) to complete an online survey via Amazon MTurk in May 2020. Current COVID-related stress, retrospective pre-COVID stress, and motivation in relation to individualized preferred foods from five categories (sweet snacks, fruit, savory snacks, vegetables, and fast food) were assessed. Food motivation measures included willingness to wait, willingness to expend low effort [finger taps], willingness to expend high effort [jumping jacks], and willingness to pay for hypothetical delivery of the food item. Food motivation for each food type was assessed using a novel instrument designed for brief assessment of multiple aspects of food motivation across multiple food types. Participants were willing to pay the most for fast food followed by sweet snacks, and willing to wait longer for sweet snacks relative to other food types. While fast food and sweets also generated the most willingness to expend high and low effort, willingness to expend low effort for fruit was similar to that for fast food and sweets, and willingness to expend high effort for fruit was comparable to that for fast food. Participants were least willing to pay or expend low effort for vegetables. Higher COVID-related stress levels were associated with willingness to expend more effort and pay more for food items. Our These data collected during the pandemic demonstrate that highly processed and sweet foods have high motivating value across multiple measures of motivation, and COVID-related stress increases food motivation across food categories. Interventions to mitigate stress and target the link between stress and overeating may help to limit the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on obesity.","Smith, Jansen, Thapaliya, Aghababian, Chen, Sadler, Carnell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105233","20210405","COVID-19; appetite; food motivation; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12623,""
"Social distancing attitudes, national context, and health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a global survey","This study analyzes global health consequences of the new coronavirus disease by focusing on the roles of normative beliefs on social distancing and country-level factors, i.e., mobility estimate and globalization index. We fitted mixed effects models to examine the associations between two outcome measures, depression and self-rated health, and their multilevel determinants using a subset of Global Behaviors and Perceptions in the COVID-19 Pandemic, an online survey consisting of more than 100,000 participants from 67 nations. Results show that both personal beliefs and general beliefs significantly predict depression and poor health. There is also a contextual effect of globalization on depression. In addition, the relationship between general beliefs and depression is stronger in countries with lower rates of mobility. With respect to poor health, the effect of general beliefs similarly varies inversely with the level of globalization. Our study indicates that one's own beliefs and the perception of others' regarding social distancing, along with contextual factors (measures of mobility and globalization), critically shape mental and physical health. Subjective and objective factors should be considered, in other words, in properly understanding the differential impact of COVID-19 across the world.","Kim, Ryu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106544","20210405","COVID-19; Depression; Normative beliefs; Self-rated health; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12624,""
"Prevalence of anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare students in Jordan and its effect on their learning process: A national survey","During pandemics, including the most recent COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of university healthcare students' is expected to be affected negatively, impacting the students' learning process. The aim of this study was to assess the level of anxiety and depression of healthcare students living in Jordan, and the effect on their learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey completed by students studying a healthcare-oriented degree in a university in Jordan. Participants were recruited through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). The validated previously published Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire was used as a part of the online survey to assess students' anxiety/depression scores. Students' responses regarding their learning process during the COVID-19 was also assessed. The mean age of participants was 21.62 (SD = 4.90), with the majority being females (67.1%). The HADs' assessment revealed that 43.8% and 40.0% of participants had normal anxiety and depression scores, while 22.4% showed borderline abnormal anxiety/depression scores (33.8%). Many students (33.8%) were classified to have abnormal anxiety scores, while a smaller proportion (26.2%) was classified to have abnormal depression scores. Smoking (p = 0.022), lower family income (p = 0.039), and use of medications (p = 0.032) were positively associated with higher (worse) anxiety scores. Ranking the learning process during COVID-19 showed that 45.8% of the participants believed it was a 'good/very good/excellent' process. Anxiety and depression levels amongst university healthcare students in Jordan were found to be high when assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the learning process during the pandemic was not accepted by more than half of the students. Implementing psychological interventions for healthcare students during pandemics is strongly recommended in order to optimize students' mental health and their learning process alike.","Basheti, Mhaidat, Mhaidat","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249716","20210405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12625,""
"Emotions of COVID-19: A Study of Self-Reported Information and Emotions during the COVID-19 Pandemic using Artificial Intelligence","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted human societies across the world. Starting with a public health emergency, followed by a significant loss of human life, and the ensuing social restrictions leading to loss of employment, lack of interactions and burgeoning psychological distress. As physical distancing regulations were introduced to manage outbreaks, individuals, groups and communities engaged extensively on social media to express their thoughts and emotions. This internet-mediated communication of self-reported information encapsulates the emotional health and mental wellbeing of all individuals impacted by the pandemic. This research aims to investigate the human emotions of the COVID-19 pandemic expressed on social media over time, using an Artificial Intelligence framework. Our study explores emotion classifications, intensities, transitions, profiles and alignment to key themes and topics, across the four stages of the pandemic; declaration of a global health crisis, first lockdown, easing of restrictions, and the second lockdown. This study employs an artificial intelligence framework comprising of natural language processing, word embeddings, Markov models and Growing Self-Organizing Maps that are collectively used to investigate the social media conversations. The investigation was carried out using 73,000 public Twitter conversations from users in Australia from January to September 2020. The outcomes of this study enabled us to analyse and visualise different emotions and related concerns expressed, reflected on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, that can be used to gain insights on citizens' mental health. First, the topic analysis showed the diverse as well as common concerns people have expressed during the four stages of the pandemic. It was noted that starting from personal level concerns, the concerns expressed over social media has escalated to broader concerns over time. Second, the emotion intensity and emotion state transitions showed that 'fear' and 'sad' emotions were more prominently expressed at first, however, they transition into 'anger' and 'disgust' over time. Negative emotions except 'sad' were significantly higher (P &lt; .05) in the second lockdown showing increased frustration. The temporal emotion analysis was conducted by modelling the emotion state changes across the four stages which demonstrated how different emotions emerge and shift over time. Third, the concerns expressed by social media users were categorized into profiles, where differences could be seen between the first and second lockdown profiles. This study showed diverse emotions and concerns expressed and recorded on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the mental health of the general public. While this study establishes the use of social media to discover informed insights during a time where physical communication is impossible, the outcomes also contribute towards post-pandemic recovery, understanding psychological impact via emotion changes and potentially informing healthcare decision-making. The study exploits AI and social media to enhance our understanding of human behaviours in global emergencies, leading to improved planning and policymaking for future crises.","Adikari, Nawaratne, De Silva, Ranasinghe, Alahakoon, Alahakoon","https://doi.org/10.2196/27341","20210405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12626,""
"Screening Colonoscopy for Colon Cancer in Women during COVID-19 Pandemic","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the top three leading causes of death in both men and women. However, screening can help detect and prevent CRC. Multiple guidelines recommend CRC screening using stool-based screening and direct visualization via colonoscopy. Anatomically, women have a longer total colonic length, especially in the transverse colon, which makes it redundant; thus it is more difficult to perform complete endoscopy in women. Women also have a higher risk of developing right-sided colon cancer of the flat and depressed type, which is harder to detect than the other types. Moreover, women are less likely to undergo colonoscopy due to embarrassment, especially when the procedure is performed by male gastroenterologists, and the lack of available female gastroenterologists further complicates the problem. The current COVID-19 pandemic also decreases patients' willingness to undergo screening due to the fear of contracting the COVID-19. Delay in diagnosis leads to more advanced tumors upon detection and ultimately decreases the survival rate, especially in women, as they have lower 1-year survival rate when CRC is detected in its later stages than in men. Innovative options for CRC screening have recently emerged, including colon capsule endoscopy, which can be performed in a clinic and may reduce the need for colonoscopy. However, sex-specific CRC screening guidelines and tools are not available. The objective of this review is to identify the barriers and challenges faced when performing screening colonoscopy in women, especially during the pandemic and to encourage the development of sex-specific CRC screening.","Bestari, Joewono","https://www.google.com/search?q=Screening+Colonoscopy+for+Colon+Cancer+in+Women+during+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20210406","COVID-19; colorectal cancer; screening colonoscopy; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12627,""
"The Men's Mental Health Perspective on Adolescent Suicide in the COVID-19 Era","The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed society and introduced many new factors to consider in adolescent suicide risk assessment and prevention. One complexity that warrants consideration is the male-specific impacts of the pandemic within adolescence. A review of the relevant literature. Matters of social distancing, virtual education, and substance use may impact adolescent men in fashions that raise their suicide risk more significantly relative to adolescent women. Social distancing may impact adolescents' friendships and generate a regression back to the nuclear family; qualities of male adolescents' friendships and of masculinity suggest that these impacts may be more severe in adolescent men and may directly raise suicide risk. Virtual schooling yields educational and social setbacks; losses of team sports, male mentors, and the implications of diminished educational advancement may more adversely affect adolescent men and raise risk. Substance use has increased in the pandemic, particularly among adolescent men. There are direct associations with suicide risk as well as indirectly through increased parental conflict and punishment. As adolescent men die by suicide at significantly elevated rates relative to adolescent women, a male-specific consideration of these impacts is indicated to address adolescent suicide in our current era. Recommendations are made for integrating these considerations into updated adolescent suicide risk assessment and prevention efforts.","Rice, Sher","https://doi.org/10.1017/neu.2021.10","20210405","Adolescent; COVID-19; Individuation; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12628,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on a cohort of patients treated with clozapine","To examine the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions on a cohort of patients with severe and enduring mental illness treated with clozapine. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 63 individuals attending a clozapine clinic within the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services to determine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life, utilising Likert Scale data. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were additionally utilised to measure anxiety symptoms cross-sectionally. Anxiety symptoms were low with a median Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score of 4.0 and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score of 4.0. Likert scale measurements recorded only a modest adverse impact of COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, quality of life and occupational and social functioning.

Three months into the COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions, the impact on individuals with treatment resistant psychotic disorders attending a clozapine clinic has been modest, with preliminary evidence demonstrating minimal increases in subjective symptoms of anxiety and reduced social functioning.

"A longitudinal evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders","To examine if the Covid-19 pandemic is associated with a differential effect over time in relation to its' psychological and social impact on patients with established anxiety disorders. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an ICD-10 diagnosis of an anxiety disorder at two-time points (six-months apart) to determine the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life. No statistical difference in symptomatology was noted between the two time points in relation to anxiety symptoms as measured utilising psychometric rating scales (BAI, HARS) or utilising a Likert Scale. The greatest impact of COVID-19 at both time points related to social functioning and quality of life. Significant variability was noted for individual participants. Qualitative analysis noted social isolation, concern for the participants' future and increased difficulty managing anxiety with ongoing restrictions. No significant overall change in symptomatology or functioning over time was noted for individuals with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Variability was however demonstrated between individuals, with some individuals describing ongoing anxiety, social isolation and concern for their future. Identifying those with ongoing symptoms or distress and providing multidisciplinary support to this cohort is suggested.","Hennigan, McGovern, Plunkett, Costello, McDonald, Hallahan","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.32","20210405","Anxiety Disorders; Covid-19; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12630,""
"Impact of Covid-19 on the mental health needs of asylum seekers in Australia","This paper highlights the significant mental health vulnerabilities of people who have sought asylum in Australia and their additional adversities as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia's policies in relation to asylum seekers result in multiple human rights violations and add significantly to mental health vulnerabilities. Despite a majority being identified as refugees, people spend years in personal and administrative limbo and are denied resettlement in Australia. Social isolation and other restrictions associated with Covid-19 and recent reductions in welfare and housing support compound their difficulties. The clinical challenges in working with people impacted by these circumstances and the role of psychiatrists and the RANZCP in advocacy are identified.","Mares, Jenkins, Lutton, Newman Am","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211005445","20210405","Covid-19; asylum seekers; comorbidity; mental health; refugees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12631,""

"Psychological Consequences of the Delay in the Silent Mentor Programme During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives From Family Members of Silent Mentors","The COVID-19 pandemic has put a hold on the Silent Mentor Programme (SMP); this pause has not only caused unprecedented challenges for the delivery of medical education but has forced changes in the programme ceremony sessions. We aimed to describe the psychological impact and experiences of family members of silent mentors during the COVID-19 pandemic using qualitative interviews. Many expressed feelings of remorse and unrest about the unprecedented delay of the SMP. The delay increased negative emotions particularly among some elderly family members; however, there was no prominent negative effect on their functional health and well-being. Several participants relayed the belief that the soul cannot rest until the body receives a proper burial while some worried about the deterioration of the physical condition of the mentors. In conclusion, findings provide insights into the importance of not overlooking the mental health implications of delaying the SMP in future outbreaks or crises.","Wong, Tan, Alias, Sia, Saw","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228211000952","20210405","COVID-19; death; delay; funeral; grief","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12633,""
"Change in Health-Related Socioeconomic Risk Factors and Mental Health During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey of US Women","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> During a pandemic, women may be especially vulnerable to secondary health problems driven by its social and economic effects. We examined the relationship between changes in health-related socioeconomic risks (HRSRs) and mental health. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> A cross-sectional survey of 3,200 women aged 18-90 years was conducted in April 2020 using a quota-based sample from a national panel (88% cooperation rate). Patterns of change in HRSRs (food insecurity, housing instability, interpersonal violence, and difficulties with utilities and transportation) were described. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms among those with and without incident or worsening HRSRs. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> More than 40% of women had one or more prepandemic HRSRs. In the early pandemic phase, 49% of all women, including 29% with no prepandemic HRSRs, had experienced incident or worsening HRSRs. By April 2020, the rates of depression and anxiety were twice that of prepandemic benchmarks (29%); 17% of women had symptoms of traumatic stress. The odds of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were two to three times higher among women who reported at least one incident or worsening HRSR; this finding was similar for women with and without prepandemic HRSRs. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Increased health-related socioeconomic vulnerability among U.S. women early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was prevalent and associated with alarmingly high rates of mental health problems. Pandemic-related mental health needs are likely to be much greater than currently available resources, especially for vulnerable women.","Lindau, Makelarski, Boyd, Doyle, Haider, Kumar, Lee, Pinkerton, Tobin, Vu, Wroblewski, Lengyel","https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8879","20210405","COVID-19; disparities; health behaviors; mental health; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12634,""

"An international survey of healthcare workers use of personal protective equipment during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","Little is known regarding the specific ways personal protective equipment (PPE) has been used and reused during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of PPE use and the impact of PPE availability on the attitudes and well-being of an international population of healthcare workers. This was an online, cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers. The survey was disseminated internationally using social media, specialty society list-serves, and email augmented by snowball sampling to healthcare workers who provided direct care to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The survey was conducted between April 13 and May 1, 2020. The primary outcome was self-reported PPE use during aerosol-generating medical procedures. Other outcomes included PPE use during care for respiratory patients in general, PPE reuse, PPE decontamination, and healthcare worker impressions related to their work and the pandemic. A total of 2227 healthcare workers from 23 countries completed the survey. The N95 was the most common respirator among the 1451 respondents who performed aerosol-generating procedures (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1050, 72.3%). Overall, 1783 (80.1%) of providers reported general reuse of PPE, which was similar across US regions but less common in Canada, Italy, and Spain. The most commonly reused item of PPE was the N95 respirator, with the majority of respondents who reused PPE reporting N95 reuse (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1157, 64.9%). Of the 1050 individuals who wore an N95 mask while performing an aerosol-generating medical procedure,Ã‚Â 756 (72%) reported re-using an N95, and 344 (45.5%) reported reuse for &gt;3 days. Qualitative results identified several common themes, including (1) lack of availability of PPE, (2) fear and anxiety as a result of inadequate PPE, (3) potential exposure to family members, and (4) concerns regarding workload and pay. This international survey of healthcare workers found that N95 respirators were commonly used to care for patients with respiratory symptoms with and without aerosol-generating medical procedures. Healthcare workers reported an unprecedented need to reuse PPE that was designed for single-use, specifically the N95 respirator. The reuse of PPE increased the perceived risk for COVID-19 infection and harmed mental health.","Kea, Johnson, Lin, Lapidus, Cook, Choi, Chang, Probst, Park, Atzema, Coll-Vinent, Constantino, Pozhidayeva, Wilson, Zell, Hansen","https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12392","20210406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12636,""
"Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mood and Training in Australian Community Tennis Players","The COVID-19 outbreak has led to the implementation of strict restrictions in Australia, which have severely impacted sporting activities. Tennis is played by 6.2% of the population within the Oceania region, and is a valuable sport for maintaining social, mental, and physical health. Current literature indicates the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of Australian residents. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in training and match play due to the outbreak, and its effects on emotional well-being of Australian senior tennis players. Additionally, explore any differences between middle aged (41-60 years) and senior (61 years and over) Australian tennis players. An online survey was used to assess training and match play habits, as well as ascertain the emotional well-being of tennis players. The survey was active from 24th April 2020 until 6th June 2020. Participants were adult (41+ years) tennis players from Australia. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to check for differences in training hours and tennis matches played. Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> tests were used to assess the difference in Brief Emotional Experience Scale (BEES) scores, employment status as well as the training hours and tennis matches played between the two age groups. A Kendall's Tau B correlation test was performed to assess the associations of training, match play and demographic characteristics with BEES scores. Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed differences in BEES scores between participants of differing match play formats, tennis experience and cessation of tennis training time periods. There were 245 respondents who met our inclusion criteria. Tennis training hours along with the tennis matches played significantly decreased during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19, 85.09 and 88.48%, respectively. No significant (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) differences were observed between age groups for any of the training modality hours, nor was there any significant difference in number of tennis matches played. The participants average BEES score was 0.99 Ã‚Â± 1.27, indicating that respondents had a positive emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The emotional well-being of the senior group was significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.002) higher than the middle aged group.

"Robotic Telemedicine for Mental Health: A Multimodal Approach to Improve Human-Robot Engagement","COVID-19 has severely impacted mental health in vulnerable demographics, in particular older adults, who face unprecedented isolation. Consequences, while globally severe, are acutely pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) confronting pronounced gaps in resources and clinician accessibility. Social robots are well-recognized for their potential to support mental health, yet user compliance (i.e., trust) demands seamless affective human-robot interactions; natural 'human-like' conversations are required in simple, inexpensive, deployable platforms. We present the design, development, and pilot testing of a multimodal robotic framework fusing verbal (contextual speech) and nonverbal (facial expressions) social cues, aimed to improve engagement in human-robot interaction and ultimately facilitate mental health telemedicine during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the design optimization of a hybrid face robot, which combines digital facial expressions based on mathematical affect space mapping with static 3D facial features. We further introduce a contextual virtual assistant with integrated cloud-based AI coupled to the robot's facial representation of emotions, such that the robot adapts its emotional response to users' speech in real-time. Experiments with healthy participants demonstrate emotion recognition exceeding 90% for happy, tired, sad, angry, surprised and stern/disgusted robotic emotions. When separated, stern and disgusted are occasionally transposed (70%+ accuracy overall) but are easily distinguishable from other emotions. A qualitative user experience analysis indicates overall enthusiastic and engaging reception to human-robot multimodal interaction with the new framework. The robot has been modified to enable clinical telemedicine for cognitive engagement with older adults and people with dementia (PwD) in LMICs. The mechanically simple and low-cost social robot has been deployed in pilot tests to support older individuals and PwD at the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in Chennai, India. A procedure for deployment addressing challenges in cultural acceptance, end-user acclimatization and resource allocation is further introduced. Results indicate strong promise to stimulate human-robot psychosocial interaction through the hybrid-face robotic system. Future work is targeting deployment for telemedicine to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults and PwD in both LMICs and higher income regions.","Lima, Wairagkar, Natarajan, Vaitheswaran, Vaidyanathan","https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.618866","20210406","COVID-19; dementia; human-robot interaction; intelligent virtual assistant; low- and middle-income countries; multimodal interaction; social robots; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12638,""
"Psychological Stress Risk Factors, Concerns and Mental Health Support Among Health Care Workers in Vietnam During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak","<b>Introduction:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly affected health care workers (HCWs), including their mental health. However, there has been limited evidence on this topic in the Vietnamese context. Therefore, this study aimed to explore COVID-19-related, psychological stress risk factors among HCWs, their concerns and demands for mental health support during the pandemic period. <b>Methods:</b> We employed a cross-sectional study design with convenience sampling. An online, self-administered questionnaire was used and distributed through social media among medical and non-medical HCWs from April 22 to May 12, 2020. HCWs were categorized either as frontline or non-frontline. We measured the prevalence of psychological stress using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with psychological stress among HCWs. <b>Results:</b> Among the 774 enrolled participants, 761 (98.3%) eligible subjects were included in the analysis. Most respondents were females (58.2%), between 31 and 40 years of age (37.1%), lived in areas where confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported (61.9%), medical HCWs (59.9%) and practiced being at the frontline (46.3%). The prevalence of stress was 34.3%. We identified significant risk factors such as being frontline HCWs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.67]), perceiving worse well-being as compared to those before the COVID-19 outbreak [OR = 4.06 (95% CI: 2.15-7.67)], and experiencing chronic diseases [OR = 1.67 (95% CI: (1.01-2.77)]. Majority (73.9%) were concerned about testing positive for COVID-19 and exposing the infection to their families. Web-based psychological interventions that could provide knowledge on managing mental distress and consulting services were highly demanded among HCWs. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of psychological stress among HCWs in Vietnam during the COVID-19 pandemic was high. There were also significant risk factors associated with it. Psychological interventions involving web-based consulting services are highly recommended to provide mental health support among HCWs.","Nguyen, Nguyen, Pham, Duong, Gloria, Vo, Vo, Phung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.628341","20210406","COVID-19; healthcare worker; mental health; psychological stress; risk factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12639,""

"Siblings with coronavirus disease 2019 infection and opposite outcome-the hemodialysis's better outcome paradox: Two case reports","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus and has a unique underlying pathogenesis. Hemodialysis (HD) patients experience high risk of contamination with COVID-19 and are considered to have higher mortality rates than the general population by most but not all clinical series. We aim to highlight the peculiarities in the immune state of HD patients, who seem to have both immune-activation and immune-depression affecting their outcome in COVID-19 infection. We report the opposite clinical outcomes (nearly asymptomatic course <i>vs</i> death) of two diabetic elderly patients infected simultaneously by COVID-19, one being on chronic HD and the other with normal renal function. They were both admitted in our hospital with COVID-19 symptoms and received the same treatment by protocol. The non-HD sibling deteriorated rapidly and was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where he died despite all supportive care. The HD sibling, although considered more &quot;high-risk&quot; for adverse outcome, followed a benign course and left the hospital alive and well. These cases may shed light on aspects of the immune responses to COVID-19 between HD and non-HD patients and stimulate further research in pathophysiology and treatment of this dreadful disease.","Bacharaki, Chrysanthopoulou, Grigoropoulou, Giannakopoulos, Simitsis, Frantzeskaki, Flevari, Karagiannis, Sardeli, Kavatha, Antoniadou, Vlahakos","https://doi.org/10.5527/wjn.v10.i2.21","20210406","COVID-19; Case report; Hemodialysis; Host response; Immune-activation; Immune-depression; Siblings","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12641,""
"Bottom-up analysis of emergent properties of N-acetylcysteine as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19","N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an abundantly available antioxidant with a wide range of antidotal properties currently best studied for its use in treating acetaminophen overdose. It has a robustly established safety profile with easily tolerated side effects and presents the Food and Drug Administration's approval for use in treating acetaminophen overdose patients. It has been proven efficacious in off-label uses, such as in respiratory diseases, heart disease, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and seasonal influenza. Clinical trials have recently shown that NAC's capacity to replenish glutathione stores may significantly improve coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, especially in high risk individuals. Interestingly, individuals with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency have been shown to experience even greater benefit. The same study has concluded that NAC's ability to mitigate the impact of the cytokine storm and prevent elevation of liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, and ferritin is associated with higher success rates weaning from the ventilator and return to normal function in COVID-19 patients. Considering the background knowledge of biochemistry, current uses of NAC in clinical practice, and newly acquired evidence on its potential efficacy against COVID-19, it is worthwhile to investigate further whether this agent can be used as a treatment or adjuvant for COVID-19.","Dominari, Hathaway Iii, Kapasi, Paul, Makkar, Castaneda, Gara, Singh, Agadi, Butt, Retnakumar, Chittajallu, Taugir, Sana, Kc, Razzack, Moallem, Alvarez, Talalaev","https://doi.org/10.5501/wjv.v10.i2.34","20210406","Antioxidant; COVID-19; N-acetylcysteine; SARS-CoV-2; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12642,""
"Pain and function deteriorate in patients awaiting total joint arthroplasty that has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic","Elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures have been postponed as part of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response to avert healthcare system collapse. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures comprise the highest volume of elective procedures performed at health care facilities worldwide. To determine the demand for TJA despite the pandemic and the impact of surgery postponement on physical and mental health. We conducted a prospective cross-sectional telephonic interview-based study on patients awaiting THA and TKA at an academic institution in South Africa. The questionnaire consisted of four sections. The first section recorded baseline demographic data and medical co-morbidities, the length of time spent awaiting TJA, and the patients' desire to undergo elective surgery despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 2 and Section 3 assessed the patients' current physical and mental health, respectively, as a consequence of deferred surgical intervention. The last section established the patients' perception of the healthcare system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and necessity to postpone elective surgery. Patients received counseling and education on the current state of surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated risks. Thereafter, patients were once again asked about their desire to undergo TJA during the COVID-19 pandemic. We included 185 patients (65.95% female; mean age: 50.28 years) awaiting TJA for a mean of 26.42 Ã‚Â± 30.1 mo. Overall, 88.65% of patients wanted TJA despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients awaiting TJA for 1-3 years were 3.3-fold more likely to want surgery than those waiting &lt; 1 year (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.000). Patients with comorbidities were 8.4-fold less likely to want TJA than those with no comorbidities (<i>P</i> = 0.013). After receiving education, the patients wanting TJA decreased to 54.05%. Patients who changed their opinion after education had less insight on the increased morbidity (<i>P</i> = 0.046) and mortality (<i>P</i> = 0.001) associated with COVID-19. Despite awaiting TJA for shorter period (24.7 Ã‚Â± 20.38 mo), patients who continued to demand TJA had greater pain (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.000) and decreased function (<i>P</i> = 0.043) since TJA postponement.

"Effect of COVID-19 on air quality and pollution in different countries","COVID-19 is a pandemic that affected humans' lives and activities through the year 2020 in a way that was not witnessed in recent years. Many governments declared a complete lockdown as a try to stop the transmission of the disease. This lockdown resulted in a good recovery in environmental health, where air pollutants levels dramatically decreased. There are two relations between air pollution and COVID-19, one is before the disease spread, and the other is after. Before the disease spread, many areas had high levels of contaminants in the air due to industrial activities, transportation, and human density. These areas had the highest infection rates and death cases. This could be attributed to two reasons, the aerosol could help to spread the virus at a higher rate, and air pollutants could negatively affect peoples' lungs, which assisted the virus in attacking the patients brutally. After the disease spread, the lockdown that was applied in the major industrial countries led to a decrease in the pollutants levels and an increase in the ozone level in the air. This lockdown improved the air quality worldwide to a level that all political conferences and agreements could not reach. In this review, we are showing the impact of COVID-19 on air pollutants in different countries. This paper provides information about pollutants' influence on human and environmental health that other researchers obtained in different areas of the globe before and after the pandemic. This could give ideas about the impact of humans on the environment and the possible ways of recovering the environment's health.","Albayati, Waisi, Al-Furaiji, Kadhom, Alalwan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2021.101061","20210406","Air pollution; COVID-19; Lockdown; Nitrogen dioxide; Pandemic; Particle matter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12644,""
"COVID-19 quarantine and depression in patients with congenital heart disease","COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, especially to those with associated cardiovascular disease. An online Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) survey on consecutive congenital heart disease (CHD) patients, was carried out to determine depression during the Spanish coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine. Two-hundred forty-two out of 407 (59%) CHD patients answered the survey, 123 (51%) had mild defects, 88 (36%) moderate and 31 (13%) great defects, most of them between 18 and 24 years old and 51% were male. Patients were dichotomized to no or mild (PHQ-9 &lt; 10) and moderate to severe (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10) depressive symptoms. Thirty-four (14%) patients showed a PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10 and 10 of them (29%) were under anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment during the quarantine. During the study period, 9 (4%) patients had COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with a NYHA above 2 (P=0.025), living in houses without garden or balcony (P=0.014), needing psychological/psychiatric evaluation/medication in the previous 12 months or being under anxiolytic/antidepressant treatment during the confinement had, significantly, a PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10 (P &lt; 0.001). Being under anxiolytic/antidepressant treatment during the coronavirus pandemic [OR 3.92 (95% CI 1.05-14.66), P=0.043] and having previous psychological/psychiatric evaluation in the previous 12 months to the quarantine [OR 3.82 (95% CI 1.16-12.54), P=0.027] were the only variables that reached statistical significance, in the multivariable analysis, as predictors of a pathological PHQ-9 questionnaire (score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10). In conclusion depression was frequent during the COVID-19 quarantine among CHD patients, with only a third of them being under anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment. Needing psychological/psychiatric evaluation/treatment during the previous 12 months to the lockdown was a predictive factor for an abnormal PHQ-9 score.","MartÃƒÂ­nez-Quintana, Santana-Herrera, Vega-Acedo, PÃƒÂ©rez-Acosta, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Tugores","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+quarantine+and+depression+in+patients+with+congenital+heart+disease.","20210406","COVID-19; PHQ-9; congenital heart disease; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12645,""
"Short-Term Analysis (8 Weeks) of Social Distancing and Isolation on Mental Health and Physical Activity Behavior During COVID-19","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cities and states adopted social distancing, social isolation, or quarantine measurements to slow the transmission of the disease. Negative mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety have been associated with social distancing or social isolation. The purpose of the present study was to examine changes in psychological health and physical activity over an 8 week period under social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Ninety (73.3% female; age 32.04 Ã‚Â± 11.33) individuals participated in this study. Qualifying participants answered questions using an online survey regarding their loneliness, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, mood state, and physical activity over four time points each lasting two weeks. <b>Results:</b> Symptoms of depression and state anxiety were increased in the population when compared to nationwide statistics from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Time point 2, ~1 month into social isolation, showed the most significant effects on mental health. During this time point, 100% of the participants showed symptoms of depression. There were no significant changes in physical activity over the 8 weeks. Loneliness, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and mood state were negatively associated with participation in physical activity. Vigor and state anxiety were associated with participation in physical activity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Social isolation and social distancing practices have had a negative effect on depression, anxiety, and mood over time. It appeared that depressive symptoms and total mood disturbance was elevated during time point two. Depressive symptoms were much higher than average compared to previous epidemiological data. Physical activity amount did not change over time but was associated with poor mental health.","Peterson, Chesbro, Larson, Larson, Black","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.652086","20210406","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; exercise; loneliness; mood","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12646,""
"Meaning-Centered Coping in the Era of COVID-19: Direct and Moderating Effects on Depression, Anxiety, and Stress","The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected most of the world's population to unprecedented situations, like national lockdowns, health hazards, social isolation and economic harm. Such a scenario calls for urgent measures not only to palliate it but also, to better cope with it. According to existential positive psychology, well-being does not simply represent a lack of stress and negative emotions but highlights their importance by incorporating an adaptive relationship with them. Thus, suffering can be mitigated (and transformed into growth) by, among other factors, adopting an attitude of positive reframing, maintaining hope, existential courage, life appreciation, engagement in meaningful activities, and prosociality. The conglomerate of these elements has been recently denominated as meaning-centered coping. In this study, we evaluated the protective role of this type of coping on mental health. A sample of 12,243 participants from 30 countries across all continents completed measures of Meaning-Centered Coping Scale (MCCS), depression, stress, anxiety and stressful COVID-19 related conditions they experienced. Results indicated that meaning-centered coping was strongly associated with diminished symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, it moderated various relationships between vulnerability factors and markers of psychological distress, especially in the case of depression. These findings call for attention to meaning-centered coping approaches in the context of hardship, such as the current COVID-19 health crisis. In these difficult times, decision-makers and health organizations may integrate these approaches into their guidelines.","Eisenbeck, PÃƒÂ©rez-Escobar, Carreno","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648383","20210406","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; existential positive psychology; meaning-centered coping; positive psychology (PP1.0 and PP2.0); psychological distress; stress appraisal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12647,""
"Harnessing the Neurobiology of Resilience to Protect the Mental Well-Being of Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Healthcare workers are at a high risk of psychological morbidity in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is significant variability in the impact of this crisis on individual healthcare workers, which can be best explained through an appreciation of the construct of resilience. Broadly speaking, resilience refers to the ability to successfully adapt to stressful or traumatic events, and thus plays a key role in determining mental health outcomes following exposure to such events. A proper understanding of resilience is vital in enabling a shift from a reactive to a proactive approach for protecting and promoting the mental well-being of healthcare workers. Research in the past decade has identified six areas that provide promising leads in understanding the biological basis of individual variations in resilience. These are: (1) the key role played by the monoamines noradrenaline and serotonin, (2) the centrality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in influencing stress vulnerability and resilience, (3) the intimate links between the immune system and stress sensitivity, (4) the role of epigenetic modulation of gene expression in influencing the stress response, (5) the role played by certain neuropeptides as a natural &quot;brake&quot; mechanism in the face of stress, and (6) the neurobiological mechanisms by which environmental factors, such as exercise, diet, and social support, influence resilience to subsequent life events. Though much of this research is still in its early stages, it has already provided valuable information on which strategies - including dietary changes, lifestyle modification, environmental modification, psychosocial interventions, and even pharmacological treatments - may prove to be useful in fostering resilience in individuals and groups. This paper examines the above evidence more closely, with a specific focus on the challenges faced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides suggestions regarding how it may be translated into real-world interventions, as well as how the more tentative hypotheses advanced in this field may be tested during this critical period.","Rajkumar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.621853","20210406","coronavirus disease 2019; cortisol; epigenetics; neurobiology; neuroendocrinology; neuropeptides; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12648,""
"Impact of Divergent Thinking Training on Teenagers' Emotion and Self-Efficacy During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Currently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, young people are experiencing a decrease in self-efficacy and an increase in mental illness. Though previous studies have shown that self-efficacy and divergent thinking training are positively related, little is known about the impact of divergent thinking training on self-efficacy and emotions. Therefore, our study seeks this answer to support teenagers injured psychologically during disastrous periods. We randomly assigned 70 students to a 2 (time: pretest, post-test) Ãƒâ€” 2 (groups: divergent thinking training, controlled) mixed design. Participants in the experimental group were given a 9-day divergent thinking training with the theme of &quot;writing down 10 novel functions of the mask,&quot; while those in the control group spent 10 min each day recording what they ate. The self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, and stress of two groups were measured before and after training. Results showed that, compared to the control group, self-efficacy ceased decreasing while anxiety decreased for the experimental group. These findings confirm the positive effect of divergent thinking on teenagers. Implications and limitations are discussed.","Zuo, Wang, Qiao, Ding, Wen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.600533","20210406","COVID-19; divergent thinking; emotion; self-efficacy; teenagers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12649,""
"Relationship Between Acute Stress Responses and Quality of Life in Chinese Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Outbreak","This study aimed to determine the relationship between acute stress and quality of life and explore their influencing factors on health care workers. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted, and a sample of 525 health care workers was recruited from 15 hospitals through a convenient sampling method. Participants completed an online self-report questionnaire to assess their acute stress and quality of life. Descriptive and multiple linear regression statistics were used for this analysis. The results regarding acute stress responses varied significantly among the differences in marital status, physical activity, work status, perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, and the expected duration of the pandemic. Moreover, a younger age, lack of physical activity, being a front-line medical staff, and higher acute stress scores indicated a worse quality of life. Healthcare workers' acute stress was negatively correlated with their quality of life. Therefore, the authorities should pay special attention to health care workers' mental health and provide them with timely protection during the pandemic.","Zhang, Ji, Ji, Liu, Wang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.599136","20210406","China; acute stress; coronavirus; health care workers; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12650,""
"Mood Disorder in Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy During the COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Introduction:</b> Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is having a devastating psychological impact on patients, especially patients with cancer. This work aims to evaluate mood disorders of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy during COVID-19 in comparison with cancer patients who underwent radiation therapy in 2019. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We included all the patients undergoing radiation therapy at our department in two-time points (once a week for a month in May 2019) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (in April 2020). All the patients were asked to fulfill a validated questionnaire (STAI-Y1, State trait anxiety inventory scale), the Symptom Distress thermometer (SDT) (from 0 to 10 score), and the Beck Depression Inventory v.2 (BDI-2). We took into account the COVID-19 outbreak and also sex, age, week of radiation treatment, and disease. <b>Results:</b> We included 458 patients (220 males and 238 females), with a median age of 64 years. STAI-Y1 median score was 40 (mean 41,3, range 19-79), whereas the median score of SDT was five and BDI-2 median score was 11. STAI-Y1, SDT, and BDI-2 were significantly correlated with the COVID-19 outbreak (<i>p</i> &lt; 0,001 for all the tests), sex (<i>p</i>: 0,016 for STAI-Y1, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for SDT, <i>p</i>:0.013 for BDI-2), week of treatment (<i>p</i>: 0.012 for STAI-Y1 and <i>p</i>: 0.031 for SDT), and disease (<i>p</i>:0.015 for STAI-Y1, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for SDT and <i>p</i>:0.020 for BDI-2). <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of mood disorders in patients undergoing radiation therapy is higher than expected and even higher during the COVID-19 outbreak.

"Adjustment to a &quot;New Normal:&quot; Coping Flexibility and Mental Health Issues During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis in terms of the scope of its impact on well-being. The sudden need to navigate this &quot;new normal&quot; has compromised the mental health of many people. Coping flexibility, defined as the astute deployment of coping strategies to meet specific situational demands, is proposed as an adaptive quality during this period of upheaval. The present study investigated the associations between coping flexibility and two common mental health problems: COVID-19 anxiety and depression. The respondents were 481 Hong Kong adults (41% men; mean age = 45.09) who took part in a population-based telephone survey conducted from April to May 2020. Self-report data were assessed with the Coping Flexibility Interview Schedule, COVID-19-Related Perception and Anxiety Scale, and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Slightly more than half (52%) of the sample met the criteria for probable depression. Four types of COVID-19 anxiety were identified: anxiety over personal health, others' reactions, societal health, and economic problems. The results consistently revealed coping flexibility to be inversely associated with depression and all four types of COVID-19 anxiety. More importantly, there was a significant interaction between perceived likelihood of COVID-19 infection and coping flexibility on COVID-19 anxiety over personal health. These findings shed light on the beneficial role of coping flexibility in adjusting to the &quot;new normal&quot; amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Wang, Ebrahimi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.626197","20210406","Chinese; adaptation; coping; coronavirus disease; epidemic; psychological well-being; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12652,""
"Risk Perception, Unhealthy Behavior, and Anxiety Due to Viral Epidemic Among Healthcare Workers: The Relationships With Depressive and Insomnia Symptoms During COVID-19","We aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health problems and unhealthy behaviors among healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workers' perception regarding COVID-19 exposure in a work unit. Workers' depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-9 (SAVE-9) scale. We found that work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was associated with female sex, perception of the workplace as being dangerous, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were associated with male sex, young age, depression, and insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to closely observe the patterns of work-related stress and anxiety reactions among healthcare workers to reduce their burnout.","Lee, Lee, Hong, Shin, Chung, Park","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.615387","20210406","COVID-19; SAVE-9; hazardous work unit; healthcare worker; mental health problem; occupational stress; online survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12653,""
"Health Care Workers' Mental Health During the First Weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Switzerland-A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Objective:</b> The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses various challenges for health care workers (HCWs). This may affect their mental health, which is crucial to maintain high quality medical care during a pandemic. Existing evidence suggests that HCWs, especially women, nurses, frontline staff, and those exposed to COVID-19 patients, are at risk for anxiety and depression. However, a comprehensive overview of risk and protective factors considering their mutual influence is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed at exploring HCWs' mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland, investigating the independent effect of various demographic, work- and COVID-related factors on HCWs' mental health. <b>Methods:</b> In an exploratory, cross-sectional, nation-wide online survey, we assessed demographics, work characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and anxiety, depression, and burnout in 1,406 HCWs during the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. Network analysis was used to investigate the associations among the included variables. <b>Results:</b> Women (compared to men), nurses (compared to physicians), frontline staff (compared to non-frontline workers), and HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients (compared to non-exposed) reported more symptoms than their peers. However, these effects were all small. Perceived support by the employer independently predicted anxiety and burnout after adjustment for other risk factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our finding that some HCWs had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout underscores the importance to systematically monitor HCWs' mental health during this ongoing pandemic. Because perceived support and mental health impairments were negatively related, we encourage the implementation of supportive measures for HCWs' well-being during this crisis.","Weilenmann, Ernst, Petry, Pfaltz, Sazpinar, Gehrke, Paolercio, von KÃƒÂ¤nel, Spiller","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.594340","20210406","COVID-19; Switzerland; burnout; health care worker; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12654,""

"Well-Being Reduces COVID-19 Anxiety: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study in China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens human beings' livelihoods and mental health, which lowers their well-being and gives rise to anxiety. This study examines whether there is a causal relationship (and, if so, in which direction) between people's well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Two hundred and twenty-two participants (54.50% female, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31.53, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of subjective well-being (SWB) and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. The results showed that people's SWB and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak (T1), decline (T2), and trough stages (T3) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants' SWB at T0 (pre-pandemic stage; the base level of SWB) and T1 could significantly predict their COVID-19 anxiety at T1 and T2 respectively. However, SWB at T2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at T3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent SWB from T1 to T3.

"Rising to the Occasion of This COVID-19-Impacted Nation: Development, Implementation, and Feasibility of the Brief Assessment-Informed Skills Intervention for COVID-19 (BASIC)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy, physical health, and mental health. This pandemic, like previous viral outbreaks, has resulted in spikes in anxiety, depression, and stress. Even though millions of individuals face the physical health consequences of infection by COVID-19, even more individuals are confronted with the mental health consequences of this pandemic. This significantly increased demand for mental health services cannot be easily met by existing mental health systems, which often rely on courses of therapy to be delivered over months. Single session interventions (SSIs) may be one important approach to meeting this increased demand, as they are treatments designed to be delivered over the course of a single meeting. SSIs have been found to be effective for a range of mental health challenges, with durable effects lasting months to years later. Here, we describe an SSI designed for the COVID-19 pandemic. This Brief Assessment-informed Skills Intervention for COVID-19 (BASIC) program draws upon therapeutic skills from existing empirically supported treatments to target common presenting complaints due to this pandemic. We discuss the process of developing and implementing this intervention, as well as explore feasibility and initial clinical insights. In short, BASIC is an easy-to-adopt intervention that is designed to be effective in a single session, making it well-suited for handling the increased demand for mental health services due to COVID-19.","Hsu, Carl, DiVita, Feldman, Alban Foulser, Freihart, Madole, McNamara, Rubin, Stein, Tretyak, Smits","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.02.003","20210406","COVID-19; anxiety; single session intervention; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12658,""

Of these, a total of 1095 completed the survey, translating to a participation rate of 97.7%. Overall, 64.6%, 48.6% and 45.2%, and 34.5% of all participants self-reported symptomatic signs of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. Female gender and poor family relationships were identified as risk factors for probably PTSD, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as well. The mean scores of Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) and Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) were 66.99Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.14 and 40.76Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.31, respectively. Students suspected of a history with PTSD had considerably lower total scores for PCS-12 and MCS-12, when cross checked for similarity to those without such a history. The findings of this research suggest that evidence of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress is commonly apparent among university students during the period of the COVID-19 crisis. Prevention and intervention approaches to attenuate the psychosocial impact should be an integral component of crisis response during pandemic conditions.","Cam, Ustuner Top, Kuzlu Ayyildiz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01674-y","20210406","Coronavirus; Mental health; Quality of life; Students; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12659,""
"Public perceptions and disparities in access to telehealth orthopaedic services in the COVID-19 era","We used online crowdsourcing to explore public perceptions and attitudes towards virtual orthopaedic care, and to identify factors associated with perceived difficulty navigating telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A modified version of the validated Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire was completed by 816 individuals using crowd-sourcing methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine population characteristics associated with perceived difficulty using telehealth technology. Most respondents (85%) believed that telehealth visits would be a convenient form of healthcare delivery, and 64% would prefer them over in-person office visits. The majority (92%) agreed that telehealth would save them time, but 81% had concerns regarding the lack of physical contact during a musculoskeletal examination. More respondents would feel comfortable using telehealth for routine follow-up care (81%) compared to initial assessment visits (59%) and first postoperative appointments (60%). Roughly 1 in 15 (7%) expressed difficulty with using telehealth; these respondents were more often unmarried, lower-income, and more medically infirm, and reported greater symptoms of depression. After multivariable adjustment, lower income and poor health were retained as predictors of difficulty with navigating telehealth technology (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.027,pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.036, respectively). The majority of the public appears receptive to telehealth for orthopaedic care for both new patient visits and follow-up appointments. The finding that people with multiple chronic conditions and psychosocial needs struggle to engage with telehealth suggests that those who arguably stand to benefit the most from continued care are the ones being unintentionally left out of this digitization boom.","Puzzitiello, Moverman, Pagani, Ryan, Salzler, Jawa, Menendez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2021.02.007","20210405","COVID-19; Disparities; Telehealth; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12660,""
"Symptom Burden in Patients Treated With Palliative Radiotherapy Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Oncological care has faced several challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g. treatment delay and worsening symptoms. Patient-reported anxiety, depression and sleep quality might have changed due to these special circumstances. Therefore, we analyzed the symptom burden of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy at our center. A retrospective study was performed of 50 consecutive patients and the results were compared to those obtained in a previous pre-COVID study. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale was employed to assess the preradiotherapy symptoms. The highest mean scores were reported for pain in activity (3.2) and dry mouth (3.1). Regarding anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep, the corresponding scores were 1.5, 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. Compared to the previous study, no significant increases were found. Most items had numerically lower mean values, e.g. anxiety (1.5 vs. 2.7). Both study populations had comparable median age (70.5 vs. 70 years), gender distribution and proportion of patients with bone metastases. However, there were two significant imbalances, namely a lower proportion of patients with prostate cancer (12 vs. 30%, p=0.02) and breast cancer (0 vs. 12%, p=0.02). In patients who showed up for radiation treatment planning, the suspected increase in anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep disturbance was not demonstrable. It is not known whether or not patients with substantial worries chose to decline referral to palliative radiotherapy. Therefore, comprehensive large-scale studies of patterns of care are needed to fully understand the impact of COVID-19-related measures.","Nieder, Johnsen, Winther","https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.14964","20210404","COVID-19; cancer; palliative treatment; radiotherapy; symptom score","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12661,""

"Analyzing Indian general public's perspective on anxiety, stress and trauma during Covid-19 - A machine learning study of 840,000 tweets","Ever since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO in late March 2020, more and more people began to share their opinions online about the anxiety, stress, and trauma they suffered because of the pandemic. However, very few studies were conducted to analyze the general public's perception of what causes stress, anxiety, and trauma during COVID-19. This study focuses particularly on understanding Indian citizens. By using Machine learning techniques, particularly Natural language processing, this study focuses on understanding the attitude of Indian citizens while discussing the anxiety, stress, and trauma created because of COVID-19 and the major reasons that cause it. We used Tweets as data for this study. We have used 840,000 tweets for this study. Our sentiment analysis study revealed the interesting fact that, even while discussing about the stress, anxiety, and trauma caused by COVID-19, most of the tweets were in neutral sentiments. Death and Lockdown caused by the COVID-19 were the two most important aspects that cause stress, anxiety, and Trauma among Indian citizens. It is important for policymakers and health professionals to understand common citizen's perspectives of what causes them stress, anxiety, and trauma to formulate policies and treat the patients. Our study shows that Indian citizens use social media to share their opinions about COVID-19 and as a coping mechanism in unprecedented time.","Praveen, Ittamalla, Deepak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.03.016","20210404","Anxiety; Covid-19; Mental health; Stress; Text analysis; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12663,""
"Emergency department utilization for mental health conditions before and after the COVID-19 outbreak","The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted lives across the United States. Evidence shows that such a climate is deleterious to mental health and may increase demand for mental health services in emergency departments. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before and after the COVID-19 surge. We conducted a cross-sectional study between January-August 2019 and January-August 2020 with emergency department encounter as the sampling unit. The primary outcome was the proportion of all emergency department encounters attributed to mental health. We performed chi-square analyses to evaluate the differences between 2019 and 2020. We found that overall emergency department volume declined between 2019 and 2020, while the proportion attributable to mental health conditions increased (p &lt; 0.01). Substance abuse, anxiety, and mood disorders accounted for nearly 90% of mental health diagnoses during both periods. When stratified by sex, substance abuse was the leading mental health diagnosis for males and anxiety and substance abuse disorders combined accounted for the largest proportion for females. The emergency department is an important community resource for the identification and triage of mental health emergencies. This role is even more important during disasters and extended crises, making it imperative that emergency departments employ experienced mental health staff. This study provides a comparison of emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before the pandemic and during the spring 2020 surge and may serve as a useful guide for hospitals, health systems and communities in future planning.","Stroever, Brett, Michael, Petrini","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.03.084","20210404","COVID-19; Emergency service; Hospital; Mental health; Mental health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12664,""
"Eating behaviors and weight outcomes in bariatric surgery patients amidst COVID-19","Recent studies suggest that eating habits are an area particularly affected by the lockdown imposed by many countries to curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Individuals that received bariatric surgery may represent a particularly susceptible population to the adverse effects of lockdown for its potential impact on eating, psychological, and weight loss outcomes. This study seeks to investigate the incremental impact of COVID-19 lockdown on treatment outcomes of postbariatric patients in the risk period for weight regain. Main hospital center. This work uses data from an ongoing longitudinal study of bariatric patients assessed before surgery (T<sub>0</sub>), 1.5 years after sugery (T<sub>1</sub>), and 3 years after surgery (T<sub>2</sub>). Two independent groups were compared: the COVID-19_Group (n = 35) where T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> assessments were conducted before the pandemic started and T<sub>2</sub> assessment was conducted at the end of the mandatory COVID-19 lockdown; and the NonCOVID-19_Group (n = 66), covering patients who completed T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, and T<sub>2</sub> assessments before the epidemic began. Assessment included self-report measures for disordered eating, negative urgency, depression, anxiety, stress, and weight outcomes. General linear models for repeated measures showed that the COVID-19_Group presented significantly higher weight concern (F = 8.403, P = .005, Ã†Å¾<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .094), grazing behavior (F = 7.166, P = .009, Ã†Å¾<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .076), and negative urgency (F = 4.522, P = .036, Ã†Å¾<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .05) than the NonCOVID-19_Group.

"Finding the power within and without: How can we strengthen resilience against symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression in Australian parents during the COVID-19 pandemic?","The present study investigated the association between resilience and indicators of mental health in a large sample of Australian parents at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were from a large longitudinal cohort study of Australian parents of a child aged 0-18Ã‚Â years collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was used to measure resilience, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) measured distress (i.e., composite of stress, anxiety and depression scales). Other factors assessed included: age, gender, being born overseas, number of children, self-assessed introversion, social, educational and economic variables, family resources, positive affect and emotional regulation, external social support, and partner social support. Hierarchical regression models and a moderation analysis were used to assess the aims. Of 2110 parents, 1701 (80.6%) were female. The mean age was 38Ã‚Â years old (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7, rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19-69). High loneliness was a key contributor to distress. The level of social support received did add significantly to distress, with greater assistance associated with lower stress and anxiety (both pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .01). Partner support significantly moderated the relationship between resilience and depression; however, this relationship is of unlikely clinical significance due to its small statistical effect. Interventions targeting resilience against distress and mental health of parents at the time of pandemics should focus on reducing loneliness while working with the constraints of imposed social isolation and might include partners. Qualitative studies are needed to understand the various useful and not useful aspects of partner's support.","Mikocka-Walus, Stokes, Evans, Olive, Westrupp","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110433","20210404","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Families; Parents; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12666,""
"The impact of reduced working on mental health in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the understanding society COVID-19 study","The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an unpredictable economic crisis, currently affecting daily life for millions of workers. We examined the mental health impact of reduced working in a nationally representative sample of employees. We used Wave one (April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) COVID-19 study, with linkage to baseline mental health data from the UKHLS annual survey (January 2017- December 2018). Analysis was based on adults aged 18-65 who were employees in January/February 2020 (n=8,708), with psychological distress assessed using the GHQ-12. Logistic regression examined the mental health impact of reduced working and reasons for the reduction. Forty two percent of employees reported reduced working by April 2020, with 22% furloughed. There was no evidence of an association between reduced working per se and psychological distress in the fully adjusted model (OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.91-1.23). Those permanently laid-off (less than 1% of employees) were most vulnerable to adverse mental health effects in the early months of the pandemic (OR=3.60, 95%CI 1.55-8.37). We also found evidence of higher levels of psychological distress among those sick or self-isolating, and those with reduced working due to caring responsibilities. While the GHQ is a widely used and validated instrument in identifying potential psychiatric disorders, it is important to note that it does not represent a clinical assessment. Longitudinal examination of employment transitions and mental ill-health related to pandemic outcomes is imperative and should help inform public health responses and ongoing government policy in supporting those adversely affected.","Ferry, Bunting, Rosato, Curran, Leavey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.042","20210403","COVID-19; Economic crisis; Employment; Mental health; Redundancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12667,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health-care systems and potentially on pregnancy outcomes, but no systematic synthesis of evidence of this effect has been undertaken. We aimed to assess the collective evidence on the effects on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of the pandemic. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 8, 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports comparing maternal and perinatal mortality, maternal morbidity, pregnancy complications, and intrapartum and neonatal outcomes before and during the pandemic. We also planned to record any additional maternal and offspring outcomes identified. Studies of solely SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals, as well as case reports, studies without comparison groups, narrative or systematic literature reviews, preprints, and studies reporting on overlapping populations were excluded. Quantitative meta-analysis was done for an outcome when more than one study presented relevant data. Random-effects estimate of the pooled odds ratio (OR) of each outcome were generated with use of the Mantel-Haenszel method. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211753). The search identified 3592 citations, of which 40 studies were included. We identified significant increases in stillbirth (pooled OR 1Ã‚Â·28 [95% CI 1Ã‚Â·07-1Ã‚Â·54]; I<sup>2</sup>=63%; 12 studies, 168 295 pregnancies during and 198 993 before the pandemic) and maternal death (1Ã‚Â·37 [1Ã‚Â·22-1Ã‚Â·53; I<sup>2</sup>=0%, two studies [both from low-income and middle-income countries], 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°237Ã¢â‚¬â€°018 and 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°224Ã¢â‚¬â€°859 pregnancies) during versus before the pandemic. Preterm births before 37 weeks' gestation were not significantly changed overall (0Ã‚Â·94 [0Ã‚Â·87-1Ã‚Â·02]; I<sup>2</sup>=75%; 15 studies, 170Ã¢â‚¬â€°640 and 656Ã¢â‚¬â€°423 pregnancies) but were decreased in high-income countries (0Ã‚Â·91 [0Ã‚Â·84-0Ã‚Â·99]; I<sup>2</sup>=63%; 12 studies, 159Ã¢â‚¬â€°987 and 635Ã¢â‚¬â€°118 pregnancies), where spontaneous preterm birth was also decreased (0Ã‚Â·81 [0Ã‚Â·67-0Ã‚Â·97]; two studies, 4204 and 6818 pregnancies). Mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were higher, indicating poorer mental health, during versus before the pandemic (pooled mean difference 0Ã‚Â·42 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·02-0Ã‚Â·81; three studies, 2330 and 6517 pregnancies). Surgically managed ectopic pregnancies were increased during the pandemic (OR 5Ã‚Â·81 [2Ã‚Â·16-15Ã‚Â·6]; I<sup>2</sup>=26%; three studies, 37 and 272 pregnancies). No overall significant effects were identified for other outcomes included in the quantitative analysis: maternal gestational diabetes; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; preterm birth before 34 weeks', 32 weeks', or 28 weeks' gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth; labour induction; modes of delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery, caesarean section, or instrumental delivery); post-partum haemorrhage; neonatal death; low birthweight (&lt;2500 g); neonatal intensive care unit admission; or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min. Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression.

"Impact of COVID-19 on an established physical activity and behaviour change support programme for cancer survivors: An exploratory survey of the Macmillan Move More service for Northern Ireland","The recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has affected the delivery of routine cancer care and supportive services. The Macmillan Move More Northern Ireland (MMNI) programme provides access to physical activity and behavioural change support before, during and after cancer treatment. This evaluation details the impact of the pandemic on the MMNI participants and identifies methods to adapt service delivery. A multiple-choice and short answer online survey was sent to 730 MMNI participants, to investigate the impact of the initial, national COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, the survey examined physical activity patterns, the physical/emotional/social impact of restrictions and attitudes towards digitally supported exercise. Free text responses were analysed thematically with findings verified within the research team. 377 participants completed the survey (52% response rate). 50% of respondents had breast cancer, with 36 other diagnoses registered (82% were female). Participants reported physical activity levels decreased during restrictions, citing isolation; declining health/fitness; lack of access and motivation. The dataset trended towards women and those diagnosed with breast cancer. 71% reported the pandemic impacted their physical (n=119) and/or psychosocial (n=231) wellbeing. Many respondents were availing of digitally supported exercise, whilst half of males did not engage (46%). Finally, 80% of respondents were interested in using a MMNI smart application. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected participant physical activity levels. Supervised classes were the most popular (pre-pandemic), with enforced leisure centre closures prompting this reduction. The pandemic has negatively affected the psychosocial wellbeing (mental health) of participants, compounded by the restrictions imposed on the traditional delivery of MMNI.

"A mediating role for mental health in associations between COVID-19-related self-stigma, PTSD, quality of life, and insomnia among patients recovered from COVID-19","Patients with COVID-19 often suffer from psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and self-stigmatization that may negatively impact their quality of life and sleep. This study examined mental health as a potential mediating factor linking self-stigmatization and PTSD to quality of life and sleep. Using a cross-sectional design, 844 people who had recovered from COVID-19 were called and interviewed. Data were collected using structured scales. Structural equation modeling was applied to assess fitness of a mediation model including self-stigma and PTSD as independent factors and quality of life and insomnia as dependent variables. Mental health, COVID-19-related self-stigma, and mental quality of life were associated. Insomnia, PTSD, and COVID-19-related self-stigma displayed significant direct associations (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .334 to 0.454; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .01). A mediation model indicated satisfactory goodness of fit (CFIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.968, TLIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.950, SRMRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.071, RMSEAÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.068). Mental health as a mediator had negative relationships with COVID-19-related self-stigma, PTSD, and insomnia and positive associations with quality of life. Mental health may mediate effects of COVID-19-related self-stigma and PTSD on quality of life and insomnia. Designing programs to improve mental health among patients with COVID-19 may include efforts to reduce negative effects of PTSD and COVID-19-related self-stigma on quality of life and insomnia.","Mahmoudi, Saffari, Movahedi, Sanaeinasab, Rashidi-Jahan, Pourgholami, Poorebrahim, Barshan, Ghiami, Khoshmanesh, Potenza, Lin, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2138","20210403","COVID-19; coronavirus; quality of life; sleep disorders; stigmatization; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12672,""
"The mental health status among nurses from low-risk areas under normalized COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control in China: A cross-sectional study","This study aimed to investigate the mental health status of nurses from low-risk areas of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, its potential impact factors, and the main stressors under the normalized prevention and control in China. A mobile phone app-based survey was conducted among registered nurses in Jiangsu province via a region-stratified sampling method. The questionnaire consisted of items on the demographic characteristics of the nursing staff and their Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) along with questions for self-assessment of stressors that are associated with COVID-19. STROBE guideline was used. Among 1803 nurses who were working in the low-risk areas in Jiangsu, 22.0%, 29.8%, and 16.1% of them reported moderate to extreme levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Having 11-15Ã‚Â years of working experience and being a fixed-term contract nurse were associated with experiencing worse mental health outcomes while supporting-Wuhan working experience and having mental health preparation course training were independent factors that had beneficial impact on their psychological well-being afterward. In terms of source of pressure, a key finding of this study is that the main stressor among these nurses was the lack of patient's understanding and cooperation (71.2%) which calls for better psychosocial communication between nurses and patients. The present findings would provide information for other regions at low risk of COVID-19 and may aid the provision of support and interventions for the benefit of the psychological well-being of nurses who are exposed to life-threatening occupational risks and are more vulnerable to the pandemic than others.","Chen, Arber, Gao, Zhang, Ji, Wang, Wu, Du","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12852","20210403","COVID-19; China; anxiety; cross-sectional; depression; health status; mental health; nursing staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12673,""
"Barriers and Facilitators of Smoking Cessation among Latinos Living with HIV: Perspectives from Key Leaders of Community-Based Organizations and Clinics","The purpose of this study was to identify the perspectives from key leaders of community-based organizations (CBOs) and clinics serving people living with HIV on barriers and facilitators of smoking cessation among Latino smokers living with HIV. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in English and Spanish with 10 key leaders. Using a social ecological model, qualitative theoretical analysis was used to analyze the results. Participants identified barriers at the individual (e.g., low education level, HIV, and financial stress), interpersonal (e.g., language barriers, low social support), organizational (e.g., lack of smoking cessation resources and targeted interventions), community (e.g., HIV and mental health stigma), and policy (e.g., paperwork for insurance) level. Participants identified facilitators at the individual (e.g., high participation in trials, good medication adherence), interpersonal (e.g., no smoking in social circles), organizational (e.g., bilingual staff, culturally competent care), community (e.g., providing transportation, the coronavirus disease 2019 as an opportunity for smoking cessation), and policy level (e.g., existence of funding, comprehensive insurance programs). These results provide operational strategies to address smoking disparities among Latino smokers living with HIV. Further research is needed on how to integrate these perspectives into effective smoking cessation interventions.","Cartujano-Barrera, Lee D'Abundo, Arana-Chicas, Chock, Valera, Kamen, Cupertino","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073437","20210405","HIV; Latinos; people living with HIV; smoking; smoking cessation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12674,""
"Virtual Group Exercises and Psychological Status among Community-Dwelling Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Feasibility Study","Social isolation, magnified by the restriction of movement order during the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to negative psychosocial health impacts among community-dwelling older adults. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate recruitment rates, data collection, and group exercises conducted through virtual technology among individuals aged 60 years and over in Malaysia. Participants were recruited from the Promoting Independence in Seniors with Arthritis (PISA) pilot cohort through social media messaging. A four-week course of virtual group exercise was offered. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during the last attended follow-up of the cohort study (pre-pandemic), pre-intervention, and post-intervention. Exercise adherence was recorded using diaries with daily entries and attendance to the virtual group exercise sessions were also captured electronically daily. The outcomes of interest were changes in anxiety and depression scores from baseline to pre-intervention (pandemic-related) and post-intervention (virtual exercise related). Forty-three individuals were recruited. A significant increase in anxiety scores from baseline to pre-intervention was observed. Comparisons using repeated-measures analysis of variance between those who attendance Ã¢â€°Â¥14 and &lt;14 group exercise sessions revealed no between-within subject differences in depression scores. There was a 23% dropout rate in the post intervention survey and 60.5% of diaries were returned.

"Impact of COVID-19 on the Anxiety Perceived by Healthcare Professionals: Differences between Primary Care and Hospital Care","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an emotional impact on healthcare professionals at different levels of care, and it is important to understand the levels of anxiety of hospital personnel (HP) compared to those of primary care personnel (PCP). The objectives herein were to assess the differences in anxiety levels between these populations and to detect factors that may influence them. The anxiety levels (measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale) of the HP and PCP groups were compared using data collected from a cross-sectional study. The secondary variables included demographic and health data, confinement factors, contact with COVID-19 patients, having suffered from COVID-19, perceptions of protection, caregiver overload, threat, and satisfaction with management. We found anxiety &quot;case&quot; (35.6%) and &quot;at-risk&quot; (21%), with statistically significant differences in the group &quot;at risk&quot;, and higher scores in the PCP group. The factors associated with the perception of threat and protection were significant determinants of an increase in anxiety, with all of them showing statistically significant differences. There were greater symptoms of anxiety in the PCP group than the HP group (32% vs. 18%).

"Companion Animal Relationships and Adolescent Loneliness during COVID-19","The pandemic associated with the emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an unprecedented historical event with the potential to significantly impact adolescent loneliness. This study aimed to explore the role of companion animals and attachment to pets in the context of the pandemic. We used longitudinal quantitative survey data collected prior to and during the pandemic to assess the role of pets in predicting adolescent loneliness. Pet ownership was not a significant predictor of loneliness before the pandemic, but did predict higher levels of loneliness during COVID-19 as well as higher increases in loneliness from before to during the pandemic. Dog ownership predicted lower levels of loneliness prior to, but not during the pandemic, and dog owners were significantly more attached to their pets than non-dog pet owners. Adolescents with pets reported spending more time with their pets during the pandemic, and frequently reported pet interactions as a strategy for coping with stress. Overall, the results from this study did not support the presence of a buffering effect of companion animals on loneliness for adolescents and indicate complexity in the relationships between pet ownership, attachment, loneliness, and coping with stress. These results suggest a need for additional research further assessing how features of the relationship such as species and relationship quality might contribute to adolescent mental health outcomes.","Mueller, Richer, Callina, Charmaraman","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030885","20210405","COVID-19; adolescence; human-animal interaction; loneliness; pet ownership","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12677,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Influence on Healthcare Professionals","During the pandemic, many healthcare professionals (HCPs) are overburdened by work and stress. The aim of the study was to examine alcohol intake, sleep disorders, and depressive symptoms of HCPs during the pandemic in comparison with the pre-pandemic period. Another goal was to indicate risk factors for mental state deterioration and an increase in alcohol use. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted from 1 April to 15 May 2020. HCPs (<i>n</i> = 158) completed questionnaires that probed for symptoms during and prior to the pandemic, including the Beck depression inventory (BDI), Social Support Scale (MOS-SSS), Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB) calendar of alcohol consumption. Gender, age, education, marital status, work situation, income, participants' and relatives' COVID-19 diagnosis as correlates were analyzed. Depressive symptoms and insomnia became more severe during the pandemic among HCPs, while social support increased. The increase in depressive symptoms was even higher among women (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.05-7.36; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and was also positively correlated with work reduction (<i>p</i> = 0.02); the presence of sleep disorders was correlated with female gender. Alcohol consumption increased during the pandemic, and was correlated with both more time spent at work and income increase.

"Improving Stress Management and Sleep Hygiene in Intelligent Homes","High stress levels and sleep deprivation may cause several mental or physical health issues, such as depression, impaired memory, decreased motivation, obesity, etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented changes in our lives, generating significant stress, and worries about health, social isolation, employment, and finances. To this end, nowadays more than ever, it is crucial to deliver solutions that can help people to manage and control their stress, as well as to reduce sleep disturbances, so as to improve their health and overall quality of life. Technology, and in particular Ambient Intelligence Environments, can help towards that direction, when considering that they are able to understand the needs of their users, identify their behavior, learn their preferences, and act and react in their interest. This work presents two systems that have been designed and developed in the context of an Intelligent Home, namely CaLmi and HypnOS, which aim to assist users that struggle with stress and poor sleep quality, respectively. Both of the systems rely on real-time data collected by wearable devices, as well as contextual information retrieved from the ambient facilities of the Intelligent Home, so as to offer appropriate pervasive relaxation programs (CaLmi) or provide personalized insights regarding sleep hygiene (HypnOS) to the residents. This article will describe the design process that was followed, the functionality of both systems, the results of the user studies that were conducted for the evaluation of their end-user applications, and a discussion about future plans.","Leonidis, Korozi, Sykianaki, Tsolakou, Kouroumalis, Ioannidi, Stavridakis, Antona, Stephanidis","https://doi.org/10.3390/s21072398","20210405","ambient intelligence; contextual awareness; sleep hygiene; sleep monitoring; smart home; stress management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12680,""

The pandemic has evoked widespread collateral damage to societies and economies, and has destabilized mental health and well-being. Early in 2020, unprecedented efforts went into the development of vaccines that generate effective antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Teams developing twelve candidate vaccines, based on four platforms (messenger RNA, non-replicating viral vector, protein/virus-like particle, and inactivated virus) had initiated or announced the Phase III clinical trial stage by early November 2020, with several having received emergency use authorization in less than a year. Vaccine rollout has proceeded around the globe. Previously, we and others had proposed a target product profile (TPP) for ideal/optimal and acceptable/minimal COVID-19 vaccines.

"A Commentary about Lessons Learned: Transitioning a Therapy Dog Program Online during the COVID-19 Pandemic","In 2015, the University of Saskatchewan PAWS Your Stress Therapy Dog program partnered with St. John Ambulance for therapy dog teams to visit our campus and offer attendees love, comfort and support. We recognized at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that students, staff and faculty may require mental health support, particularly with the challenges of isolation and loneliness. In response, our team transitioned from an in-person to a novel online format at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We designed online content for participants to (1) connect with therapy dogs and experience feelings of love, comfort and support as occurred in in-person programming, and (2) learn about pandemic-specific, evidence-informed mental health knowledge. Our unique approach highlighted what dogs can teach humans about health through their own care and daily activities. From April to June 2020, we developed a website, created 28 Facebook livestreams and 60 pre-recorded videos which featured therapy dogs and handlers, and cross-promoted on various social media platforms. Over three months, first a combined process-outcome evaluation helped us determine whether our activities contributed to the program's goals. A subsequent needs assessment allowed us to elicit participant preferences for the program moving forward. This commentary reflects on these findings and our teams' collective experiences to share our key lessons learned related to program personnel needs, therapy dog handler training and support requirements, and online programming prerequisites. This combined understanding is informing our current activities with the virtual program and should be of interest to other therapy dog programs transitioning online.","Dell, Williamson, McKenzie, Carey, Cruz, Gibson, Pavelich","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030914","20210405","evaluation; isolation; mental health; social media; social support; virtual program","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12683,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ambient Air Quality in China: A Quasi-Difference-in-Difference Approach","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has provided a distinct opportunity to explore the mechanisms by which human activities affect air quality and pollution emissions.

Our study covers 367 cities from the beginning of the lockdown on 23 January 2020 until April 22, two weeks after the lockdown in the epicenter was lifted. Static and dynamic analysis of the average treatment effects on the treated is conducted for the air quality index (AQI) and six criteria pollutants. The results indicate that, first, on average, the AQI decreased by about 7%. However, it was still over the threshold set by the World Health Organization. Second, we detect heterogeneous changes in the level of different pollutants, which suggests heterogeneous impacts of the lockdown on human activities: carbon monoxide (CO) had the biggest drop, about 30%, and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) had the second-biggest drop, 20%. In contrast, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) increased by 3.74% due to the changes in the NO<sub>x</sub>/VOCs caused by the decrease in NO<sub>x</sub>, the decrease of O<sub>3</sub> titration, and particulate matter concentration. Third, air pollution levels rebounded immediately after the number of infections dropped, which indicates a swift recovery of human activities.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Brazilian Immigrant Community in the US: Results from a Qualitative Study","While an increasing body of data suggests that marginalized groups have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, little has been published about the specific impact on Brazilian immigrants in the U.S. We conducted 15 key informant interviews, one of which included two participants (<i>n</i> = 16), with representatives from social service agencies, healthcare, and faith-based organizations serving Brazilian immigrants. Key informants were asked about the community's experiences with COVID-19 testing and treatment, responses to CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines, perceptions about the virus, and the pandemic's impact on physical and mental health. Results suggest that COVID-19 has profoundly impacted Brazilian immigrants' mental and physical health. Key informants perceived that community members faced higher risk of COVID-19 infection due to overcrowded living conditions and over-representation in public-facing and informal (e.g., housecleaning) jobs. They reported barriers to COVID-19-related healthcare services including language, immigration status, and fear of deportation. Brazilian cultural norms surrounding hygiene practices, social distancing, and information distribution have shaped the community's pandemic response.

"Increased Stress Resistance and Lifespan in <i>Chaenorhabditis elegans</i> Wildtype and Knockout Mutants-Implications for Depression Treatment by Medicinal Herbs","Depression and anxiety disorders are widespread diseases, and they belong to the leading causes of disability and greatest burdens on healthcare systems worldwide. It is expected that the numbers will dramatically rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. Established medications are not sufficient to adequately treat depression and are not available for everyone. Plants from traditional medicine may be promising alternatives to treat depressive symptoms. The model organism <i>Chaenorhabditis elegans</i> was used to assess the stress reducing effects of methanol/dichlormethane extracts from plants used in traditional medicine. After initial screening for antioxidant activity, nine extracts were selected for in vivo testing in oxidative stress, heat stress, and osmotic stress assays. Additionally, anti-aging properties were evaluated in lifespan assay. The extracts from <i>Acanthopanax senticosus, Campsis grandiflora, Centella asiatica, Corydalis yanhusuo, Dan Zhi, Houttuynia cordata, Psoralea corylifolia, Valeriana officinalis</i>, and <i>Withania</i><i>somnifera</i> showed antioxidant activity of more than 15 Trolox equivalents per mg extract. The extracts significantly lowered ROS in mutants, increased resistance to heat stress and osmotic stress, and the extended lifespan of the nematodes.

An Observational Prospective Study","<i>Background and Objectives:</i> This observational prospective study aims to examine the psychological and psychopathological impact of the pandemic stress on patients with pre-existing mood, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> The study includes 386 consecutive patients recruited from 10 March to 30 June 2020 among those being treated at the Institute of Psychopathology in Rome (Italy) with an age Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years and meeting DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (35.2%), bipolar I (BD-I) (21.5%) or II (BD-II) (28.8%) disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (7.5%), panic disorder (PD) (7.0%) or social anxiety (SA). A total of 34.2% had lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders and 15.3% had alcohol/drug abuse disorders. Using a semi-structured interview, we investigated if the impact of COVID-19 stress for patients has been similar, higher or lower than that of their family and friends and, for patients with relapse/symptoms worsening, if there was a relationship between the clinical condition worsening and the pandemic stress. <i>Results:</i> Compared with that experienced by their family members and friends, the psychological impact of pandemic stress was similar in 52.1% of the sample, better in 37.1% and worse in 10.8%. In 21 patients (5.4%), the stress triggered a recurrence or worsened the symptoms. Patients with OCD had a higher rate of worsening due to pandemic stress compared to patients with MDD (<i>p</i> = 0.033), although, overall, the Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test was not significant among primary diagnoses (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 8.368; <i>p</i> = 0.057). <i>Conclusions:</i> The psychological and psychopathological consequences of COVID-19 stress in our outpatients were very modest. The continuity of care offered during the lockdown could explain the results.","Tundo, Betro', Necci","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57040304","20210405","bipolar disorder; coronavirus; major depressive disorder; obsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive disorder; panic disorder; psychological impact; social anxiety disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12688,""
"Telecommuting, Off-Time Work, and Intrusive Leadership in Workers' Well-Being","Telecommuting is a flexible form of work that has progressively spread over the last 40 years and which has been strongly encouraged by the measures to limit the COVID-19 pandemic. There is still limited evidence on the effects it has on workers' health. In this survey we invited 905 workers of companies that made a limited use of telecommuting to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate intrusive leadership of managers (IL), the request for work outside traditional hours (OFF-TAJD), workaholism (Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS)), effort/reward imbalance (ERI), happiness, and common mental issues (CMIs), anxiety and depression, assessed by the Goldberg scale (GADS). The interaction between these variables has been studied by structural equation modeling (SEM). Intrusive leadership and working after hours were significantly associated with occupational stress. Workaholism is a relevant moderator of this interaction: intrusive leadership significantly increased the stress of workaholic workers. Intrusive leadership and overtime work were associated with reduced happiness, anxiety, and depression. These results indicate the need to guarantee the right to disconnect to limit the effect of the OFF-TAJD. In addition to this, companies should implement policies to prevent intrusive leadership and workaholism.","Magnavita, Tripepi, Chiorri","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073330","20210405","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; happiness; health promotion; psychosocial stressors; smart work; work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12689,""
"COVID-19 and Health-Related Quality of Life: A Community-Based Online Survey in Hong Kong","The COVID-19 pandemic itself and related public health measurements have had substantial impacts on individual social lives and psychological and mental health, all to the detriment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There have been extensive studies investigating the mental health of people in different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have explored the impact of COVID-19 and its association with HRQoL. To fill this research gap and provide further empirical evidence, this study examined the impact of COVID-19 on Hong Kong people and evaluated its association with HRQoL. A total of 500 participants were randomly recruited to complete an online questionnaire on their concerns related to COVID-19. This entailed responding to the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF instrument. Data were collected between 24 April and 3 May 2020. Independent t-tests and multiple linear regressions were used to examine the association between the impact of COVID-19 and HRQoL. Overall, 69.6% of participants were worried about contracting COVID-19, and 41.4% frequently suspected themselves of being infected. Furthermore, 29.0% were concerned by the lack of disinfectants. All of these findings were associated with poorer HRQoL in the physical and psychological health, social relationships, and environment domains. On the other hand, 47.4% of participants were concerned that they may lose their job because of the pandemic, while 39.4% were bothered by the insufficient supply of surgical masks. These two factors were associated with poorer HRQoL in the physical and psychological health and environment domains. The adverse impact of COVID-19 on individuals is multifactorial, affecting all aspects of HRQoL. In addition to enhancing anti-epidemic efforts, it is equally important to implement public health and social welfare measures, thereby diminishing the adverse impact of COVID-19 on overall well-being.","Choi, Hui, Wan, Kwok, Tam, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063228","20210405","COVID-19; Hong Kong; bother; health status; health-related quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12690,""
"Work Engagement in Nurses during the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","In some areas of Spain, health services and professionals working in the front line against the Sars-Cov-2 virus have been widely overwhelmed at all levels. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the level of work engagement of Spanish nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was carried out. The sample consisted of 510 active nurses from all over Spain, without age exclusion, who voluntarily accepted to participate in the study. Work engagement was assessed with the 9-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) questionnaire, through an online questionnaire and non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The results showed a mean age of 45.9 years (SD = 10.7 years), most of them women (78.1%), and 58.5% were in primary care. The mean score for the UWES-9 questionnaire was 4.6 points (SD = 1.35). The categorical regression analysis performed revealed an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.75 and a significance of <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01 in the sex, type of unit, and training variables.

"Time in Nature Associated with Decreased Fatigue in UK Truck Drivers","Heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driving is recognised as a highly hazardous occupation due to the long periods of sedentary behaviour, low levels of physical activity and unhealthy food options when working. These risk factors combine with shift work and concomitant irregular sleep patterns to increase the prevalence of fatigue. Fatigue is closely linked with stress and, subsequently, poor physiological and psychological health. In parallel, a wealth of evidence has demonstrated the health and wellbeing benefits of spending time in nature. Here, we sought to examine whether spending time in nature was associated with lower levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression in HGV drivers. 89 long-distance drivers (98.9% male, mean Ã‚Â± SD age: 51.0 Ã‚Â± 9 years, body mass index: 29.8 Ã‚Â± 4.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participating in a wider health promotion programme reported time spent in nature (during and before the Covid-19 pandemic) and symptoms of occupational fatigue, depression and anxiety. After controlling for covariates, truck drivers who visited nature at least once a week exhibited 16% less chronic fatigue prior to the pandemic, and 23% less chronic fatigue and 20% less acute fatigue during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed for either anxiety or depression. As fatigue has a range of physical and mental health sequelae, we propose that increased exposure to natural settings may make a valuable contribution to interventions to promote the health and wellbeing of this underserved group.","Longman, Shaw, Varela-Mato, Sherry, Ruettger, Sayyah, Guest, Chen, Paine, King, Clemes","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063158","20210405","Covid-19; HGV driving; driving; health and wellbeing; long-distance driving; nature; self-reported fatigue; truckers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12692,""
"Differential Susceptibility to the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Working Memory, Empathy, and Perceived Stress: The Role of Cortisol and Resilience","There are important individual differences in adaptation and reactivity to stressful challenges. Being subjected to strict social confinement is a distressful psychological experience leading to reduced emotional well-being, but it is not known how it can affect the cognitive and empathic tendencies of different individuals. Cortisol, a key glucocorticoid in humans, is a strong modulator of brain function, behavior, and cognition, and the diurnal cortisol rhythm has been postulated to interact with environmental stressors to predict stress adaptation. The present study investigates in 45 young adults (21.09 years old, SD = 6.42) whether pre-pandemic diurnal cortisol indices, overall diurnal cortisol secretion (AUCg) and cortisol awakening response (CAR) can predict individuals' differential susceptibility to the impact of strict social confinement during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on working memory, empathy, and perceived stress. We observed that, following long-term home confinement, there was an increase in subjects' perceived stress and cognitive empathy scores, as well as an improvement in visuospatial working memory. Moreover, during confinement, resilient coping moderated the relationship between perceived stress scores and pre-pandemic AUCg and CAR. In addition, in mediation models, we observed a direct effect of AUCg and an indirect effect of both CAR and AUCg, on change in perceived self-efficacy. These effects were parallelly mediated by the increase in working memory span and cognitive empathy. In summary, our findings reveal the role of the diurnal pattern of cortisol in predicting the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential biomarker for the identification of at-risk groups following public health crises.","Baliyan, Cimadevilla, de Vidania, Pulopulos, Sandi, Venero","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11030348","20210405","COVID-19; anxiety; cortisol; depression; empathic concern; empathy; individual differences; perceived stress; perspective-taking; social confinement; stress; working memory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12693,""
"Community Health Workers as a Strategy to Tackle Psychosocial Suffering Due to Physical Distancing: A Randomized Controlled Trial","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many primary care professionals were overburdened and experienced difficulties reaching vulnerable patients and meeting the increased need for psychosocial support. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested whether a primary healthcare (PHC) based community health worker (CHW) intervention could tackle psychosocial suffering due to physical distancing measures in patients with limited social networks. CHWs provided 8 weeks of tailored psychosocial support to the intervention group. Control group patients received 'care as usual'. The impact on feelings of emotional support, social isolation, social participation, anxiety and fear of COVID-19 were measured longitudinally using a face-to-face survey to determine their mean change from baseline. Self-rated change in psychosocial health at 8 weeks was determined. We failed to find a significant effect of the intervention on the prespecified psychosocial health measures. However, the intervention did lead to significant improvement in self-rated change in psychosocial health. This study confirms partially the existing evidence on the effectiveness of CHW interventions as a strategy to address mental health in PHC in a COVID context. Further research is needed to elaborate the implementation of CHWs in PHC to reach vulnerable populations during and after health crises.","Vanden Bossche, Lagaert, Willems, Decat","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063097","20210405","COVID-19; community health workers; health crisis; mental health; primary healthcare; psychosocial support; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12694,""
"Fear of COVID-19 for Individuals and Family Members: Indications from the National Cross-Sectional Study of the EPICOVID19 Web-Based Survey","The study analyzed the association of the fear of contagion for oneself and for family members (FMs) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with demographic and socioeconomic status (SES) and health factors. The study was performed within the EPICOVID19 web-based Italian survey, involving adults from April-June 2020. Out of 207,341 respondents, 95.9% completed the questionnaire (60% women with an average age of 47.3 vs. 48.9 years among men). The association between fear and demographic and SES characteristics, contacts with COVID-19 cases, nasopharyngeal swab, self-perceived health, flu vaccination, chronic diseases and specific symptoms was analyzed by logistic regression model; odds ratios adjusted for sex, age, education and occupation were calculated (aORs). Fear for FMs prevailed over fear for oneself and was higher among women than men. Fear for oneself decreased with higher levels of education and in those who perceived good health. Among those vaccinated for the flu, 40.8% responded they had feelings of fear for themselves vs. 34.2% of the not vaccinated. Fear increased when diseases were declared and it was higher when associated with symptoms such as chest pain, olfactory/taste disorders, heart palpitations (aORs &gt; 1.5), lung or kidney diseases, hypertension, depression and/or anxiety. Trends in fear by region showed the highest percentage of positive responses in the southern regions.

"Engagement of Government Social Media on Facebook during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Macao","Government social media is widely used for providing updates to and engaging with the public in the COVID-19 pandemic. While Facebook is one of the popular social media used by governments, there is only a scant of research on this platform. This paper aims to understand how government social media should be used and how its engagement changes in prodromal, acute and chronic stages of the pandemic. We collected 1664 posts and 10,805 comments from the Facebook pages of the Macao government from 1 January to 31 October 2020. Using word frequency and content analysis, the results suggest that the engagement was relatively low at the beginning and then surged in the acute stage, with a decreasing trend in the chronic stage. Information about public health measures maintained their engagement in all stages, whereas the engagement of other information was dropping over time. Government social media can be used for increasing vigilance and awareness in the prodromal stage; disseminating information and increasing transparency in the acute stage; and focusing on mental health support and recovery policies in the chronic stage. Additionally, it can be a tool for controlling rumors, providing regular updates and fostering community cohesion in public health crises.","Pang, Cai, Jiang, Chan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073508","20210405","COVID-19; Facebook; Macao; communication; content analysis; engagement; government; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12696,""
"Sleep and Awakening Quality during COVID-19 Confinement: Complexity and Relevance for Health and Behavior","The aim of this study was to evaluate sleep and awakening quality (SQ and AQ) during COVID-19 in a large and diversified population in order to identify significant associations and risks in terms of demography, health and health-related behaviors, sleep variables, mental health, and attitudes. Online surveys were used for data collection, received from 5479 individuals from the general population, sleep disorder patients, and COVID-involved (medical doctors (MDs) and nurses) and COVID-affected professionals (teachers, psychologists, and dentists). SQ and AQ were worse in adults, females, and high-education subjects. Feeling worse, having economic problems, depression, anxiety, irritability, and a high Calamity Experience Check List (CECL) score during COVID were significantly associated with poor SQ and AQ. Shorter sleep duration, increased latency, poor nutrition, low physical activity, increased mobile and social network use, more negative and less positive attitudes and behaviors were associated with poor AQ. The SQ logistic regression showed gender, morbidities, CECL, and awakenings as relevant, whereas, for AQ, relevant variables further included age and physical activity. Aiming to have a high stress compliance, each individual should sleep well, have important control of their mood, practice positive behaviors while dismissing negative behaviors and attitudes, practice exercise, have adequate nutrition, and beware of technologies and dependences.","Paiva, Reis, Feliciano, Canas-SimiÃƒÂ£o, Machado, Gaspar, TomÃƒÂ©, Branquinho, Silva, Ramiro, Gaspar, Bentes, Sampaio, Pinho, Pereira, Carreiro, Moreira, Luzeiro, Pimentel, Videira, Fonseca, Bernarda, Vaz Castro, Rebocho, Almondes, CanhÃƒÂ£o, Matos","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073506","20210405","COVID-19; Calamity Experience Check List; attitudes; dependences; health; health professionals; health-related behaviors; mood; sleep patients; sleep/awakening quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12697,""
"Telemedicine in Pediatric Infectious Diseases","Telemedicine is the remote practice of medicine through the use of information and communication technologies for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases. In this narrative review, we illustrate how telemedicine technologies are increasingly integrated into pediatric infectious disease programs with the aim of facilitating access to specialist care and reducing costs. There is widespread use of telemedicine for the management of acute and chronic infectious diseases, particularly in countries in which the majority of the population lives in rural areas, far from third-level hospital centers located in large urban centers. Obviously, telemedicine is also used in developed countries, and its importance has been further increased recently given the COVID-19 pandemic. It has many advantages for patients, such as saving time, money and working hours, and reducing cancelled appointments and delays, while there are also many advantages for doctors, allowing collaborations with specialists and continuous updating. Among the disadvantages are the limitation in carrying out an objective examination, which is particularly important for children under 2 years of age, and the need for cutting-edge technology and reliable connectivity. Telemedicine increasingly represents the future and the beginning of a new healthcare system that also will redefine medical care for the treatment of infectious diseases, both acute and chronic. However, the majority of the experience has involved adults, and its validation in pediatric care, as well as its application in real-life practices, are urgently needed.","Pappalardo, Fanelli, ChinÃƒÂ©, Neglia, Gramegna, Argentiero, Esposito","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8040260","20210405","COVID-19; antimicrobial stewardship; pediatric infectious disease; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12698,""
"Online Videogames Use and Anxiety in Children during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Videogames use has constantly increased among children and adolescents, with uncertain consequences on their health.

One hundred and sixty-two children (M/F:78/84; age range: 8-10 years; average age 9.4 Ã‚Â± 0.7 years) completed the Videogame Addiction Scale for Children (VASC), the Test of Anxiety and Depression (TAD) and the Children's Anxiety Meter-State (CAM-S). Demographic variables and data on the access to electronic tools and games preferences were also collected. Overall, 96.3% of the study participants stated to have access to one or more device. They reported a low risk of videogame addiction (VASC score (mean Ã‚Â± SD): 46.7 Ã‚Â± 15.4), a moderate level of trait anxiety (TAD score (mean Ã‚Â± SD): 135 Ã‚Â± 16.8) and a low state anxiety (CAM-S score (mean Ã‚Â± SD): 2.2 Ã‚Â± 2.1). Males reported to spend more time on videogames, to perceive higher self-control and to be more influenced by reinforcement mechanisms; females described higher levels of trait anxiety.

For the first time at great scale, Chinese college students had their educational activities moved online in spring 2020. Due to this unexpected isolation and unconventional learning method, their mental health following returning to school is worth investigating. Between June 1 and June 15, 2020, a total of 8,921 returning college students' mental health status were assessed using instruments designed for psychiatric disorders, namely the 9-Item Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), 6-Item Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), Youth Self Rating Insomnia Scale (YSIS), and self-developed questionnaire. Our results showed that 8.7%, 4.2%, 10.5%, and 6.1% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia, respectively, with a total of 19.8% reporting having at least one psychiatric symptom following their return to school. Sophomore and Senior year, and presence of previous psychiatric conditions contribute to the increased occurrence of psychiatric issues. The level of impact by COVID-19 on one's daily functioning is also positively associated with poor mental health. Our findings suggested no significant increase in the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, following the first batch of students' return to school.

Nursing students have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in documented trauma, complicated grief, depression, anxiety, and secondary stress syndrome. Students entering health care in a new landscape of ongoing trauma and chronic stress exposure require a shift in the nurse educators' role and position. Extensive outcome-based synthesis of trauma-informed education in other disciplines served as basis to create a pedagogical context using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) framework for trauma-informed schools. Utilizing Watson's strategies for human caring theory in nursing education, a trauma-informed pedagogy is proposed for nurse educators. This framework for nurse educators and leaders will assist in navigating how to approach trauma-informed education in the context of higher education in nursing.

Before and after treatment, the score of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the score of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the score of self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the score of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were observed in the two groups and the clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated. After treatment, the scores of every item and the total scores in PSQI were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01).

SAS scores and SDS scores in the observation group and SAS score in the control group after treatment were all reduced as compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), and SDS score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). After treatment, in the observation group, the score of each of the symptoms of TCM, i.e. unsound sleep, irritability and hot temper, profuse sputum and sticky feeling in the mouth, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath, abdominal distention and poor appetite, as well as lassitude was reduced as compared with that before treatment successively (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), and the scores aforementioned (excepted for the unsound sleep) in the observation group were all lower than the control group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The total effective rates were 83.3% (35/42) in the observation group and 84.4% (38/45) in the control group, without statistical difference in comparison (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). The combined treatment of <i>baduanjin</i> and auricular point sticking therapy improves sleep quality, the conditions of anxiety and depression and the symptoms in TCM for patients of COVID-19 with insomnia. The therapeutic effect of this combined treatment is better than the oral administration of estazolam. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¨Â§â€žÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ§Â¡â‚¬Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥â€¦Â«Ã¦Â®ÂµÃ©â€Â¦Ã¨Ââ€Ã¥ÂË†Ã¨â‚¬Â³Ã§Â©Â´Ã¨Â´Â´Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥ÂÂ£Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¨â€°Â¾Ã¥ÂÂ¸Ã¥â€â€˜Ã¤Â»â€˜Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã§Â®â‚¬Ã§Â§Â°Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¤Â¼Â´Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã§Å“Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Â°â€ 90Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¤Â¼Â´Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã§Å“Â Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€ž(45Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨â€žÂ±Ã¨ÂÂ½3Ã¤Â¾â€¹)Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€ž(45Ã¤Â¾â€¹)Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦Â¯ÂÃ¥Â¤Â©Ã§Â»Æ’Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¥â€¦Â«Ã¦Â®ÂµÃ©â€Â¦1Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¨â‚¬Â³Ã§Â©Â´Ã¨Â´Â´Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â©Â´Ã¥Ââ€“Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã©â€”Â¨Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Å¡Â®Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å¾â€¢Ã§Â­â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å’â€°Ã¦Ââ€°3Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¦Â¬Â¡Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ§Â©Â´30 sÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¿Å¾Ã§Â»Â­Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”12 dÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥ÂÂ£Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¨â€°Â¾Ã¥ÂÂ¸Ã¥â€â€˜Ã¤Â»â€˜Ã§â€°â€¡1 mgÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¦â€”Â¥1Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¿Å¾Ã§Â»Â­Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”12 dÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Å’Â¹Ã¥â€¦Â¹Ã¥Â Â¡Ã§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¦Å’â€¡Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¯Â¼Ë†PSQIÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†SASÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†SDSÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ¥â‚¬â„¢Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Â®Å¡Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žPSQIÃ¥Ââ€žÃ©Â¡Â¹Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.01Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â½Å½Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žSASÃ£â‚¬ÂSDSÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žSASÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.01Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žSDSÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â½Å½Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.01Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Â®â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Æ’Â¦Ã¦Ëœâ€œÃ¦â‚¬â€™Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€”Â°Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥ÂÂ£Ã©Â»ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂÂ£Ã¨â€¹Â¦Ã¥ÂÂ£Ã¨â€¡Â­Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨â€¦Â¹Ã¨Æ’â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ³Ã¥Â·Â®Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¹ÂÃ¥Å â€ºÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.01Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã©â„¢Â¤Ã§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Â®â€°Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¤Â½Å½Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã§Â»â€žÃ¦â‚¬Â»Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº83.3%Ã¯Â¼Ë†35/42Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€¦Â§Ã§Â»â€žÃ¤Â¸Âº84.4%(38/45)Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â»â€žÃ©â€”Â´Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¦â€”Â Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°(<i>P</i>&gt;0.05)Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥â€¦Â«Ã¦Â®ÂµÃ©â€Â¦Ã¨Ââ€Ã¥ÂË†Ã¨â‚¬Â³Ã§Â©Â´Ã¨Â´Â´Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¥â€“â€žÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¤Â¼Â´Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã§Å“Â Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã©â€¡ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ¥â‚¬â„¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¤Â¼ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥ÂÂ£Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¨â€°Â¾Ã¥ÂÂ¸Ã¥â€â€˜Ã¤Â»â€˜Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Yang, Ma, Mei, Gong, Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.13703/j.0255-2930.20200327-0002","20210406","auricular point sticking therapy; baduanjin; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); insomnia; Acupuncture Points; Acupuncture Therapy; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Treatment Outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12703,""
"A structured program for perinatal depression and anxiety to be adopted in the emergencies","Quarantine, loss of routine and social support can negatively impact mothers who have just given birth and their babies, generating concerns and reactions of intense fear. Following the COVID-19 emergency, we described a structured program for screening and treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety as a medium for constant monitoring of perinatal risk factors and early screening, which can also be implemented in emergencies with remote intervention methods, to offer women an appropriate, timely and effective treatment. In this scenario, it is desirable that the monitoring of the psychological well-being of women in postpartum is maintained over time, with the participation of all the professional figures with whom the woman comes into contact, to intercept any forms of psychological distress related to the epidemic and that could occur even after some time.","Camoni, Brescianini, Mirabella, Calamandrei, Barbano, Cattaneo, Del Re, Michielin, Palumbo, Gigantesco","https://doi.org/10.4415/ANN_21_01_10","20210405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12704,""
"The cost of caring during recent epidemics: a rapid review of risk factors, psychological manifestations, and strategies for its treatment","During epidemics, health care workers (HCWs) are particularly exposed to the risk of secondary trauma. If not effectively addressed, the consequences of such psychological distress can progress to more severe conditions. A systematic search of several databases on the effect of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 epidemics on the mental health of HCWs was performed according to both the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the WHO Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research. The 77 reviewed studies highlighted that work organization and individual characteristics can add to mental health risk. Providing adequate training to prevent infection and prepare HCWs to handle the epidemic, strengthening team work to improve organization, and ensuring appropriate protective equipment is available can help prevent risk of psychiatric illness. Monitoring and addressing through tailored interventions the mental health consequences of pandemics in HCWs is necessary.","Ferrara, Funaro, Vacca, Kusmann, Tedeschini, Galeazzi, Scattoni, Starace","https://doi.org/10.4415/ANN_21_01_02","20210405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12705,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on REI fellowship educational experience","To assess perceived deficiencies of reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) fellow education due to changes in care secondary to COVID-19. This is a cross-sectional study performed in an academic setting. A survey was generated and administered to REI fellows and attendings practicing in programs across the United States. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify results regarding clinical volume, academic responsibilities, clinical safety, and fellowship education. The survey response rate was 23%. Eighty-four percent of respondents self-identified as fellows, and 16% identified as program directors or other REI academic instructors. Overall, the survey responses confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic tremendously affected clinical volume, with 91% of participants reporting their clinical volume decreased by at least half. Although 67% of attendings believed that the changes related to COVID-19 have or will have significantly affected the clinical skills of fellows, 66% of fellows did not believe that their clinical training had been significantly impacted. Sixty-seven percent of fellows and 78% of attendings do not believe that changes related to COVID-19 willÃ‚Â affect the ability of fellows to practice independently. Even though most attendings surveyed believed that the changes related to COVID-19 would affect the clinical skills of fellows, the cessation of clinical and research activities was short-lived, likely tempering the overall effect on clinical training. Overall, most respondents did not believe that the pandemic significantly affected fellow education.","Ghidei, Gannon, Schutt","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-021-02163-8","20210402","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Education; Fellowship; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12706,""
"Psychological distress among cancer survivors during implementation of a nationwide Movement Control Order over the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress and its associated factors among cancer survivors in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous Internet-based study was conducted between 23 April and 26 June 2020. During the study period, the country underwent phase 3 and phase 4 of the Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO). Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-assessment scale for measuring distress (total HADS score; HADS-T) with two subscales, namely, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived threat of infection was measured based on the health belief model. From a total of 631 responses received, the proportion of participants with anxiety and depression symptoms (above threshold score of 8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) was 29.0 and 20.9%, respectively. Psychological distress (HADS-T &gt; 16) was reported in 22.3% of the respondents. A total of 16.5% had combined anxiety and depression symptoms. The highest HADS-A (6.10; 95% CI 5.64-6.56), HADS-D (5.61; 95% CI 5.14-6.08), and HADS-T (11.71; 95% CI 10.84-12.58) scores were reported among respondents during phase 4 of the MCO. Partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that self-perceived health status, perceived susceptibility, and severity of COVID-19 have the greatest effect, leading to higher HADS-A, HADS-D, and HADS-T scores. Heightened psychological distress was evident in cancer survivors particularly during the enforcement of the MCO over COVID-19. Providing support to address cancer survivors' psychological and emotional needs during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential.","Wong, Lai, See, Alias, Danaee, Ting, Tok","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06182-0","20210402","COVID-19 pandemic; Cancer survivors; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12707,""
"A Novel BrainHealth Index Prototype Improved by Telehealth-Delivered Training During COVID-19","<b>Introduction:</b> Brain health is neglected in public health, receiving attention after something goes wrong. Neuroplasticity research illustrates that preventive steps strengthen the brain's component systems; however, this information is not widely known. Actionable steps are needed to scale proven population-level interventions. <b>Objectives:</b> This pilot tested two main objectives: (1) the feasibility/ease of use of an online platform to measure brain health, deliver training, and offer virtual coaching to healthy adults and (2) to develop a data driven index of brain health. Methods: 180 participants, ages 18-87, enrolled in this 12-week pilot. Participants took a BrainHealth IndexÃ¢â€žÂ¢ (BHI), a composite of assessments encompassing cognition, well-being, daily-life and social, pre-post training. Participants engaged in online training with three coaching sessions. We assessed changes in BHI, effects of training utilization and demographics, contributions of sub-domain measures to the BHI and development of a factor analytic structure of latent BrainHealth constructs. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that 75% of participants showed at least a 5-point gain on their BHI which did not depend on age, education, or gender. The contribution to these gains were from all sub-domains, including stress, anxiety and resilience, even though training focused largely on cognition. Some individuals improved due to increased resilience and decreased anxiety, whereas others improved due to increased innovation and social engagement. Larger gains depended on module utilization, especially strategy training. An exploratory factor analytic solution to the correlation matrix of online assessments identified three latent constructs. <b>Discussion/Conclusion:</b> This pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of an online platform to assess changes on a composite BrainHealth Index and efficacy in delivering training modules and coaching. We found that adults, college age to late life, were motivated to learn about their brain and engage in virtual-training with coaching to improve their brain health. This effort intends to scale up to thousands, thus the pilot data, tested by an impending imaging pilot, will be utilized in ongoing machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop a precision brain health model. This pilot is a first step in scaling evidence-based brain health protocols to reach individuals and positively affect public health globally.","Chapman, Fratantoni, Robertson, D'Esposito, Ling, Zientz, Vernon, Venza, Cook, Tate, Spence","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.641754","20210403","brain health; digital health; mental health; neuroplasticity; pandemic; personalized care; prevention; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12708,""
"Bibliotherapy as a Non-pharmaceutical Intervention to Enhance Mental Health in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review and Bioethical Meta-Analysis","<b>Background:</b> A non-pharmaceutical treatment offered as psychological support is bibliotherapy, which can be described as the process of reading, reflecting, and discussing literature to further a cognitive shift. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demands a response to prevent a peak in the prevalence of mental health problems and to avoid the collapse of mental health services, which are scarce and inaccessible due to the pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to review articles on the effectiveness of bibliotherapy on different mental health problems. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic review was conducted to examine relevant studies that assess the effectiveness of bibliotherapy in different clinical settings as a treatment capable of enhancing a sense of purpose and its surrounding values. To achieve this, a systematic review, including a bioethical meta-analysis, was performed. A variant of the PICO (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) model was used for the search strategy, and the systematic review was conducted in three databases: PubMed, Bireme, and OVID. Inclusion criteria were relevant studies that included the keywords, excluding documents with irrelevant topics, studies on subjects 15 years or younger, and in languages besides Spanish or English. Starting with 707 studies, after three rounds of different quality criteria, 13 articles were selected for analysis, including a hermeneutic analysis, which was followed by a fourth and final recovery round assessing bibliotherapy articles concerning healthcare workers. <b>Results:</b> Our findings showed that through bibliotherapy, patients developed several capacities, including the re-signification of their own activities through a new outlook of their moral horizon. There are no research road maps serving as guides to conduct research on the use of bibliotherapy to enhance mental health. Additionally, values such as autonomy and justice were closely linked with positive results in bibliotherapy. This implies that bibliotherapy has the potential to have a positive impact in different settings. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our contribution is to offer a road map that presents state-of-the-art bibliotherapy research, which will assist institutions and healthcare professionals to plan clinical and specific interventions with positive outcomes.","Monroy-Fraustro, Maldonado-Castellanos, Aboites-Molina, RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Sueiras, Altamirano-Bustamante, de Hoyos-Bermea, Altamirano-Bustamante","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.629872","20210403","bibliotherapy; bioethics; coronavirus disease 2019; litherapy; mental health; pandemic; systematic review; values","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12709,""
"Benefits of a psychoeducational happiness course on university student mental well-being both before and during a COVID-19 lockdown","We tested whether a psychoeducational course improved well-being in three cohorts. Study 1 found significantly higher mental well-being in first year undergraduates who took the course compared to a waiting-list control. Study 2 revealed that students taking the course when COVID-19 restrictions began did not experience increases in mental well-being but had significantly higher well-being than a third matched group. In Study 3, an online course increased mental well-being in University students and staff during a COVID-19 lockdown. These findings support the claim that psychoeducational courses are beneficial in both live and online formats and in times of collective uncertainty.","Hood, Jelbert, Santos","https://doi.org/10.1177/2055102921999291","20210403","mental health; mental well-being; positive psychology; students; universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12710,""
"A Moderated Mediation Effect of Stress-Related Growth and Meaning in Life in the Association Between Coronavirus Suffering and Satisfaction With Life: Development of the Stress-Related Growth Measure","As previous pandemics, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has direct and indirect effects on mental health and well-being. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether meaning in life mediated the association between coronavirus suffering and satisfaction with life and whether stress-related growth moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life on the association between these variables. Stress-Related Growth Measure (SGM) was also conducted for the purpose of this study. The participants were 402 (66% women) young adults who completed the Suffering Measure During COVID-19, Meaningful Living Measure, Satisfaction With Life Scale, and SGM. The results indicated that the SGM has adequate psychometric properties with unidimensional structure of stress-related growth in the face of adversity. Moderated mediation analysis revealed that coronavirus suffering directly influenced satisfaction with life as well as indirectly by its effect on meaning in life. Additionally, stress-related growth was found as a moderator in the relationship between coronavirus suffering-meaning in life and coronavirus suffering-satisfaction with life. These results suggest that meaning in life mitigates the effect of coronavirus suffering on satisfaction with life, and this mediating effect is moderated by stress-related growth in young adults. While meaning in life helps explain the relationship between coronavirus suffering and satisfaction with life, the stress-related growth functions as a protective factor against the adverse effect of coronavirus experiences.","YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m, Arslan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648236","20210403","coronavirus suffering; life satisfaction; meaning in life; stress-related growth measure; subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12711,""
"The Moderating Role of the Hostile-World Scenario in the Connections Between COVID-19 Worries, Loneliness, and Anxiety","The COVID-19 pandemic has had pronounced effects on individuals' psychological well-being around the world. Concerns regarding the consequences of infection, as well as the general uncertainty and governmental regulations have resulted in increased psychological distress among many populations and cultures. In this regard, research has shown that the manner by which individuals perceive such large-scale threats and appraise them significantly contributes to the psychological consequences of such events. According to the Hostile-World Scenario (HWS) model, negative engagement (NE) with such threats weakens one's competence and coping abilities, whereas positive engagement (PE) facilitates resilience and enhances psychological adjustment. Accordingly, the current study examines the moderating role of both NE and PE in the connections of two main features of the current pandemic, COVID-19-related worries and loneliness, with anxiety. Data were collected between March 16 and April 14, 2020, from 1,112 Israelis (age range 17-92, <i>M</i> = 46.90, <i>SD</i> = 16.46), who provided information regarding COVID-19 health worries, loneliness, and anxiety. A special measure assembled items pertinent to the HWS-NE and HWS-PE throughout the survey. Results demonstrated that both HWS-NE and HWS-PE were significant moderators. COVID-19-related health worries/loneliness were linked with anxiety only among individuals with high HWS-NE, and were non-significant among those with low HWS-NE. Moreover, the positive association between loneliness and anxiety was significantly mitigated by high HWS-PE.

"Albert Camus - A Psychobiographical Approach in Times of Covid-19","Albert Camus (1913-1960) stands as one of the famous pioneers in the French history of existentialism. He was a novelist, political activist, essayist and editor, as well as a journalist and playwright. Although he was described as philosopher, he often denied this ascription. Through his professional and creative expressions, Camus focused on questions of existentialism, the aspect of the human fate, and meaning in life, death and suicide. These existential questions have experienced a strong revival during the Covid-19 occurrence. This psychobiographical approach aims at understanding Albert Camus' life and work in the context of the terror management theory of Becker and Wong's 4 pillars of PP2.0 theory, namely virtue, meaning, resilience and well-being. Both theories have gained importance during the pandemic. Based on the findings of the research study, implications for future research in the context of the pandemic are given. Finally, this article provides recommendations and best practices on how to approach the Covid-19 pandemic from a terror management theory and PP2.0 perspective in the light of Albert Camus' philosophy. The contribution of this psychobiography is two-fold: first, it expands psychobiographical research on Albert Camus from absurdist and existentialist theories and thereby expands the theoretical framework of psychobiographies. Second, it aims at strengthening the importance of theoretical psychobiographical investigations and their application in real-world scenarios to address complex contemporary challenges on the basis of existentialist positive psychology theories.","Mayer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644579","20210403","Albert Camus; COVID-19; PP20; best practices; existentialist theories; psychobiography; terror management theory; transcendence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12713,""
"Mediating Effect of Personal Meaning in the Prediction of Life Satisfaction and Mental Health Problems Based on Coronavirus Suffering","<b>Research Problem:</b> The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a multi-faceted crisis worldwide. Researchers and health authorities in various parts of the world echoed the dire condition of the public's mental health. This study sought to examine the mediating effect of personal meaning on the association between coronavirus (COVID-19)-related suffering, mental health problems, and life satisfaction. Participants included 231 adults (mean age = 46.65 Ã‚Â± 13.98; 68% female) and completed measures of suffering related to COVID-19, meaning, life satisfaction, and mental health problems online. <b>Results:</b> Findings from mediation analysis showed that suffering had significant associations with personal meaning, mental health, and well-being. Furthermore, personal meaning was significantly associated with adults' mental health and well-being and mediated the negative effect of suffering on mental health and well-being. <b>Discussion:</b> Overall, results from this study indicate that personal meaning is an important promotive factor that may help to understand the negative effect of coronavirus-related suffering on mental health and well-being amid the public health crisis.","Arslan, YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m, Leung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.638379","20210403","COVID-19; mental health; personal meaning; second wave positive psychology; suffering; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12714,""
"Psychosocial Framework of Resilience: Navigating Needs and Adversities During the Pandemic, A Qualitative Exploration in the Indian Frontline Physicians","Frontline healthcare workers (HCW) have faced significant plight during the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Studies have shown their vulnerabilities to depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia. In a developing country like India, with a rising caseload, resource limitations, and stigma, the adversities faced by the physicians are more significant. We attempted to hear their &quot;voices&quot; to understand their adversities and conceptualize their resilience framework. A qualitative approach was used with a constructivist paradigm. After an initial pilot, a socio-demographically heterogeneous population of 172 physicians working in COVID-designated centers were purposively sampled from all over India. Following in-depth virtual interviews using a pre-formed semi-structured guide, the data was transcribed and translated verbatim. The interview was focused on their challenges, needs, and processes of coping and support. Charmaz's grounded theory was used for analysis supplemented by NVivo 10 software. Fear of infection, uncertainty, stigma, guilt, and social isolation emerged as the main challenges. Simultaneously, their &quot;unmet needs&quot; were flexible work policies, administrative measures for better medical protection, the sensitivity of media toward the image of HCW, effective risk communication for their health, and finally, social inclusion. Their resilience &quot;framework&quot; emerged as a process while navigating these adversities and consisted of three facets: forming a &quot;resilient identity,&quot; managing the resilience, and working through the socio-occupational distress. The role of mental well-being, social network, peer support, problem negotiation, and self-care emerged as the key coping strategies. The study findings support the global call for better psychosocial health and quality of life of the frontline HCWs. Their &quot;unheard voices&quot; explored in the study can anchor subsequent resilience-enhancing interventions and policies. Guidelines focusing on the psychological wellbeing of frontline HCWs need to be grounded in their unmet needs and lived experiences.","Banerjee, Sathyanarayana Rao, Kallivayalil, Javed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.622132","20210403","COVID-19; challenges; frontline workers; healthcare workers; physicians; psychosocial; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12715,""
"Psychological Impact of the Lockdown in Italy Due to the COVID-19 Outbreak: Are There Gender Differences?","The COVID-19 emergency has hit the whole world, finding all countries unprepared to face it. The first studies focused on the medical aspects, neglecting the psychological dimension of the populations that were forced to face changes in everyday life and in some cases to stay forcedly at home in order to reduce contagion. The present research was carried out in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. The aim was to analyze the perception of happiness, mental health, and the sense of loneliness experienced by adults during the lockdown due to the COVID pandemic. Specifically, the variables will be examined in relation to gender difference, living alone, with partner, or with partner and children. The research followed a quantitative approach using an online questionnaire. The project involved 1100 subjects from whom 721 participants (75.5% women) were extrapolated. Of them, 17.3% claimed to live alone, 39.5% with their partner, and 43.1% with their partner and children. The results show that people in general experienced a lower level of happiness and mental health and higher levels of loneliness compared to normative sample. The lockdown and pandemic condition due to COVID-19 seems to have canceled the gender differences in the perception of happiness and mental health, while it seems to have increased the perception of loneliness experienced by males compared to the pre-pandemic condition. In addition, those who lived alone perceived a greater level of loneliness than those who lived with their partner or partner and children. Unexpectedly, no significant differences emerged regarding the level of happiness and mental health between those who had direct contact with the virus and those who did not. These data should make political decision-makers reflect on the need to pay more attention to the implications that such drastic measures as a lockdown can have on people's psychological well-being.","Rania, Coppola","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.567470","20210403","COVID-19; Italy; gender differences; happiness; loneliness; mental health; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12716,""
"The Effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak on Medical Students","<b>Introduction:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has influenced the whole world, where after the first case was diagnosed in Turkey, educational activities were suspended and partial curfews were implemented. This study was conducted to assess the concerns faced by the medical students about their professional life due to the disrupted educational activities and related psychological effects. <b>Methods:</b> This is a cross-sectional survey study, conducted with self-administered questionnaires on Bezmialem Vakif University medical students, during the pandemic. The questionnaire consists of queries about demographics, environmental factors, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scales. <b>Results:</b> A total of 178 students participated in the study, with a female-to-male ratio of 5:2. Of the total respondents, 19.7% were experiencing severe anxiety, 17.4% moderate anxiety, and 37.1% mild anxiety, according to the GAD-7; and 13.5% of the respondents were experiencing severe depression, 21.9% moderate-severe depression, and 23% mild depression according to the PHQ-9. There was no statistically significant difference between the grades in terms of GAD-7 or PHQ-9 scores. Male participants were more likely to have suicidal thoughts (<i>p</i> = 0.013). According to our study, the factors with the highest influence on students were as follows: &quot;Major changes in personal life,&quot; &quot;Disruption in educational activities,&quot; and &quot;Covid-19 related anxiety of loss of relatives and contamination or infection.&quot; On average, women voted higher points for &quot;Covid-19 related anxiety of loss of relatives and contamination.&quot; <b>Conclusions:</b> We found that a significant portion of students regardless of their year in medical school were profoundly affected by the pandemic process as is shown by their anxiety and depression scores. The disruption in educational activities is one of the main factors of these effects, and we believe that these should not be ignored, as they could in the future lead to a series of problems for medical education and students alike.","Bilgi, AytaÃ…Å¸, Karatoprak, KazancÃ„Â±oÃ‡Â§lu, Ãƒâ€“zÃƒÂ§elik","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.637946","20210403","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; education; medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12717,""
"Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) Lockdown on Mental Health and Well-Being in the United Arab Emirates","United Arab Emirates (UAE) has taken unprecedented precautionary measures including complete lockdowns against COVID-19 to control its spread and ensure the well-being of individuals. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 and societal lockdown measures on the mental health of adults in the UAE. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an English and Arabic online questionnaire between May and June 2020. The psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the social and family support impact was evaluated using questions from the Perceived Support Scale (PSS). A total of 4,426 participants (3,325 females and 1,101 males) completed the questionnaire. The mean IES-R score was 28.0 Ã‚Â± 14.6, reflecting a mild stressful impact with 27.3% reporting severe psychological impact. Over 36% reported increased stress from work, home and financial matters. Also, 43-63% of the participants felt horrified, apprehensive or helpless due to COVID-19. Females, younger participants, part-timers, and college or University graduates were more likely to have a high IES-R score (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The majority of participants reported receiving increased support from family members, paying more attention to their mental health, and spending more time to rest and relax. The results of this study demonstrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among the UAE residents and highlight the need to adopt culturally appropriate interventions for the general population and vulnerable groups, such as females and younger adults.","Cheikh Ismail, Mohamad, Bataineh, Ajab, Al-Marzouqi, Jarrar, Abu Jamous, Ali, Al Sabbah, Hasan, Stojanovska, Hashim, Shaker Obaid, Saleh, Osaili, Al Dhaheri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.633230","20210403","COVID-19; United Arab Emirates; mental health; psychological impact; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12718,""
"Internet and Pornography Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Presumed Impact and What Can Be Done","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause an immense psychosocial strain worldwide. Excessive use of the internet during these psychologically trying times, fueled by physical isolation as a result of lockdowns, has translated into dysfunctional behaviors. A growing body of evidence suggests an unprecedented increase in internet use and consumption of online pornography during the pandemic, and possibly even directly caused by it. In this review, the authors report data from relevant sources to show the rise in pornography use during lockdowns in different countries worldwide. In addition to a brief overview of the neurobiology of internet addiction broadly and problematic online pornography use specifically, similarities with substance use disorders are explained. Further, the current status of the debate about defining diagnostic criteria is discussed. Finally, the review sheds light on the potential detrimental outcomes during the future post-pandemic &quot;re-adaptation,&quot; while simultaneously offering preventative and management strategies for harm reduction. The authors conclude that foresightedness with utilizing existing tools and therapies and exercising appropriate amounts of caution could go a long way in addressing the challenges that lie ahead in the post-pandemic era.","Awan, Aamir, Diwan, Ullah, Pereira-Sanchez, Ramalho, Orsolini, de Filippis, Ojeahere, Ransing, Vadsaria, Virani","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.623508","20210403","COVID-19; behavioral addictions; mental health; pornography; problematic internet use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12719,""
"Variation in Non-external and External Causes of Death in Peru in Relation to the COVID-19 Lockdown","<b>Introduction</b>: Lockdowns are designed to slow COVID-19 transmission, but they may have unanticipated relationships with other aspects of public health. Assessing the overall pattern in population health as a country implements and relaxes a lockdown is relevant, as these patterns may not necessarily be symmetric. We aimed to estimate the changing trends in cause-specific mortality in relation to the 2020 COVID-19 related lockdowns in Peru. <b>Methods</b>: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System (SINADEF), we calculated death rates per 10 million population to assess the trends in mortality rates for non-external and external causes of death (suicides, traffic accidents, and homicides). We compared these trends to 2018-2019, before, during, and after the lockdown, stratified by sex, and adjusted by Peruvian macro-region (Lima &amp; Callao (capital region), Coast, Highland, and Jungle). <b>Results</b>: Non-external deaths presented a distinctive pattern among macro-regions, with an early surge in the Jungle and a later increase in the Highland. External deaths dropped during the lockdown, however, suicides and homicides returned to previous levels in the post-lockdown period. Deaths due to traffic accidents dropped during the lockdown and returned to pre-pandemic levels by December 2020. <b>Conclusions</b>: We found a sudden drop in external causes of death, with suicides and homicides returning to previous levels after the lifting of the lockdown. Non-external deaths showed a differential pattern by macro-region. A close monitoring of these trends could help identify early spikes among these causes of death and take action to prevent a further increase in mortality indirectly affected by the pandemic.","Calderon-Anyosa, Bilal, Kaufman","https://www.google.com/search?q=Variation+in+Non-external+and+External+Causes+of+Death+in+Peru+in+Relation+to+the+COVID-19+Lockdown.","20210403","COVID-19; Homicides; Lockdown; Mortality; Suicide; Traffic accidents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12720,""

"Association between engagement in COVID-19-related work and depressive symptoms among hospital workers in a designated COVID-19 hospital in Japan: a cross-sectional study","To examine whether engagement in COVID-19-related work was associated with an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms among the staff members working in a designated medical institution for COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. A cross-sectional study. Data were obtained from a health survey conducted in July 2020 among the staff members of a designated medical institution for COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. A total of 1228 hospital workers. Engagement in COVID-19-related work (qualitatively (ie, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work or affiliation to related departments) as well as quantitatively (ie, working hours)) and job categories. Depressive symptoms. There was no significant association between depressive symptoms and engagement in work with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or affiliation to COVID-19-related departments. However, working for longer hours in March/April, when Japan witnessed a large number of infected cases, was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (Ã¢â€°Â¥11 hours/day: prevalence ratio (PR)=1.45, 95% CI=1.06 to 1.99, compared with Ã¢â€°Â¤8 hours/day). Nurses were more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms than did doctors (PR=1.70, 95% CI=1.14 to 2.54). This study suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work or having an affiliation to related departments might not be linked with a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms among Japanese hospital workers; contrarily, long working hours appeared to increase the prevalence of depressive symptoms.","Inoue, Yamamoto, Fukunaga, Hoang, Miki, Islam, Miyo, Ishii, Ishiwari, Konishi, Ohmagari, Mizoue","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049996","20210402","depression &amp; mood disorders; epidemiology; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12722,""
"Psychological and occupational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK surgeons: a qualitative investigation","The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest biopsychosocial emergency the world has faced for a century.

The aim of this study was to understand the professional and personal effects of COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons working in the UK National Health Service (NHS). Surgical departments in the NHS. Between May and July 2020, as part of an ongoing study, we asked surgeons two open-ended questions: 'What challenges are the COVID-19 crisis currently presenting to you in your work and home life?' and 'How is this stress affecting you personally?' Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data. Responses to the second question were also categorised into four groups reflecting valence: positive, neutral, mildly negative and strongly negative. A total of 141 surgeons responded to the survey and the results indicated that 85.8% reported that they were generally negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 7.8% were strongly affected in a negative way. Qualitative thematic analysis identified four key themes from responses relating to the impact of the pandemic: (1) changing and challenging work environment as a result of COVID-19; (2) challenges to professional life and development; (3) management of change and loss in the respondents' personal lives; (4) emotional and psychological impacts. The results highlighted the substantial emotional and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons' mental health, particularly in relation to fear and anxiety, loss of motivation, low mood, stress and burnout.

"Adoption, feasibility and safety of a family medicine-led remote monitoring program for patients with COVID-19: a descriptive study","Virtual care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) allows providers to monitor COVID-19-positive patients with variable trajectories while reducing the risk of transmission to others and ensuring health care capacity in acute care facilities. The objective of this descriptive analysis was to assess the initial adoption, feasibility and safety of a family medicine-led remote monitoring program, COVIDCare@Home, to manage the care of patients with COVID-19 in the community. COVIDCare@Home is a multifaceted, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program developed at an ambulatory academic centre, the Women's College Hospital in Toronto. A descriptive analysis of the first cohort of patients admitted from Apr. 8 to May 11, 2020, was conducted. Lessons from the implementation of the program are described, focusing on measure of adoption (number of visits per patient total, with a physician or with a nurse; length of follow-up), feasibility (received an oximeter or thermometer; consultation with general internal medicine, social work or mental health, pharmacy or acute ambulatory care unit) and safety (hospitalizations, mortality and emergency department visits). The COVIDCare@Home program cared for a first cohort of 97 patients (median age 41 yr, 67% female) with 415 recorded virtual visits. Patients had a median time from positive testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to first appointment of 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-4) days, with a median virtual follow-up time of 8 (IQR 5-10) days. A total of 4 (4%) had an emergency department visit, with no patients requiring hospitalization and no deaths; 16 (16%) of patients required support with mental and social health needs. A family medicine-led, team-based remote monitoring program can safely manage the care of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Virtual care approaches, particularly those that support patients with more complex health and social needs, may be an important part of ongoing health system efforts to manage subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Agarwal, Mukerji, Laur, Chandra, Pimlott, Heisey, Stovel, Goulbourne, Bhatia, Bhattacharyya, Martin","https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200174","20210402","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12725,""
"Lessons from the pandemic on the value of research infrastructure","The COVID-19 pandemic has shed a spotlight on the resilience of healthcare systems, and their ability to cope efficiently and effectively with unexpected crises. If we are to learn one economic lesson from the pandemic, arguably it is the perils of an overfocus on short-term allocative efficiency at the price of lack of capacity to deal with uncertain future challenges. In normal times, building spare capacity with 'option value' into health systems may seem inefficient, the costs potentially exceeding the benefits. Yet the fatal weakness of not doing so is that this can leave health systems highly constrained when dealing with unexpected, but ultimately inevitable, shocks-such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the pandemic has highlighted the potentially enormous option value of biomedical research infrastructure. We illustrate this with reference to COVID-19 response work supported by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. As the world deals with the fallout from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, pressure will soon come to review government expenditure, including research funding. Developing a framework to fully account for option value, and understanding the public appetite to pay for it, should allow us to be better prepared for the next emerging problem.","Roope, Candio, Kiparoglou, McShane, Duch, Clarke","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00704-2","20210402","Option value; Research funding; Research infrastructure; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12726,""

A sub-group and sensitivity analysis was done. Besides, the funnel plot and eggers publication bias test was tested. Sixteen studies that assessed 78,225 participants were included. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis for anxiety prevalence. The average prevalence of anxiety was found to be 38.12%. A sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was 33.33% in China and 47.70% in other countries (Italy, Turkey, and India). Anxiety prevalence in studies measured with the DASS-21 scale, GAD-7 scale, and other tools (SAS, HADS, and 5-point Likert scale) was 23.4%, 40.73%, and 44.47% respectively. The prevalence of anxiety in studies that assessed a sample size above 2,000 participants was 40.33%. The average prevalence of depression among included studies was 34.31% and a sub-group analysis showed that depression was higher in China (36.32%) than in other countries (28.3%). Moreover, six studies reported psychological distress and the average prevalence was 37.54%. This study revealed that anxiety, depression, and psychological distress are potential public mental health problems of the global community that suggests the need for early recognition and initiation of interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Necho, Tsehay, Birkie, Biset, Tadesse","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211003121","20210402","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; global community; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12727,""

"The Mental Health Effects of Migrant Family Separation","In June 2018, Executive Order 13841 was signed into law to end the separation of migrant families at the southern border of the United States. An injunction by a federal judge followed days later, mandating the reunification of all separated parents and children. The Office of Inspector General ultimately identified 2,737 separated children as of June 2018, noting that likely thousands of other separated children were unaccounted for. Despite reunification directives, the separation of migrant families has continued, both at our border and internationally. According to data from the US Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, motr yhsn 1,100 more youths were separated from their families at the border in the year and a half that followed these orders. Three hundred of these children were less than 5 years of age (FigureÃ‚Â 1).<sup>1</sup> Parents of 545 of the separated children are currently unable to be found by a court-appointed search committee. As the COVID-19 pandemic has infiltrated detention centers and detention conditions are being ruled as undeniably neither safe nor sanity, a 2020 federal order ensures the release of detained children from family residential centers to the community. However, government officials are releasing children without their parents, further exacerbating government-imposed separation of families at a time of heightened anxiety and uncertainty in the lives of these vulnerable children.","Shadid, Sidhu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2021.02.018","20210403","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12729,""
"Risk and protective factors of college studentsâ€™ psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: emotional stability, mental health, and household resources","Colleges and universities have increasingly worried in recent decades about college studentsâ€™ wellbeing, with the COVID-19 pandemic aggravating these concerns. Our study provides empirical evidence of changes to undergraduate emotional sentiments and psychological wellbeing from before to after the onset of the pandemic. In addition, we explore whether certain risk factors (i.e., prior mental health impairments, trait emotional stability) and protective factors (i.e., subjective socioeconomic status, parental education, household resources) predicted studentsâ€™ emotions and their intra-individual changes due to the pandemic onset. We compared experience sampling method data from 120 students from before and after the pandemic onset, examining intra-individual trajectories. There was only little change in studentsâ€™ emotions. Prior mental health impairment and trait emotional stability predicted studentsâ€™ emotions, averaged across time points, but not emotion changes. Few associations with emotions were found for subjective socioeconomic status and parental education, but study-related household-resources predicted levels and changes in emotions.","Julia Moeller et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CC-CC9-9B3","20210407","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; personality; emotions; college students; intra-individual trajectories; psychological well-being; experience sampling method; covid-19 pandemic","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","",12730,""
