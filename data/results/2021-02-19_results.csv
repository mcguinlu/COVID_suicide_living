"Social Support and Psychological Adjustment Among College Adults","Introduction: We were interested in building on previous studies showing the promotive and buffering roles of social support for emerging adults  We tested the associations of multiple domains of social support (i e , family, friends) with measures of adjustment and adversity  Methods: Across four studies, U S  college adults reported on domains of social support (family, friends, significant other), psychological adjustment (i e , life satisfaction, flourishing), and psychological adversity (i e , recent stress, depressive symptoms)  Studies 1 and 4 were cross-sectional, whereas Studies 2 and 3 involved two, monthly survey reports  Study 4 was completed against the backdrop of early COVID-19 disruptions for college adults in the Spring of 2020  Results: In each study, each domain of social support was positively correlated with measures of adjustment and negatively correlated with measures of adversity  Partial correlations indicated that support from friends was incrementally associated with nearly every outcome, whereas support from family was incrementally associated with a majority of outcomes  Multiphase studies supported unidirectional, but not bidirectional, effects from earlier adjustment onto later social support  Discussion: Overall, findings reinforce the importance of social support for young adults and highlight the distinct importance of family and friends  Findings also suggest that a lack of perceived social support may contribute to risks fitting views such as the stress generation theory among emerging adults  [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Social & Clinical Psychology is the property of Guilford Publications Inc  and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission  However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use  This abstract may be abridged  No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy  Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract  (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Wesley, Rachel, Booker, Jordan A.","https://doi.org/10.1521/jscp.2021.40.1.69","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Social & Clinical Psychology;40(1):69-95, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Social & Clinical Psychology;40(1):69-95, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10825,""

"Accelerating simulation-based inference with emerging AI hardware","Developing models of natural phenomena by capturing their underlying complex interactions is a core tenet of various scientific disciplines  These models are useful as simulators and can help in understanding the natural processes being studied  One key challenge in this pursuit has been to enable statistical inference over these models, which would allow these simulation-based models to learn from real-world observations  Recent efforts, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), show promise in performing a new kind of inference to leverage these models  While the scope of applicability of these inference algorithms is limited by the capabilities of contemporary computational hardware, they show potential of being greatly parallelized  In this work, we explore hardware accelerated simulation-based inference over probabilistic models, by combining massively parallelized ABC inference algorithm with the cutting-edge AI chip solutions that are uniquely suited for this purpose  As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate inference over a probabilistic epidemiology model used to predict the spread of COVID-19  Two hardware acceleration platforms are compared - the Tesla V100 GPU and the Graphcore Mark1 IPU  Our results show that while both of these platforms outperform multi-core CPUs, the Mk1 IPUs are 7 5x faster than the Tesla V100 GPUs for this workload  Â© 2020 International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)","Kulkarni, S.; Tsyplikhin, A.; Krell, M.

"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on lifestyle and mental health of students: A retrospective study from Karachi,Pakistan","Introduction: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries imposed lockdowns on their citizens in an attempt to contain the disease  Pakistan is one of these countries  A government mandated lockdown can have mitigating psychological effects on young adults, out of which a large fraction is made up of students  This study aims to investigate the correlations between changes in sleep pattern, perception of time, and digital media usage  Furthermore, it explores the impact of these changes on the mental health of students of different educational levels  Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire, from March 24 to April 26, 2020  The survey was targeted at students and 251 responses were obtained  It was a 5-section long questionnaire  The first section inquired about demographics of participants  Each of the other 4 section were devoted to changes in sleep pattern, perception of time flow, digital media usage and mental health status of students  Close ended questions with multiple choice responses, dichotomous, interval and 4-point Likert scales were used in the construction of the survey questionnaire  Chi square, T-tests multinomial and binary logistic regression were used as primary statistical tests  All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23 0 (IBM Corp , Armonk, NY)  Results: Out of 251 adolescents that participated in our study, the majority (70 2%) were females  The mean age of the participants was 19 40+/- 1 62 years  Two-thirds of the respondents did not have much trouble falling asleep (66 5%)  The analysis found no significant association between longer sleep periods and procrastination level (p = 0 054)  Nearly three-fourths (72 9%) of our participants felt that getting through quarantine would have been more difficult if they did not have any electronic gadgets  Of these, a majority (85 8%) had a general feeling of tiredness and lacked motivation (p = 0 023)  Additionally, a large number of students (69 7%) had reported that time is seemingly moving faster  A significant relationship between increased usage of electronic items and longer sleep periods was also noted (p = 0 005)  With respect to the level of education statistically significant values were noted for alarm use both before and after quarantine began (p = 0 021 and p = 0 004, respectively)  Further analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the median difference of time spent on social media before the outbreak (3 0+/-32 46) and time spent on social media after the outbreak (6 0+/-3 52) in a single day (p=0 000)  Conclusions: Our research has revealed that due to the lockdown imposed by the government in response to COVID-19, the sleeping patterns of the students was affected the most  Our findings show that the increase in use of social media applications led to a widespread increase in the length of sleep, worsening of sleep habits (people sleeping at much later hours than usual), and a general feeling of tiredness  A general lack of recollection regarding what day of the week it was, as well as a change in the perceived flow of time were also notable  All these findings indicate the decline in mental health of students due to the lockdown  Promoting better sleep routines, minimizing the use of digital media, and encouragement of students to take up more hobbies could collectively improve the health and mood of students in self quarantine  RÃ©sumÃ© Cette Ã©tude vise Ã  examiner la santÃ© mentale et le mode de vie des Ã©tudiants de Karachi, en surveillant les perturbations dans le rythme de leur sommeil, la perception du temps et l'utilisation des mÃ©dias numÃ©riques pendant la pandÃ©mie  Cette Ã©tude transversale a Ã©tÃ© menÃ©e au moyen d'un questionnaire en ligne, du 24 mars au 26 avril 2020  L'enquÃªte visait les Ã©tudiants et 251 rÃ©ponses ont Ã©tÃ© obtenues  Les deux tiers des rÃ©pondants n'avaient pas de difficultÃ© Ã  s'endormir (66 5 %)  PrÃ¨s des trois quarts (72 9 %) de nos participants ont estimÃ© que supporter la quarantaine aurait Ã©tÃ© plus difficile sans gadgets Ã©lectroniques  De plus, un grand nombre d'Ã©tudiants (69 7 %) ont indiquÃ© que le temps passe apparemment plus vite  En ce qui concerne le niveau d'Ã©ducation, des valeurs statistiquement significatives ont Ã©tÃ© notÃ©es pour l'utilisation de l'alarme avant et aprÃ¨s le dÃ©but de la quarantaine (p = 0 021 et p = 0 004, respectivement)  En outre, il y avait une diffÃ©rence significative dans la diffÃ©rence mÃ©diane du temps passÃ© sur les rÃ©seaux sociaux avant l'Ã©pidÃ©mie (3,0

"Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: In early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear. Objective: To determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter. Results: Of 5Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯424Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯688 inpatient encounters among 3Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯372Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯823Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯748 [52.1%] boys; 3Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯171Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯550 [42Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯110-43Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯327Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯580Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯983Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯142Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯102 [$5Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯762Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯690Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯022-$6Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯324Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯978Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pelletier, Jonathan H; Rakkar, Jaskaran; Au, Alicia K; Fuhrman, Dana; Clark, Robert S B; Horvat, Christopher M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(2): e2037227, 2021 02 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(2): e2037227, 2021 02 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10849,""
"Exposure to COVID-19-Related Information and its Association With Mental Health Problems in Thailand: Nationwide, Cross-sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on both the physical and mental health of individuals worldwide. Evidence regarding the association between mental health problems and information exposure among Thai citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the relationship between information exposure and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. METHODS: Between April 21 and May 4, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, nationwide online survey of the general population in Thailand. We categorized the duration of exposure to COVID-19-related information as follows: <1 h/day (reference group), 1-2 h/day, and &#8805;3 h/day. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Insomnia Severity Index for symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between information exposure and the risk of developing the aforementioned symptoms. An ancillary analysis using multivariable multinomial logistic regression models was also conducted to assess the possible dose-response relationship across the severity strata of mental health problems. RESULTS: Of the 4322 eligible participants, 4004 (92.6%) completed the online survey. Of them, 1481 (37.0%), 1644 (41.1%), and 879 (22.0%) participants were exposed to COVID-19-related information for less than 1 hour per day, 1 to 2 hours per day, or 3 or more hours per day, respectively. The major source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was social media (95.3%), followed by traditional media (68.7%) and family members (34.9%). Those exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day had a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.03-1.76; P=.03), anxiety (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.43-2.46; P<.001), and insomnia (adjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.17-1.97; P=.001) than people exposed to information for less than 1 hour per day. Meanwhile, people exposed to information for 1 to 2 hours per day were only at risk of developing symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69; P=.008). However, no association was found between information exposure and the risk of perceived stress. In the ancillary analysis, a dose-response relationship was observed between information exposure of 3 or more hours per day and the severity of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that social media is the main source of COVID-19-related information. Moreover, people who are exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day are more likely to develop psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Longitudinal studies investigating the long-term effects of COVID-19-related information exposure on mental health are warranted.","Mongkhon, Pajaree; Ruengorn, Chidchanok; Awiphan, Ratanaporn; Thavorn, Kednapa; Hutton, Brian; Wongpakaran, Nahathai; Wongpakaran, Tinakon; Nochaiwong, Surapon","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25363","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e25363, 2021 02 12.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e25363, 2021 02 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10850,""
"Debate: Gold standard or go for gold? The pros and cons of waiting for gold standard evidence of effectiveness for adolescent depression and self-harm interventions versus acting with the precautionary principle in current political times","There is increasing concern about the prevalence of depression and self-harm among children adolescents in many countries. Governments who commission and fund psychological interventions to address these difficulties want to know what is effective. The techniques available for synthesising gold standard evidence are increasingly sophisticated, but there are many criticisms of being completely reliant on this approach. A precautionary approach, where public policy decision-makers acknowledge that where the evidence is limited, the benefits of certain interventions are thought to outweigh the risks, including the risk of doing nothing. This later element may be particularly important in the domain of depression and self-harm, as both are associated with elevated risk of death by suicide.","Fortune, Sarah; Hetrick, Sarah","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/camh.12442","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;26(1): 83-85, 2021 Feb.; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;26(1): 83-85, 2021 Feb.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10851,""
"Psychosocial predictors of virus and social distancing fears in undergraduate students living in a US COVID-19 ""hotspot""","The COVID-19 pandemic is positioned to exact a substantial mental health toll on the global population. Heightened fears of viral contamination and fears of the negative consequences of social distancing (e.g., fears related to home confinement, fears of loneliness and isolation) might contribute to the distress caused by the pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected from undergraduates (N =Â 608) residing in a U.S. pandemic ""hotspot"" at the time of data collection (between 7 April to 9 May, 2020). Outcome variables included viral contamination fears and social distancing fears. Predictor variables included biological sex, underlying medical vulnerability, number of recent viral symptoms, presence of positive COVID-19 test in social network, anxiety, depression, stress, emotion dysregulation, intolerance of uncertainty, body vigilance, and health anxiety. Female sex, anxiety severity, intolerance of uncertainty, and health anxiety uniquely predicted fears of viral contamination. Female sex and depression severity uniquely predicted fears of social distancing. Multiple anxiety-related vulnerabilities are potential intervention targets for reducing viral contamination fears. Depression is a potential intervention target for social distancing fears. Females might be at greater risk for both types of fears.","Fedorenko, Erick J; Kibbey, Mindy M; Contrada, Richard J; Farris, Samantha G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2020.1866658","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cogn Behav Ther;: 1-17, 2021 Feb 15.; Publication details: Cogn Behav Ther;: 1-17, 2021 Feb 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10852,""

"Efficacy of a Six-Week-Long Therapist-Guided Online Therapy Versus Self-help Internet-Based Therapy for COVID-19-Induced Anxiety and Depression: Open-label, Pragmatic, Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a notable increase in psychological distress, globally. Oman is no exception to this, with several studies indicating high levels of anxiety and depression among the Omani public. There is a need for adaptive and effective interventions that aim to improve the elevated levels of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively assess the efficacy of therapist-guided online therapy with that of self-help, internet-based therapy focusing on COVID-19-induced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a 6-week-long pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety or depression among the Omani public amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman; these sessions were conducted in Arabic or English. The psychotherapists utilized cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy interventions. Participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via email containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale from the baseline to the end of the study (ie, after 6 sessions) between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to compare the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety between the two groups. RESULTS: Data from 46 participants were analyzed (intervention group n=22, control group n=24). There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between both groups. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD-7 scores (F1,43=7.307; P=.01) between the two groups after adjusting for baseline scores. GAD-7 scores of participants in the intervention group were considerably more reduced than those of participants in the control group (ÃŸ=-3.27; P=.01). Moreover, a greater reduction in mean PHQ-9 scores was observed among participants in the intervention group (F1,43=8.298; P=.006) than those in the control group (ÃŸ=-4.311; P=.006). Although the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study groups, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P=.049) than in the control group (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence to support the efficacy of online therapy for improving the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis in Oman. Therapist-guided online therapy was found to be superior to self-help, internet-based therapy; however, both therapies could be considered as viable options.

"THE DYNAMICS OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND SUICIDAL IDEATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN RUSSIA","The COVID-19 pandemic may bear serious consequences for mental health, such as the increase in psychopathological symptoms, including suicidal ideation and autoaggressive actions  In our study, depressive symptoms and suicidality were viewed as two separate characteristics, which, during the pandemic, may be influenced by different factors  Study objective: analysis of the increase in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia  Materials and methods  The materials for the study were the data from an anonymous internet survey, conducted during the period of March, 22 - June, 22, 2020  The survey included information on sociodemographic indicators and questions on how respondents assess their conditions during the pandemic;there was also a question on whether they were recently bothered by the thoughts of killing themselves  The following questionnaires were used: Symptom Check List 90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the COPE Inventory  Statistical processing was performed with the SPSS program  Results: Nine hundred eight responses were received  The analysis showed a statistically significant positive correlation between the intensity of suicidal thoughts and severity of depressive symptoms according to the SCL-90-R (Spearman's coefficient 0 45;p&lt;0 001)  The analysis found a statistically significant growth trend in depressive symptoms as the pandemic progressed (Jonckheere - Terpstra test, Std  J-T stat  = 2 51, p = 0 012), and the increase in frequency of suicidal thoughts that were expressed as 'strong' and 'very strong' in the last period of time (Fisher's Exact Test, 5 92, p = 0 046)  The correlation analysis showed that the severity of depression is higher in women and younger respondents, and statistically significantly associated with the current situation of the pandemic: it is increased with the emergence of the virus in the city of residence, with the contraction of disease among friends, with increasing fears of getting sick and die, with the presence of various somatic diseases in respondents, and the number of methods used for protection from the infection  The intensity of suicidal ideation was not associated with the risk of contagion, with the presence of ill persons among the close others, with the fears for the self and close others, but was linked to the higher proneness to risk, was higher in males and younger respondents  Along with that, the severity of depressive symptoms was linked to the higher level of search for emotional, social and instrumental help as a coping strategy  With the growing frequency of suicidal thoughts, the acceptance and planning deteriorated  Conclusions: The increase in depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts is determined by different factors  The increase in depressive symptoms is associated with various fears and mediated by non-constructive ways of coping with stress  But there are also constructive coping-strategies present, such as the search for help  The intensity of suicidal thoughts increases during the COVID-19 pandemic and is associated with the higher levels of stress, which cannot be explained by the 'objective' threat of contagion and fears for own life or lives of significant others, but is experienced as an 'indefinite' anxiety, supposedly linked to the measures to counter the pandemic, such as the restrictions on social interactions, loneliness, uncertainty  The increase in indices of depressive symptoms is linked with the orientation to another person, while the severity of suicidal ideation has no correlation with that","Medvedeva, T.

"COVID-19 Pandemic Data Predict the Stock Market","Unlike the 2007-2008 market crash, which was caused by a banking failure and led to an economic recession, the 1918 influenza pandemic triggered a worldwide financial depression  Pandemics usually affect the global economy, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception  Many stock markets have fallen over 40%, and companies are shutting down, ending contracts, and issuing voluntary and involuntary leaves for thousands of employees  These economic effects have led to an increase in unemployment rates, crime, and instability  Studying pandemics' economic effects, especially on the stock market, has not been urgent or feasible until recently  However, with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the inter-connectivity that social media provides, such research has become possible  In this paper, we propose a COVID-19-based stock market prediction system (C19-SM2) that utilizes social media  Our AI system enables economists to study how COVID-19 pandemic data influence social media and, hence, the stock market  C19-SM2 gathers COVID-19 infection and death cases reported by the authorities and social media data from a geographic area and extracts the sentiments and events that occur in that area  The information is then fed to the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest and random tree classifiers along with current stock market values  Then, the system produces a projection of the stock market's movement during the next day  We tested the system with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI)  Our system achieved a stock market prediction accuracy of 99 71%, substantially higher than the 89 93% accuracy reported in the related literature;the inclusion of COVID-19 data improved accuracy by 9 78%","Almehmadi, A.","https://doi.org/10.32604/csse.2021.015309","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Computer Systems Science and Engineering;36(3):451-460, 2021.; Publication details: Computer Systems Science and Engineering;36(3):451-460, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10856,""

"Rumination about COVID-19 and employee well-being: The role of playful work design","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted normal life and has resulted in considerable stress  One important reason for reduced well-being is rumination about COVID-19  This study used proactivity theory to propose that playful work design (i e , the process through which employees proactively create conditions within work activities that foster enjoyment and challenge) may buffer the impact of rumination on employee well-being  In May 2020, we collected data at two time points among 501 employees of a large bank cooperation  At Time 1, participants reported about rumination about COVID-19 and playful work design, and 1 week later (Time 2), they reported depressive symptoms, exhaustion, and vigor  Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that rumination about COVID-19 had a negative relationship with well-being (increased depressive symptoms and exhaustion, decreased vigor)  Designing fun was negatively related to exhaustion and positively related to vigor, whereas designing competition was positively related to vigor  As hypothesised, designing fun (not designing competition) moderated the link between rumination and well-being  Rumination was positively related to depressive symptoms and exhaustion and negatively related to vigor when participants scored lower on designing fun  These findings suggest that employees may use playful work design to deal with ruminative thoughts about COVID-19  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (French) La pandemie de COVID-19 a perturbe la vie normale et engendre un stress considerable  Les pensees recurrentes sur la COVID-19 sont l'une des principales raisons de cette reduction du mieux-etre  La presente etude recourait a la theorie de la proactivite pour postuler que le travail ludique (c -a-d , le processus grace auquel les employes creent, de facon proactive, des conditions qui favorisent le plaisir et le defi pendant les activites de travail) peut attenuer les effets nefastes des pensees recurrentes sur le mieux-etre des employes  En mai 2020, nous avons recueilli des donnees a deux periodes differentes parmi 501 employes d'une grande cooperative bancaire  A la periode 1, les participants devaient donner leur impression sur les pensees recurrentes au sujet de la COVID-19 et sur le travail ludique;une semaine plus tard (periode 2), ils devaient rapporter leurs symptomes depressifs ainsi que leurs niveaux d'epuisement et d'energie  Les resultats des analyses de regression hierarchiques ont demontre que les pensees recurrentes a propos de la COVID-19 avaient une incidence negative sur le mieux-etre (augmentation des symptomes de depression, epuisement accru, moins d'energie)  Le travail ludique etait en correlation negative avec l'epuisement et en correlation positive avec l'energie, tandis que le travail competitif etait en correlation positive avec l'energie  Comme il avait ete postule, le travail ludique (et non le travail competitif) attenuait le lien entre les pensees recurrentes et le mieux-etre  Les pensees recurrentes etaient en correlation positive avec les symptomes de depression et avec l'epuisement, et en correlation negative avec l'energie, lorsque les participants affichaient des scores inferieurs relativement au travail ludique  Ces constatations donnent a penser que les employes peuvent utiliser le travail ludique pour gerer les pensees recurrentes au sujet de la COVID-19  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Public Significance Statement: COVID-19 has disrupted daily life, and many people ruminate about the impact of the crisis  We argue and show that employees who repeatedly think about COVID-19 and the possible undesirable consequences can redesign their daily work tasks so that these tasks are more fun and employees protect their daily well-being  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Bakker, Arnold B.; van Wingerden, Jessica","https://doi.org/10.1037/cap0000262","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Canadian Psychology/Psychologie canadienne;: No Pagination Specified, 2020.; Publication details: Canadian Psychology/Psychologie canadienne;: No Pagination Specified, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10869,""

"Influence of established and subjectively perceived as well as evaluated individual characteristics on the utilization of mental health services among individuals with depressive disorders: protocol of a longitudinal study examining how to supplement the ""behavioral model of health services use"" and on need-congruent use of mental health services","BACKGROUND: Approximately one out of every three people in Germany who meets the diagnostic criteria for major depression has contact with mental health services. Therefore, according to treatment guidelines, two thirds of all individuals with depression are insufficiently treated. In the past, the subjective perspective of people who (do not) make use of mental health services has been neglected. Factors related to the use of health services are described in Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (ABM). The aim of this study is to supplement operationalizations of subjectively perceived and evaluated individual characteristics in the ABM and to evaluate whether the supplemented model can better explain mental health services use in individuals with depression than established operationalizations. METHODS: A representative telephone study with two measurement points will be conducted. In an explanatory mixed-methods design, qualitative interviews will be added to further interpret the quantitative data. A nationwide sample scoring 5 or more on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be recruited and interviewed via telephone at T0 and 12 months later (T1). Data on established and subjective characteristics as well as mental health service use will be collected. At T1, conducting a diagnostic interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview, DIA-X-12/M-CIDI) enables the recording of 12-month diagnoses according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Ideally, nÂ = 768 datasets will be available and analyzed descriptively by means of regression analysis. Up to nÂ = 32 persons who use or do not use depression-specific health services incongruent with their objective or subjective needs will be interviewed (face-to-face) to better explain their behavior. In addition, theories of non-need-based mental health service use are developed within the framework of the grounded theory-based analysis of the qualitative interviews. DISCUSSION: The study intends to contribute to the theoretical foundation of health services research and to specify the characteristics described in the ABM. Thus, after completion of the study, a further sophisticated and empirically tested model will be available to explain mental health services. The identified modifiable influencing factors are relevant for the development of strategies to increase mental health service use in line with the objective and subjective needs of individuals with depression.","Reinhold, Anna Katharina; Magaard, Julia Louise; BrÃ¼tt, Anna Levke","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03065-w","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;21(1): 68, 2021 Feb 02.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;21(1): 68, 2021 Feb 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10885,""
"An Interactive Voice Response Software to Improve the Quality of Life of People Living With HIV in Uganda: Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Following the successful scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the focus is now on ensuring good quality of life (QoL) and sustained viral suppression in people living with HIV. The access to mobile technology in the most burdened countries is increasing rapidly, and therefore, mobile health (mHealth) technologies could be leveraged to improve QoL in people living with HIV. However, data on the impact of mHealth tools on the QoL in people living with HIV are limited to the evaluation of SMS text messaging; these are infeasible in high-illiteracy settings. OBJECTIVE: The primary and secondary outcomes were to determine the impact of interactive voice response (IVR) technology on Medical Outcomes Study HIV QoL scores and viral suppression at 12 months, respectively. METHODS: Within the Call for Life study, ART-experienced and ART-naÃ¯ve people living with HIV commencing ART were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the control (no IVR support) or intervention arm (daily adherence and pre-appointment reminders, health information tips, and option to report symptoms). The software evaluated was Call for Life Uganda, an IVR technology that is based on the Mobile Technology for Community Health open-source software. Eligibility criteria for participation included access to a phone, fluency in local languages, and provision of consent. The differences in differences (DIDs) were computed, adjusting for baseline HIV RNA and CD4. RESULTS: Overall, 600 participants (413 female, 68.8%) were enrolled and followed-up for 12 months. In the intervention arm of 300 participants, 298 (99.3%) opted for IVR and 2 (0.7%) chose SMS text messaging as the mode of receiving reminders and health tips. At 12 months, there was no overall difference in the QoL between the intervention and control arms (DID=0.0; P=.99) or HIV RNA (DID=0.01; P=.94). At 12 months, 124 of the 256 (48.4%) active participants had picked up at least 50% of the calls. In the active intervention participants, high users (received >75% of reminders) had overall higher QoL compared to low users (received <25% of reminders) (92.2 versus 87.8, P=.02). Similarly, high users also had higher QoL scores in the mental health domain (93.1 versus 86.8, P=.008) and better appointment keeping. Similarly, participants with moderate use (51%-75%) had better viral suppression at 12 months (80/94, 85% versus 11/19, 58%, P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was high uptake and acceptability of the IVR tool. While we found no overall difference in the QoL and viral suppression between study arms, people living with HIV with higher usage of the tool showed greater improvements in QoL, viral suppression, and appointment keeping. With the declining resources available to HIV programs and the increasing number of people living with HIV accessing ART, IVR technology could be used to support patient care. The tool may be helpful in situations where physical consultations are infeasible, including the current COVID epidemic.

"The 'Wish to Die' in later life: prevalence, longitudinal course and mortality Data from TILDA","BACKGROUND: 'Wish to Die' (WTD) involves thoughts of or wishes for one's own death or that one would be better off dead. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence, longitudinal course and mortality-risk of WTD in community-dwelling older people. DESIGN: Observational study with 6-year follow-up. SETTING: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative cohort of older adults. SUBJECTS: In total, 8,174 community-dwelling adults aged &#8805;50Â years. METHODS: To define WTD, participants were asked: 'In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead?' Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. RESULTS: At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41-9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33-8.67)) were independently associated with WTD.Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2Â years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (-44%) and loneliness (-19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up.Fifteen per cent of participants expressing WTD at Wave 1 died during a 6-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: WTD amongst community-dwelling older people is frequently transient and is strongly linked with the course of depressive symptoms and loneliness. An enhanced focus on improving access to mental health care and addressing social isolation in older people should therefore be a public health priority, particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Briggs, Robert; Ward, Mark; Kenny, Rose Anne","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab010","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Age Ageing;2021 Feb 11.; Publication details: Age Ageing;2021 Feb 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10887,""
"Negative shocks predict change in cognitive function and preferences: assessing the negative affect and stress hypothesis","In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, households throughout the world have to cope with negative shocks. Previous research has shown that negative shocks impair cognitive function and change risk, time and social preferences. In this study, we analyze the results of a longitudinal multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N = 1652), Spain (N = 1660) and the United Kingdom (N = 1578). We measure cognitive function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits (risk, time and social preferences) using an experimentally validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in preferences. Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity). Data do not support the hypotheses that the result is driven by stress or by negative emotions.","Bogliacino, Francesco; Codagnone, Cristiano; Montealegre, Felipe; Folkvord, Frans; GÃ³mez, Camilo; Charris, Rafael; Liva, Giovanni; LupiÃ¡Ã±ez-Villanueva, Francisco; Veltri, Giuseppe A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83089-0","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sci Rep;11(1): 3546, 2021 02 11.; Publication details: Sci Rep;11(1): 3546, 2021 02 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10888,""

"The proportion and associated factors of anxiety in Chinese adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: Given the serious impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of Chinese adolescents, this study aimed to examine the proportion of anxiety and its correlates among Chinese adolescents with depression during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted from February 20th to February 27, 2020 in China. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), respectively. RESULTS: In this study, 3,498 adolescents with depression were identified. Of them, the proportion of anxiety was 45.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]=43.5%-46.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that being concerned about graduation (OR=1.25, P=0.002, 95% CI=1.09-1.43), sleep duration <6hr/day (OR=1.80, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.38-2.34), study duration >8hr/day (OR=1.21, P=0.02, 95% CI=1.03-1.42), and quantity of homework higher than before (OR=1.68, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.40-2.02) were positively associated with anxiety; the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at a provincial level of 100-999 (OR=0.70, P<0.001, 95% CI=0.59-0.83) and 1,000-9,999 (OR=0.69, P=0.001, 95% CI=0.55-0.87) were negatively related to anxiety in adolescents with depression. LIMITATIONS: Because this was a cross-sectional online study, the causality between variables and anxiety could not be examined among depressed adolescents. The use of self-reported scales may lead to an underestimation of the proportion of anxiety among adolescents with depression. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of anxiety were common in adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak. Timing screening and targeted interventions are necessary to mitigate the risks of mental illness of adolescents.","Liu, Rui; Chen, Xu; Qi, Han; Feng, Yuan; Xiao, Le; Yuan, Xiao-Fei; Li, Ya-Qiong; Huang, Huan-Huan; Pao, Christine; Zheng, Yi; Wang, Gang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.020","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;284: 114-119, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;284: 114-119, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10890,""
"Compromising situation of India's bio-medical waste incineration units during pandemic outbreak of COVID-19: Associated environmental-health impacts and mitigation measures","COVID-19 induced pandemic situations have put the bio-medical waste (BMW) management system, of the world, to test. Sudden influx, of COVID-infected patients, in health-care facilities, has increased the generation of yellow category BMW (Y-BMW) and put substantial burden on the BMW-incineration units of India. This study presents the compromising situation of the BMW-incineration units of India, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, from 21st March 2020 to 31st August 2020. This analysis revealed that on an average each COVID-infected patient in India generates approximately 3.41Â kg/d of BMW and average proportion of Y-BMW in it is 50.44%. Further, it was observed that on 13th July 2020, the total Y-BMW, generated by both the normal and COVID-infected patients, fully utilized the BMW-incineration capacity of India. Also, it was made evident that, during the study period, BMW-incineration emitted several pollutants and their concentration was in the order: NOxÂ >Â COÂ >Â SOxÂ >Â PMÂ >Â HClÂ >Â CdÂ >Â PbÂ >Â HgÂ >Â PCBsÂ >Â NiÂ >Â CrÂ >Â BeÂ >Â As. Subsequently, life time cancer risk assessment depicted that with hazard quotient >10-6, Cd may induce carcinogenic health impacts on both the adults and children of India. Therefore, to mitigate the environmental-health impacts associated with the incineration of BMW, evaluation of various options, viz., alternative technologies, substitution of raw materials and separate treatment of specific wastes, was also done. It is expected that the findings of this study may encourage the global auditory comprising scientific community and authorities to adopt alternate BMW-management strategies during the pandemic.","Thind, Parteek Singh; Sareen, Arjun; Singh, Dapinder Deep; Singh, Sandeep; John, Siby","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116621","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Environ Pollut;276: 116621, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication details: Environ Pollut;276: 116621, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10891,""
"Trends in suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in a major German city","It remains unclear whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates (SR). Economic insecurity and mental disorders are risk factors for suicide, which may increase during the pandemic. Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years (LY) were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations and linear time trends, suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with data from 2010 to 2019 using an interrupted time series analysis. A total of 643 suicides were registered and 6 032 690 LY were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 53 suicides and 450 429 LY accounted for the year 2020.In 2020, SR (suicides per 100 000 LY) were lower in periods with severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.2, Ãâ€¡2 = 4.033, p = 0.045) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 16.8). A comparison with previous years showed that this difference was caused by unusually high SR before the imposition of restrictions, while SR during the pandemic were within the trend corridor of previous years (expected suicides = 32.3, observed suicides = 35; IRR = 1.084, p = 0.682). SR during COVID-19 pandemic are in line with the trend in previous years. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalised.","Radeloff, Papsdorf, Uhlig, Vasilache, Putnam, von Klitzing","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796021000019","20210218","COVID-19; Germany; pandemic; quarantine; restrictions; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10892,""
"A Review and Response to the Early Mental Health and Neurological Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has infected millions of people and upended the lives of most humans on the planet. Researchers from across the psychological sciences have sought to document and investigate the impact of COVID-19 in myriad ways, causing an explosion of research that is broad in scope, varied in methods, and challenging to consolidate. Because policy and practice aimed at helping people live healthier and happier lives requires insight from robust patterns of evidence, this paper provides a rapid and thorough summary of high-quality studies published in 2020 addressing two overarching questions. First, what are the mental health consequences of living through the COVID-19 pandemic? Second, what are the neurological sequelae of contracting COVID-19? Our review of the evidence indicates that some facets of mental health suffered greatly during the early months of the pandemic (e.g., anxiety and depression increased), while other facets (life satisfaction) and correlates (social connection, loneliness) notably displayed resilience. In addition, early neurological data indicate several consequences of contracting COVID-19, both during infection and after recovery. In response to these insights, we present seven recommendations (1 urgent, 2 short-term, 4 ongoing) to support mental health and well-being during the pandemic and beyond.","Lara Beth Aknin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-E74-2D7","20210219","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; happiness; self-harm; mental health; social connection; covid-19; well-being; loneliness","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10893,""
"The Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6): A new instrument for assessing anxiety response to viral epidemics in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have reported experiencing anxiety in response to the viral epidemic. This study aimed to explore the validity and usefulness of the Stress and Anxiety to the Viral Epidemic-6 items (SAVE-6) scale for measuring the anxiety response to the viral epidemic of the general population. A total of 1,009 respondents participated in an online survey, and 501 (49.7%) participants were rated as having at least a mild degree of anxiety response to the viral epidemic (SAVE-6 score = 15), whereas 90 (8.9%) and 91 (9.0%) were rated as having depression and anxiety, respectively. The SAVE-6 scales showed good internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s a = .82). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a one-factor structure for the measure. Goodness-of-fit indices (<U+03C7>2/df ratio = 19.1, CFI = .92; TLI = .86; SRMR = 0.05; RMSEA = .13) were adequate. The SAVE-6 was found to be a reliable, valid, and useful brief measure that can be applied to the general population. The SAVE-6 may be useful for easily assessing the anxiety symptoms during the pandemic in the general population.","Seockhoon Chung Md et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E2-169-B95","20210219","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; anxiety; general population; stress; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10894,""
"â€˜Stressed, uncomfortable, vulnerable, neglectedâ€™: a qualitative study of frontline keyworker experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","Aims: Non-healthcare keyworkers face distinct occupational vulnerabilities that have received little consideration within broader debates about â€˜essentialâ€™ work and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives and mental health and wellbeing of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services and the police force. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a reflexive thematic approach. Results: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient PPE and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. Conclusion: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (e.g. seasonal influenza) in the future. This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.","Tom May et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46142-BD7-DC1","20210219","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; keyworkers; frontline services; qualitative; covid-19; psychological wellbeing","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-19","",10895,""
