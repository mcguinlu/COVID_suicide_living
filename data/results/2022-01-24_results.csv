"Investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological wellbeing and cognitive function of older adolescents","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic coincides with growing concern regarding the mental health of young people. Older adolescents have faced a particular set of pandemic-related challenges and demonstrate heightened vulnerability to affective disorders (particularly anxiety). Anxiety symptoms are associated with a range of cognitive difficulties. As such, older adolescents may be susceptible to pandemic-related declines in both wellbeing and cognitive function. Methods: At three timepoints, independent samples of young people aged 16-18 years (N = 607, 242, 618 respectively) completed an online survey. Data collection coincided with periods of lockdown (timepoints 1 and 3) and young people returning to school (timepoint 2). The survey assessed subjective impacts of the pandemic on overall wellbeing, anxiety and cognitive function. Results: Findings demonstrated the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adolescentsâ€™ psychological wellbeing. Crucially, heightened anxiety was associated with self-identified cognitive difficulties, and this pattern of association was sustained in subsequent independent samples. Furthermore, the nature and extent of these difficulties were predictive of particular pandemic-related concerns in this age group. Conclusions: Older adolescentsâ€™ experiences of the pandemic are characterised by a clear pattern of association between anxiety and self-identified cognitive difficulties, which was sustained over time. Implications are discussed with reference to both future research and intervention.

"Effects of racism and discrimination on mental health problems among young people in Victoria, Australia during COVID-19 lockdown","Racism and discrimination are fundamental determinants of health inequities, with children and young people particularly vulnerable. Reports of racism and discrimination rose sharply in 2020 along with the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We examined racism, discrimination (e.g. direct, vicarious, heightened vigilance, and worries about experiencing racial discrimination), COVID-19 pandemic related stressors (e.g. access to support services, changes to personal relationships, and financial hardship) and their associations with mental health problems (e.g. worry, lack of concentration, and irritability) using a series of linear regression models in young people during the Australian national COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. Data was collected using the Racism During COVID-19 survey, a community-based, cross-sectional online survey. 363 young people aged 16-24 living in Victoria, Australia were included in our analysis, 45.4% self-identified as being from a multicultural background and 3.7% as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. 73.7% reported direct discrimination, 88.9% reported vicarious discrimination, 84.3% reported heightened vigilance and, 62.8% reported worries about experiencing racial discrimination. Half (51.3%) the participants experienced one or two COVID-19 related stressors and one third (34.2%) experienced three or more. Almost all (91.9%) reported high levels for two or more negative mental health problems. Experiences of direct discrimination, vicarious racism, heightened vigilance, worries about experiencing racial discrimination, and multiple COVID-19 related stressors (3+) were each associated with negative mental health problems, after adjusting for ethnicity, age and gender and socio-economic position. Addressing racism and discrimination is critical to addressing social determinants of health for young people.","Kate Doery et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0246-A62-19D","20220124","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; racism; australia; covid-19; discrimination; young people","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-24","",25847,""
