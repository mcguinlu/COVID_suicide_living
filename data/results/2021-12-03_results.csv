"Racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mental health during COVID-19","Knowledge of childbirth outcomes of Black and Latinx individuals during the coronavirus pandemic is limited. Black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic individuals were matched to non-Hispanic white individuals on socio-demographics. Minority individuals were nearly three times more likely to have clinically significant traumatic stress in response to childbirth and two times more likely to report postpartum depression. Unplanned Cesarean rates were higher and incidences of skin-to-skin and breastfeeding were lower in the minority group.

"Increased risk of psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is highest early in the clinical course","Background: COVID-19 has been shown to increase the risk of adverse mental health consequences. A recent electronic health record (EHR)-based observational study showed an almost two-fold increased risk of new-onset mental illness in the first 90 days following a diagnosis of acute COVID-19. Methods: We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, a harmonized EHR repository with 2,965,506 COVID-19 positive patients, and compared cohorts of COVID-19 patients with comparable controls. Patients were propensity score-matched to control for confounding factors. We estimated the hazard ratio (COVID-19:control) for new-onset of mental illness for the first year following diagnosis. We additionally estimated the change in risk for new-onset mental illness between the periods of 21-120 and 121-365 days following infection. Findings: We find a significant increase in incidence of new-onset mental disorders in the period of 21-120 days following COVID-19 (3.8%, 3.6-4.0) compared to patients with respiratory tract infections (3%, 2.8-3.2). We further show that the risk for new-onset mental illness decreases over the first year following COVID-19 diagnosis compared to other respiratory tract infections and demonstrate a reduced (non-significant) hazard ratio over the period of 121-365 days following diagnosis. Similar findings are seen for new-onset anxiety disorders but not for mood disorders. Interpretation: Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 are at an increased risk for developing new-onset mental illness, especially anxiety disorders. This risk is most prominent in the first 120 days following infection.","Ben Coleman; Elena Casiraghi; Hannah Blau; Lauren Chan; Melissa A Haendel; Bryan Laraway; Tiffany J Callahan; Rachel R Deer; Ken Wilkins; Justin Reese; Peter N Robinson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.30.21267071","20211202","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23094,""
"Digital exclusion predicts worse mental health among adolescents during COVID-19","Background: Social isolation is strongly associated with poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions disrupted young people's social interactions and resulted in several periods during which school closures necessitated online learning. We hypothesise that digitally excluded young people would demonstrate greater deterioration in their mental health than their digitally connected peers during this time. Methods: We analysed representative mental health data from a sample of UK 10-15-year-olds (N = 1387); Understanding Society collected the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in 2017-19 and thrice during the pandemic (July 2020, November 2020 and March 2021). We employed cross-sectional methods and longitudinal latent growth curve modelling to describe trajectories of adolescent mental health for participants with and without access to a computer or a good internet connection for schoolwork. Outcomes: Adolescent mental health had a quadratic trajectory during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest mean Total Difficulties score around December 2020. The worsening and recovery of mental health during the pandemic was greatly pronounced among those without access to a computer, although we did not find evidence for a similar effect among those without a good internet connection. Interpretation: Digital exclusion, as indicated by lack of access to a computer, is a tractable risk factor that likely compounds other adversities facing children and young people during periods of social isolation.

"Telehealth impact on biomedical, psychosocial, and behavioural outcomes in patients with diabetes older than 50 years: A systematic synthesis without meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Elderly people with diabetes are among high-risk groups that require more attention. With the increasing use of technology in healthcare, much emphasis has been placed on telehealth because of its potential to reduce unnecessary healthcare services consumption. We aimed to review and analyse the evidence of various interventions on the effect of using telehealth on biomedical, behavioural, and psychosocial outcomes in patients with diabetes over 50 years. METHODS: The search method of this systematic synthesis without meta-analysis was guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (PRISMA) and the new reporting guideline synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) in systematic reviews. A coherent search strategy was designed to retrieve articles in databases such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to June 2020. We excluded articles with eligibility criteria of the age of under 50 years old and studies conducted on patients with gestational diabetes. The outcomes were categorized into biomedical, behavioural, and psychosocial outcomes. The methodology of articles was evaluated by the Standard Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool in Revman 5.3 software. FINDINGS: Overall, 18 studies with 8273 patients with diabetes over the age of 50 were included in this systematic review. Biomedical outcomes such as blood sugar tests and cholesterol tests had significant improvement by using telehealth. Frequency of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and self-efficacy were behavioural outcomes that increased by telehealth utilization. Telehealth had a positive impact on psychosocial outcomes like depression, quality of life (QoL), cognitive decline, and social support. INTERPRETATION: Telehealth has the ability to improve multiple outcomes such as behavioural and psychosocial outcomes in health services consumers. Due to varied telehealth interventions and follow-up durations, firm conclusions cannot be reached. As the research investigations studied in the present study were of different kinds and had used different follow-up periods, there is a need for further rigorous studies which consider socio-economic, cultural, and clinical differences.","Kaveh, Mohammad Hossein; Faradonbeh, Maryam Rabiey; Kaveh, Sara","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1357633X211052222","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Telemed Telecare;: 1357633X211052222, 2021 Nov 18.; Publication details: J Telemed Telecare;: 1357633X211052222, 2021 Nov 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23096,""
"'It gives you the skills of how you can cope': Exploring the self-reported experience of patients receiving in-centre haemodialysis on participating in chosen art activities","BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of patients are receiving dialysis, particularly in high-income countries. Patients receiving haemodialysis often experience fatigue, anxiety, depression and boredom. It is suggested that arts activities could have a therapeutic effect. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore patients' perspectives of participating while on dialysis in chosen arts and creative living activities provided by tutors at the bedside. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interviews in the interpretive tradition were conducted, with thematic analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients of different ages, genders and ethnicities who participated in an arts activity while receiving haemodialysis in an inner-city dialysis unit in England were included in this study. RESULTS: Participants reported positive experiences of engaging in art activities. Their views on the value of the activities were grouped into five themes: diversion from receiving haemodialysis, a sense of achievement, contribution to a more positive self-identity, increased confidence and motivation and a therapeutic talking relationship. Participants suggested that patient peer promotion of the activities could increase uptake, with patient choice of activity seen as important. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a chosen arts activity while receiving haemodialysis was perceived by patients to have positive psychosocial effects. We theorize three potential explanatory mechanisms for these effects: That the experience of participating in the activities engendered positive psychological states of 'being in the flow'; enhanced self-esteem to add to personal coping mechanisms; and offered additional facets to the patient's identity that countered the stigmatizing effect of receiving dialysis. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Patients and public representatives advised on the design, research methods and tools.","Taylor, Francesca; Drennan, Vari M; Turner, Marie-Louise; Jones, Jeunita; Popoola, Joyce","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hex.13337","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Expect;2021 Aug 11.; Publication details: Health Expect;2021 Aug 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23097,""
"Knowledge and attitudes toward vaccination among nurses and midwives in Cyprus: A cross-sectional study","PURPOSE: To assess the level of knowledge and attitudes of nurses and midwives in Cyprus toward vaccinations and provide new insights into the determinants that influence them. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was carried out during the period between December 08 and 28 2020. Participants included registered nurses and midwives working in public or private service provision. A self-administered questionnaire was used with questions about sociodemographic characteristics, questions assessing attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination, and participants' general vaccine knowledge. FINDINGS: A total of 437 responders answered the survey, with 93% being nurses and 7% midwives. Around two-thirds (67.3%) of the participants had a high vaccination knowledge, while the remaining have moderate (30.7%), and low (2.1%), respectively. Most of the participants agreed that by vaccinating they protect themselves and those around them (80.5%) and that when most people are not vaccinated, epidemics can easily initiate (74%). Oppositely, many participants disagreed with vaccination and avoided it due to a fear of injections (95.4%) or the belief that it is better to get sick rather than be vaccinated (69.1%). Neutral attitudes toward vaccine-mediated side effects (43.1%) and vaccination safety (41.7%) were observed. Sociodemographic factors such as age, educational status, and work setting significantly affected the nurses' and midwives' knowledge and attitudes toward vaccination (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the overall vaccination knowledge of participants was high, however, gaps in vaccination knowledge were observed. Individuals who adopted a neutral stance toward vaccination can be prone to changes either toward positive or negative attitudes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The survey findings suggest implementing educational strategies and targeted interventions in clinical settings to enhance nurses' and midwives' vaccination knowledge and awareness.","Fakonti, Georgia; Kyprianidou, Maria; Toumbis, Giannos; Giannakou, Konstantinos","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2047-3095.12354","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Nurs Knowl;2021 Nov 21.; Publication details: Int J Nurs Knowl;2021 Nov 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23098,""

"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Health Professionals Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Peru: An Analytical Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: To determine the association between depression, anxiety, and stress according to sociodemographic and occupational factors in Peruvian health professionals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional analytical and multicentre study, based on a virtual survey sent to Peruvian health personnel (from the 25 Peruvian regions) working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The three dependent variables (depression, anxiety, and stress) were measured with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 (DASS-21) (Cronbach's Alpha: 0.93) and compared with sociodemographic and occupational variables. P-values were obtained through generalized linear models, adjusted for each location where the survey was sent. Results: Of the 550 participants, 2%, 13%, and 3% of them had severe or very severe depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, we observed that professionals with a greater number of children had a lower frequency of severe depression (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 0.37;95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.79;p = 0.010). In addition, physicians had a lower frequency of severe anxiety (aPR: 0.37;95% CI: 0.18-0.75;p = 0.036), and professionals who lived in the Central region (aPR: 0.50;95% CI: 0.25-0.97;p = 0.042) and in the South of the country (aPR: 0.37;95% CI: 0.19-0.71;p = 0.003) had lower anxiety levels compared to those in the Northern region. With regard to severe stress, those who lived in the Central (aPR: 0.15;95% CI: 0.03-0.75;p = 0.021) and South regions (aPR: 0.19;95% CI: 0.04-0.79;p = 0.011) had lower stress levels. Conclusion: There were significant percentages of deteriorating mental health in Peruvian health professionals during the pandemic, which may have negative repercussions in the short-, medium-, and long-term. In this sense, additional governmental actions should be necessary to provide specific psychological and psychiatric support programs to these workers.

"Some Predictors of Perceived Support and Proximity in Students during COVID-19 Distance Learning","The results of the rare studies on the psychosocial aspects of distance education in the first wave of the epidemic showed the negative consequences of such education on various aspects of psychological well-being and mental health among primary, secondary school and university students. Significant deterioration in psychosocial well-being was also found in studies of university students, who reported increased stress, anxiety, feelings of loneliness, and depression as a result of reduced social networks, lack of interactions, and less emotional support from peers and friends (Elmer et al., 2020;Eving et al., 2021). Studies show a positive relationship between teacher support and learning skills (Patrick et al., 2007), intrinsic motivation (Ryan et al., 1994), and, by encouraging student involvement, student achievement (Klem & Connell, 2004). In distance education, students are required to regulate their own learning and maintain motivation to achieve learning objectives, which they are often unable to do (Fryer & Bovee, 2016). [...]in order to achieve the learning objectives, the teacher's support is needed more than in regular classes in school.","Pecjak, Sonja, Pirc, Tina, Podlesek, Anja, Peklaj, Cirila","https://doi.org/10.26822/iejee.2021.228","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education; 14(1):51-62, 2021.; Publication details: International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education; 14(1):51-62, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23104,""

"New management and trauma incidence in hand surgery during the phase 1 of COVID-19 pandemic in a referral hand surgery and microsurgery center into the outbreak in North Italy","BACKGROUND: This is a retrospective study of the casuistry occurred at the Hand Surgery and Microsurgery HUB Center of Emilia-Romagna during the months of March and April 2020 in the peak of Phase 1 of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, comparing the data with the same period in 2019. METHODS: A more relevant reduction of 92.3% in elective surgery and a significantly less relevant reduction of 37.2% in emergencies was recorded. Replantation did not present reduction while cutting lesions of tendons and saw injuries increased such as the injuries during domestic activities. RESULTS: The incidence of hand trauma looks not only at the traditional field of artisanal and industrial injuries, but also to the most recorded accidents in daily life activities. The data evidenced the significantly increase of the injuries occurring in the domestic environment. The 72.8% of emergencies was treated in day-service with significantly reduction in hospitalization, costs and infective risks. Telemedicine implementation has experienced to upgrade the relationship in the emergency network. CONCLUSIONS: Hand injuries remained a major issue also during the lockdown. A functional and skill emergency service and day-service during the phase 1 COVID-19 pandemic played a relevant role in efficacy and efficiency. The utility of telemedicine was greatly limited by liability and risk management issues.","Acciaro, A.

We analyzed data on completed suicides in Saint Petersburg, Udmurtia Republic (Russia), and Odessa region (Ukraine), 6375 cases overall among population groups with total number of people being equal to 9,216 thousand starting from January 01, 2016 to December 31, 2020. Confidence intervals for frequencies as per months (per 100,000 people) in 2020 were calculated as per Wilson and compared with average ones calculated for 2016â€“2019. There was a decrease in frequency of completed suicides in all three population groups during a period when the strictest quarantine measures were valid;by the mid-summer the trend normalized or there was even a slight increase. When the second pandemic wave came, changes were multidirectional;in particular, in Saint Petersburg there was another decrease by the end of the year, the most apparent and statistically significant among men whereas there were short-term rises in Udmurtia and Odessa. Our comparison performed for population groups with initially different levels of suicides confirms that right after a crisis starts, suicidal behavior becomes less frequent among people;however, as a response to the second pandemic wave, we can expect both falls and rises in number of suicides and it requires more intense preventive activities.

"Teaching in Countryside Education in the context of COVID-19","Education in the countryside is a result of historical fights for the rights of property, education, social justice, and labor. The COVID-19 Pandemic highlighted the existing vulnerabilities and precariousness, and alongside the social isolation came the need to cope with mental health issues and psychosocial support for countryside teachers. This paper aims to present an analysis on the implications of COVID-19 Pandemic in mental and psychosocial health of the countryside teachers. Five countryside education professionals were interviewed, one from each Brazilian region. Online semi-structured interviews were analysed by discourse analysis. The findings showed situations leading to psychological distress as well as critical protective processes, which promoted mental health in the pandemic context. Pedagogical practices from distance have turned the situation of countryside education and its educators even more precarious and vulnerable. The pandemic accelerated processes of depersonalisation and devaluation of countryside education.","Lopes, J. C.; Noal, D. D.; Magrin, N. P.; Lira, G. F. C.; da Silva, M. T.

"Research paper: Depression associated with COVID-19 and its impact on physical activities of young adults of Pakistan","Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses with unknown etiology, which firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. All educational institutes of Pakistan were completely closed from March 13, 2020, to August 15, 2020. This condition disturbs the daily routines of children with mental health needs. This sudden closure limited their physical activities in their routine life. This study aims to observe the depression associated with COVID-19 and its impact on the physical activities of young adults of Pakistan. Materials and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 young adults. A modified depression scale was used to assess depression, and the revised physical activity questionnaire was used to evaluate the physical activity of Pakistani young adults in the past month. Results: About 57.8% of the samples were sometimes sad;44.5% sometimes felt grouchy in the mood;43.8% never felt hopeless about the future. Also, 32.6% sometimes slept less or more than usual, 35.9% sometimes had difficulty concentrating on their work, 48.7% slept 6-8 hours per day. Besides, 49% engaged 1-3 hours in work or study per day;43.2% watched TV, sat quietly, or listened to music for 1-3 hours. About 57.8% engaged less than 1 hour per week in light physical activities. Also, 77.9% engaged for less than 1 hour per week in moderately strenuous activities. Conclusion: Depression could be highly associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, and it might affect the physical activities of young adults. Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.","Samejo, B.; Noonari, S.

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Chinese population: An online survey","BACKGROUND The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic infiltrates every aspect of our life, including the psychological impact. China has experienced the first wave of this epidemic, and it is now affecting the global population. AIM This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among the general Chinese population. METHODS A detailed questionnaire, comprising of 38 questions designed in both English and Chinese, was developed. The survey was conducted via WeChat, a multipurpose messaging, social media, and mobile payment app, which is widely used by the Chinese population. RESULTS In total, 1082 individuals from 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities participated in the survey by filling the questionnaires through the WeChat app. 97.8% of the participants had an Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R) total score above 20, which is an indicator of PTSD. The IES-R total and all the three subscales, including intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, are significantly correlated with age. In addition, age, profession, marital status, and level of education are significantly correlated with the degree of PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 epidemic has widely caused PTSD among the general Chinese population. These results bear important implications for regions struggling with the pandemic to implement effective interventions to cope with these mental health problems. Â©The Author(s) 2021.

"Knowledge, Attitude and Awareness about Eating, Sleeping, Weight, Diet and Other Lifestyle Changes during COVID Pandemic","Background and Aim: COVID pandemic lockdown has been constantly associated with psychological changes which have resulted in an increase in stress level and other diseases. So the main aim of this study is to create knowledge about the lifestyle, sleeping and other changes happening during pandemic situations. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted among the dental population with a sample size of 100 to 150. The survey was done in an online questionnaire pattern through Google forms and circulated. The statistics were done using SPSS software, chi square test was used to check the association and P value of 0.05 was said to be statistically significant. Results: 36.63% responded to intake of vegetables as slight increases and 36.63% responded to significant increase of fruits and vegetables. There were many positive as well as negative changes were observed like increase in screen time and low physical activity were considered to be negative and positive changes like decrease in smoking and drinking alcohol. COVID-19 marginally improved the eating behavior, yet one-third of participants gained weight as physical activity declined significantly coupled with an increase in screen and sitting time. Mental health was also adversely affected. Intake of a balanced diet was significantly increased in females than males. Nearly 42% of them significantly increased their sleeping hours. Conclusion: The increase of COVID virus all over the world at a faster rate may distract people from attention over lifestyle, physical and mental health. The mental issues may result in severe consequences. People must be aware that a healthy lifestyle change may cause severe health issues. A detailed understanding of these factors can help to develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviors that have manifested during COVID-19.","Immanuel, J.; Devi, R. G.; Priya, A.

"Psychological and Clinical Predictors of COVID-19 Severity and Outcomes","Objective The present study aimed to assess the psychological and clinical determinants of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their association with the disease severity and outcomes. Methods This prospective study was conducted at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar-Pakistan. Admitted patients were screened for COVID-19 with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequently, 250 COVID positive patients were included in the final analysis. Data were obtained from the patient's medical chart;demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Psychological determinants, including anxiety and depression, were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The predictors of disease severity and outcomes (recovery vs. mortality) were also studied. Results A total of 250 patients were included in this study;out of which, 193 patients recovered from this deadly virus and 57 died. Based on psychological assessment, 58.4% of the enrolled COVID-19 patients had poor HADS scores. Most of the patients who died (70.2%) had severe symptoms (poor HADS scores). Similarly, 49.6% of the total cases were observed with poor HADS, and 50.9% of those who died had severe depression. Conclusion It is concluded from the study results that psychological distress is frequent in COVID-19 patients. Age, hypertension, fatigue, abnormal respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, ferritin, and poor HADS sore were determined as the significant predictors of COVID-19 severity and outcomes.","Shah, M.

"Self-reported Anxiety and Coping: A Cross-Sectional Study among Saudi Nursing Students during COVID-19 Pandemic using GAD-7 and Briefcope","Background: Anxiety is seen among students even during normal times. The COVID-19pandemic is believed to have increased anxiety and depression among the students. Purpose: An investigation was done to assess the anxiety levels and coping strategies of nursing students in Saudi Arabia. The influence of demographics on the anxiety levels and coping strategies were also determined. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire through Google forms. The questionnaire had items related to demographics such as age, sex, etc., along with a question to know about the confidence of students to work as nurses. A GAD-7 scale was used to assess anxiety levels and BriefCope was used to determine coping strategies. Statistics were performed using non-parametric tests, factorial analysis, and linear regression. Results: More than half of the participating students experienced moderate to severe anxiety. The anxiety levels were not influenced significantly by demographics except the young age. More than 50% of the students were reluctant to work as nurses and this affected the anxiety score significantly. Factorial analysis grouped variables into six factors. Linear regression showed a positive correlation of these factors with anxiety. Conclusion: Anxiety score revealed that Saudi nursing students had moderate to severe anxiety. The combined number of students reluctant or scared to work was more than those who were confident to work as nurses. A positive association was observed between factor variables with mild and moderate anxiety.","Asad, M.; Alenezi, A.; Alsalowly, M. N.; Asdaq, S. M. B.; Alamri, A. S.; Alsanie, W.

"Increased Levels of Anxiety, Depression, and Secondary Trauma in Radiation Oncologists during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Preliminary Report from Turkey","OBJECTIVE We surveyed the anxiety, depression, and secondary trauma levels of Turkish Radiation Oncologists related with COVID pandemics. METHODS An anonymous online questionnaire survey was created to evaluate levels of depression, anxiety, and secondary trauma among Turkish Radiation Oncologists. The survey included demographics and occupational status, Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSSS), The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS Seventy-two respondents provided the power of about 91.4% for the significance level of 0.05. The variance homogeneity was checked by the Levene test, the effect of COVID-19 on psychology is higher in the group of &gt;19 (9.02 +/- 0.820), as well as the effect of social isolation (8.02 +/- 1.622), the STSS scores (34.28 +/- 9.062), the STAIS scores (60.46 +/- 5.296), the STAIT scores (82.21 +/- 9.298), the BDI scores (22.68 +/- 2.788), and the BAI scores (21.04 +/- 9.321). The multiple regressions to estimate BDI revealed statistically significant effects in STAIS, BAI, and STAIT. There is a significant correlation between STSS, STAIS, STAIT, BDI, BAI, the effect of COVID-19 on psychology, and the effect of social isolation. CONCLUSION We have established one of the first studies demonstrating the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on depression, anxiety levels, and secondary trauma on a special physician population, the Radiation Oncologists, who specifically do not directly take part in COVID19 management.","Kilic Durankus, N.

"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Lysosomal Storage Disorders","Aim: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a worldwide public health emergency, especially affecting people with chronic illnesses including lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). The unfavorable conditions due to COVID-19 have mostly affected people with chronic conditions, in terms of disease vulnerability and access to health-care. In the present study, we aimed to assess the problems the patients with LSDs on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have encountered during the pandemic, and their level of anxiety. Parental evaluation has also been made for pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 19 participants were recruited. A semi-structured interview was structured to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on ERT. The Turkish version of ""Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale"" (HADS) for adult patients and parents were used to evaluate anxiety. Patients between ages 8-17 completed the child version of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression scale (RCADS). Results: The study was completed by 19 patients, and 13 parents. Five patients (26%) admitted temporary disruption of treatment, of which the most common reason was the fear of getting infected. Eighty-nine percent of all participants were willing to receive treatment at home. Only one adult patient revealed to feel anxiety (16%). While among parents evaluated with HADS, 7/13 had scores that indicated depression and anxiety, 3/4 pediatric patients had RCADS scores indicative of anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The problems LSD patients have been facing during the pandemic, should be identified along with their attitudes regarding ERT in order to maintain the sustainability of their treatment. The psychological health of these patients should also be identified and supported, to provide optimal care to patients.","Olgaci, A.; Kasapkara, C. S.; Acikel, B.; Yildiz, Y.; Molla, G.

"COVID-19 impact on mental health, sleep quality and various aspects of life of medical students and interns, and nonmedical students: A comparative study in Indian scenario","Context: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all the age groups, especially worsening the already stressful life of college students. Aims: The aims are to study the differences in the COVID-19 impact on mental health including depression, sleep quality, and various areas of life in undergraduate students (medical and nonmedical) and medical interns. Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional study in the form of an online survey was conducted through Google Form containing the questionnaire having Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), questions pertaining to the different aspects of life affected due to COVID-19. Statistical Analysis Used: The results of the groups were compared using two sample t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results: A total of 355 students responded (202 medical and 101 nonmedical students and 52 medical interns). The difference in psychological distress and sleep quality was statistically significant in all three groups. The average scores of K10 depicted psychological distress being moderate in nonmedical and mild in medical students and interns;of PSQI showed the prevalence of poor sleep quality being maximum in interns and minimum in medical students. 40% medical students reported positive impact on diet and about half of the medical and nonmedical students on familial relationships. Conclusions: Statistically significant differences in the three study groups with respect to psychological distress, sleep quality, and COVID-19 impact on various aspects of life indicate the requirement of identification of their different needs and required interventions including mental health support, possibly at the institutional levels are the need of the hour.","Nagose, V.; Soni, D.; Rathod, S.; Yelne, Y.","https://doi.org/10.4103/aip.aip_79_21","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Annals of Indian Psychiatry; 5(2):158-163, 2021.; Publication details: Annals of Indian Psychiatry; 5(2):158-163, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23118,""
"Mental health problems in health-care workers working in COVID-19 quarantine centers","Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in India has put health-care workers (HCWs) under intense pressure and has led to immense psychological stress due to factors including a high risk of infection, inadequate protection from contamination, overwork, cutting-off with families, and exhaustion. The unprecedented stressful conditions are causing mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, disturbed sleep, irritability, fear, and panic. The present study was carried out to investigate the mental health problems among HCWs working in close proximity with COVID-19 patients in quarantine centers and to explore the relevant influencing factors for the development of psychological interventions for them. Subject and Methods: HCWs working in COVID-19 quarantine centers in Ajmer were interviewed for exploring mental health problems in a cross-sectional study carried out at JLN Medical College, Ajmer, India. Depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress among HCWs were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Relevant data were analyzed, and comparisons between different groups were performed using the two independent sample t-tests. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 22.0 for Windows. Results: 53.57% (n = 30) of participants were suffering from depressive symptoms, 64.28% (n = 36) were suffering from anxiety symptoms, and 78.6% (n = 47) were suffering from stress. HCWs living in joint families were more affected by depression (P = 0.02). Both anxiety and stress were more commonly reported by HCWs of age &lt;30, females, nurses and those living in joint families, but difference was statistically insignificant. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that a considerable number of HCWs were suffering from mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress. It is important to have periodic mental health assessment of HCWs dealing with COVID-19 patients.","Meena, P.; Jilowa, C.; Sharma, A.; Jain, M.; Nainwani, N.; Palawat, M.; Ashish, P.","https://doi.org/10.4103/aip.aip_73_21","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Annals of Indian Psychiatry; 5(2):153-157, 2021.; Publication details: Annals of Indian Psychiatry; 5(2):153-157, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23119,""
"Antidepressant compliance in depression during the COVID pandemic: Identifying the potential poor compliers in an industrial hospital","Background: Depression epidemic is likely to follow the COVID pandemic. Depression is treatable if compliance is good. The study was aimed at identifying risk factors of poor antidepressant compliance during a pandemic. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four poor compliers of antidepressants during COVID period were compared with equal number of poor compliers of pre-COVID period on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The retrospective study was designed in a way to eliminate biases due to usual patient, social, or clinical factors. The hypothesis was that there would be some factors of antidepressant poor compliance exclusive to pandemic and these factors would be beyond the usual factors. Results: Majority (n = 43, 67%) of COVID period poor compliers were family members of employees. Subjects who came for prescription refill (n = 17, 27%) than consultation were poor compliant during COVID period. COVID period poor compliers (n = 6, 9%) were admitted less compared to pre-COVID counterparts (n = 15, 23%). COVID period subjects had mood symptoms predominant depression (n = 44, 69%) than physical symptoms (n = 20, 31%). The presence of death wish or suicidal ideas was significant (n = 16, 25%) in COVID period. Poor compliers of pandemic (n = 26, 41%) had more psychosocial stress (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The study did find some exclusive factors apart from doctor-patient relationship for good compliance.

"The Development of POTENSIA;The Android-Based Psychological Application for Mapping and Assessments of Student Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Students experience various essential changes related to their psychological conditions during their education in college. Students' adaptability to the demands of these changes will give birth to new skills for the next stage of psychological development. However, academic stress, social problems, career, and personal-emotional problems can hinder the productivity and development of students in terms of mental health. This issue increased with the new-normal life during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also impacted the education process. For this reason, it is necessary to have a mobile-based online psychological assessment to map the mental health conditions of students during the pandemic. This study aims to develop and validate an Android-based online psychological assessment application to map students' mental health conditions. This study involved ten experts in counseling and software development, five counselors, and 638 users of the POTENSIA application. According to application development needs, data analysis using Aiken's V coefficient test, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Rasch Model Analysis. The results of the study prove that the application is considered valid and practical to use. The effectiveness of the application is considered very good in mapping the mental health conditions of students. Â© 2021.

"Mental health of medical staff and general public in the COVID-19 epidemic in Yanâ€™an","Objective: To explore the mental health state of medical staff and general public in Yanâ€™an in the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: From 10th February to 9th March 2020, an online questionnaire survey was conducted among 886 medical staff and 722 general public in Yanâ€™an. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale(GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-9) and PHQ-15 were used to screen anxiety, depression and somatic symptoms respectively. Results: In this sample, the prevalence of anxiety, depression and somatic symptoms in medical staff were 38.7%, 33.4% and 42.6% respectively, while those in general public were 42.5%, 32.8% and 31.4%. General public(OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65) had higher risk of anxiety symptoms than medical staff, while medical staff(OR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.03-1.89) had higher risk of somatic symptoms than general public. The prevalence of somatic symptoms of medical staff in non-tertiary hospitals were higher than that of medical statf in tertiary hospitals(48.6% vs 36.1%, P &lt;0. 01). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 epidemic, the medical staff in Yanâ€™an have higher risk of somatic symptoms and lower risk of anxiety symptoms than the general public. Medical staff in non-tertiary hospitals have a higher risk of somatic symptoms.

"Social support and acceptance commitment therapy on subjective well-being and mental health of covid-19 patient","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic does not only have a physical impact on the sufferers, restrictions on social interaction, and the existence of negative stigma from residents, but also have an impact on mental health and self-assessment on the patient. Nursing interventions can improve the mental health and happiness of patients, namely by providing social support and providing acceptance commitment therapy by the health workers. The provision of social support and acceptance commitment therapy aims to produce a meaningful life for patients undergoing treatment. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of social support and acceptance commitment therapy on subjective well-being and mental health of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The research design used is quasi-experimental research with dependent pre-test and post-test samples. The sampling technique used is consecutive sampling to determine the sample according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a total sample of 106 respondents who were divided into 53 respondents for the intervention group and 53 respondents for the control group. The independent variables in this study are social support and acceptance commitment therapy. Meanwhile, the dependent variables in this study are subjective well-being and mental health. The instruments used in this research are The Social Support Questionnaire, Mental Health Inventory, and Satisfaction with Life Scale. Statistical analysis was conducted using t-test with p &lt; 0.5. RESULTS: The results show that in the intervention group, the difference in mean subjective well-being before and after the intervention is 6.88, while the difference in the mean of mental health before and after the intervention is 39.71. Furthermore, in the control group, the difference in mean subjective well-being before and after the intervention is 0.17, while the difference in the mean of mental health before and after the intervention is 0.02. Data analysis shows that social support and acceptance commitment therapy had an effect on subjective well-being and mental health of COVID-19 patients with p = 0.00. CONCLUSION: The provision of social support and acceptance commitment therapy can be done as a preventive effort to maintain the mental health and subjective well-being of COVID-19 patients during the treatment period both in the hospital and independent isolation at home.

"REaCH-Resiliency Engagement and Care in Health;a Befriending Intervention to Address the Psycho-Social Challenges of Vulnerable Youth in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Trial in India","The study explores the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of a befriending intervention delivered by trained lay health workers to address the issues of the rural youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. We did an exploratory trial with 501 upskilled youth, where we randomly recruited 251 to the intervention group (REaCH) and 250 to the control group (General Enquiry Telephone Call-GETC). The outcome variables included in the study were depressive symptoms, wellbeing, and social support. The majority of the participants were females (64.2%), unmarried (63.55%), and hailed from economically poorer households (57.63%). The befriending intervention reduced depressive symptoms (OR: 0.95, p = 0.05) and significantly improved social support (OR: 1.03, p = 0.000) among participants in the intervention group. The participants in the intervention group had higher perceived social support from friends, families, and significant others when compared to the control group. Additionally, suicidality scores decreased for people in the intervention group from baseline to follow up;however, the results were not statistically significant. Befriending intervention is a practical, low-cost technique to sustain the youth in employment and ensure sustainable income. It inspires practitioners and policymakers to create mental health gatekeeping. The trial was registered prospectively on 27 July 2020 in Clinical Trial Registry India;ICMR-NIMS (Registration Number: CTRI/2020/07/026834).","Devassy, Saju Madavanakadu, Scaria, Lorane, Kalluparambil Kesavan, Shaju, Cheguvera, Natania, Joseph, Mannooparambil K.; Benny, Anuja Maria, Binoy, Joseph","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132212920","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(22):12920, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(22):12920, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23124,""
"Psychological discomfort in nursing degree students as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic","Students are a population at risk of developing psychological complications, such as psychological discomfort, stress, and anxiety, among other problems, especially during the current health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The present studyâ€™s objective was to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological discomfort of final-year nursing students. A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was carried out.To analyze the psychological discomfort of the participants, the Kessler test (previously validated) was used. The results of this test were divided into two levels (High = 21/Low &lt; 21), showing high sensitivity as a screening method for anxiety and depression. Questionnaires were sent via email to final-year nursing students of Spanish and South American universities, inviting them to participate voluntarily.The sample consisted of400 students, with an average age of 23.29 years and a sex proportion of 82.75% women and 17.28% men. Almost all participants (n = 396) belonged to Spanish universities, and the greatest participation corresponded to Andalusian universities (64.5%).The average psychological discomfort was high (M = 27.94).Statistically significant relationships were detected between age, sex, and feeling ready for the world of work, observing no relationships with the rest of the studied variables. The sample of 4th-year students of the Degree of Nursing presented a high level of psychological discomfort. This pathology does not seem to be related tohaving suffered fromCOVID-19 or being in contact with infected people during the practicum and ismore strongly related to personal sociodemographic variables and students Â´ preparation for the world of work.

"A rapid realist review of effective mental health interventions for individuals with chronic physical health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic using a systems-level mental health promotion framework","The 2020 global outbreak of COVID-19 exposed and heightened threats to mental health across societies. Research has indicated that individuals with chronic physical health conditions are at high risk for suffering from severe COVID-19 illness and from the adverse consequences of public health responses to COVID-19, such as social isolation. This paper reports on the findings of a rapid realist review conducted alongside a scoping review to explore contextual factors and underlying mechanisms or drivers associated with effective mental health interventions within and across macroâ€“mesoâ€“micro systems levels for individuals with chronic physical health conditions. This rapid realist review extracted 14 qualified studies across 11 countries and identified four key mechanisms from COVID-19 literatureâ€”trust, social connectedness, accountability, and resilience. These mechanisms are discussed in relation to contextual factors and outcomes reported in the COVID literature. Realist reviews include iterative searches to refine their program theories and contextâ€“ mechanismâ€“outcome explanations. A purposive search of pre-COVID realist reviews on the study topic was undertaken, looking for evidence of the robustness of these mechanisms. There were differences in some of the pre-COVID mechanisms due to contextual factors. Importantly, an additional mechanismâ€”power-sharingâ€”was highlighted in the pre-COVID literature, but absent in the COVID literature. Pre-existing realist reviews were used to identify potential substantive theories and models associated with key mechanisms. Based on the overall findings, implications are provided for mental health promotion policy, practice, and research. Â© 2021 by the authors.

"Deep Learning-based Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling on Tourism During Covid-19 Pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the world economy and significantly influenced the tourism industry. Millions of people have shared their emotions, views, facts, and circumstances on numerous social media platforms, which has resulted in a massive flow of information. The high-density social media data has drawn many researchers to extract valuable information and understand the user's emotions during the pandemic time. The research looks at the data collected from the micro-blogging site Twitter for the tourism sector, emphasizing sub-domains hospitality and healthcare. The sentiment of approximately 20,000 tweets have been calculated using Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) model. Furthermore, topic modeling was used to reveal certain hidden themes and determine the narrative and direction of the topics related to tourism healthcare, and hospitality. Topic modeling also helped us to identify inter-cluster similar terms and analyzing the flow of information from a group of a similar opinion. Finally, a cutting-edge deep learning classification model was used with different epoch sizes of the dataset to anticipate and classify the people's feelings. The deep learning model has been tested with multiple parameters such as training set accuracy, test set accuracy, validation loss, validation accuracy, etc., and resulted in more than a 90% in training set accuracy tourism hospitality and healthcare reported 80.9 and 78.7% respectively on test set accuracy.","Mishra, R.

"Homeless people and health: vulnerability and risks during the COVID-19 pandemic Pilot study","Background: Homelessness is a complex phenomenon characterized by extreme vulnerability. The objective of the present study was to know the health status and use of the health system by homeless people (HP) in Palma de Mallorca, as well as to describe how the actual pandemic modified the needs of this population. Subjects and method: Descriptive cross-sectional study with 31 HP from Palma de Mallorca. A questionnaire that included sociodemographic profile, social support (SSQ-6), health problems, infectious diseases, mental health (PHQ-9), drug abuse (DAST-10) and basic needs (hygiene, food, safety, etc.) was administered. In addition, serology test for SARS-CoV-2, syphilis, hepatitis and HIV was performed, also their computerized medical records were reviewed. Results: The mean age was 52 +/- 8 years and 87% (27/31) were men. 48.4% had some chronic disease, 51.6% had some infectious disease and 42% had mood disorders. 96.8% of the HP used Primary Care services in 2020 versus 71% in 2019. The needs most affected by the pandemic were: hygiene (41.9%), access to public toilets (29%) and access to food (25.8%). Conclusions: HP have high rates of comorbidity. Our results suggest that the health status of HP may have worsened during the pandemic. In addition, vital needs have been affected and their vulnerability could increase.","Capitan-Moyano, L.; Bedmar, M.

"PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS DURING A PANDEMIC","Introduction: Decreased physical activity has been associated with poorer mental health and is a cause for concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To compare groups of medical students (MS) who practiced different levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the COVID-19 pandemic, in relation to symptoms of anxiety and depression (BAI-BDI), sleep quality (PSQI), and physical activity (PA) - light, moderate, vigorous (LPA-MPA and VPA), and sedentary behavior (SB). Methods: This research is a cross-sectional study involving 218 MS. Data on the characteristics of the MS were collected through online forms: PA, SB, BAI, BDI, and PSQI. The Cohen's D (Effect Size - ES) and confidence interval (95% CI), Mann-Whitney test: Lower MVPA (Median=0 minute) and Higher MVPA (Median=390 minutes) were recorded. For the statistical analyses, we used: the Odds ratio (OR) for the presence of symptoms of high levels of anxiety and depression and poor sleep quality in the MS and MVPA. Results: We found a small ES for symptoms of depression (ES 0.26 95% CI 0.00 0.53 p=0.029), and significant differences (p&lt;0.05) for symptoms of anxiety (ES 0.17 95% CI -0.09 0.44 p=0.037). There was also a significant tendency for sedentary behavior on weekdays (ES 0.27 95% CI 0.00 0.53 p = 0.051). The OR for MVPA and the presence of symptoms of high levels of anxiety was 0.407 (95% CI = 0.228 to 0.724).

"Kaleidoscope","A major concern about antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is that they increase suicidal behaviour;what are the latest findings on this? A clever aspect was a within-individual design, comparing suicide attempts a year before and a year after medication commencement in the same person to account for the confounder of â€˜selection into treatmentâ€™ (namely, those chosen for study inclusion are in parallel at greater risk of the adverse outcome of self-harm). Writing in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Watson et al3 note that insulin resistance has previously been linked to depression, but the authors take this further by exploring whether surrogate markers of this â€“ specifically, a high triglycerideâ€“HDL (high-density lipoprotein) ratio, â€˜prediabetesâ€™ (measured through fasting plasma glucose) and central obesity â€“ are associated with the subsequent development of MDD. To enhance vaccination uptake, nudging (as opposed to overt legislation or didactic teaching) has emerged as a subtle way of changing behaviour by positive reinforcement, attributed to behavioural economics and popularised by Thaler and Sunstein's 2008 book.4 However, its prima facie appeal â€“ especially relevant to the psychosocial sciences â€“ is not without criticism, not least because experimental support for some of its key wins (notably, around public health interventions for better nutrition) have been shown to be fraudulent (https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/02/07/nudgelords/).","Tracy, Derek K.; Joyce, Dan W.; Albertson, Dawn N.; Shergill, Sukhwinder S.","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2021.160","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The British Journal of Psychiatry; 219(6):701-702, 2021.; Publication details: The British Journal of Psychiatry; 219(6):701-702, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23130,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic, Personality and Geriatric Population: Proposed Pragmatism","The elderly population is a sensitive and delicate cohort of society who is being compelled to bear the significant smoulders of disruptive social behavior of humankind amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim for this review was (1) to find out the root of disruption of societal integrity and self-centeredness by analyzing the spokes of HEXACO;(2) to delineate their possible relationships with the formation of Neuroticism and eventually Psychopathy, which have endangered human civilization the most in this pandemic;and (3) to search for the potential ways to get rid of these dark times. The constellation of different negative human behaviors probably originate from the negative deflection of components of the HEXACO model of personality towards the genesis of the dark triad. COVID-19 pandemic and upsurge of the dark triad in the form of Neuroticism, Narcissism and Machiavellianism potentially portend major mental health threats. Cultivation and practice of positive emotions and triumph of honesty, humility and humanity are imperative to save the mankind from the savagery of this pandemic.

"Analysis of the Relationship among College Students' Coping Strategies, Psychological Resilience, and Anxiety during COVID-19","This study aims to use a grounded theory approach to explore the relationship among coping strategies, psychological resilience, and anxiety for college students during the COVID-19. The investigators conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with eight college students in Wuhan city who reported negative emotions, such as tension, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak. MAXQDA 2020 was used to store, transcribe, code, and analyze the data. An open coding process generalized thirty- eight concepts and nine categories such as ""self-regulation,""""threat to Survival,""and ""positive emotions.""Three core themes have emerged through axial and selective coding, and a theoretical framework was constructed. The theory that emerged from participants' experiences demonstrates that a) most college students chose positive coping strategies to relieve their anxiety, b) different causes of anxiety may lead to different types of coping strategies, and c) college students' psychological resilience is related to positive coping strategies during the COVID-19 epidemic.

"We want connection and we do not mean wi-fi: examining the impacts of Covid-19 on Gen Z's work and employment outcomes","Purpose This study aims to examine how members of Gen Z are impacted by Covid-19, specifically focusing on their professional opportunities, work preferences and future outlook. Design/methodology/approach A survey consisting of 24 questions including a Likert scale, multiple choice and open-ended was created to understand how members of Gen Z perceive Covid-19 impacting their education, employment, mental health and relationships. The survey was disseminated to employees of a corporate restaurant franchise, Christian college admissions and guidance non-profit, and online through social media including Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and LinkedIn. A total of 517 respondents completed the survey. Survey participants came from 29 states and 6 countries. Findings Results highlight Gen Z overwhelmingly values interpersonal connections, wants to Zoom less and work more in-person. The findings help anticipate potential professional gaps due to Covid-19 restrictions, as well as point out how Gen Z is markedly different in terms of workforce trends. Content analysis from an open-ended question reveals the extent of disruption Gen Z has experienced, adversely affecting their career plans and stalling professional development. Yet, despite these setbacks, Gen Z maintains a cautiously optimistic future outlook. Research limitations/implications Limitations to the study include the sample is largely comprising White women so the generalizability of results may be limited and the self-reporting nature of the survey may pose problems with method variance. Practical implications These findings have implications for Millennials as managers as they identify where resources should be invested including strengthening interpersonal communication skills, providing mentoring opportunities and appealing to their financial conservatism to recruit and retain Gen Z employees. The changes in telecommuting preferences and desire for more interpersonal and in-person communication opportunities highlight how Gen Z is markedly different than previous generations. Social implications Gen Z's optimistic future outlook conveys a sense of resilience and strength in the face of stress. Rather than engaging in cognitive distortions and over generalizations when stressed, results show Gen Z is able to find healthy alternatives and maintain optimism in the face of stress. Additionally, due to the extent of isolation and loneliness Gen Zers reported, the value of in-person connections cannot be overstated. As results convey a sense of being overlooked and missing out on so many rites of passage, inviting Gen Zers to share how they have been impacted, recognizing their accomplishments and listening to them may go a long way to develop rapport. Originality/value This study differs from others because it takes a generational look at Covid-19 impacts. The qualitative nature allows us to hear from members of Gen Z in their own words, and as a generational cohort, their voices inform workplace attitudes, practices and managerial procedures.","Becker, K.

"The Impact of Lockdowns during the Corona Pandemic on Parental Aggressiveness Behaviors","Objectives: Quarantine lockdown enforced for a long duration of time during the Corona pandemic added strain upon families;the educational system has been closed, children were forced to remain at home, and many parents lost their jobs. The aim of the study was to find out the impact of lockdown periods on middle-class parent-child relationship in terms of parental aggressive behaviors. Method: The convenient sample consisted of 236 parents to children (age ranged from 3- to 16). Recruitment was conducted through social media. Following signing a consent form, participants filled a self-report anonymous questionnaire that included demographics, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, The Conflict Tactics Scale pre and during lockdown periods, and, The Parent Strain Scale during lockdown period. Results: Findings indicated an increase of depression level among parents who had higher levels of depression pre- Corona. Additionally, secular parents younger than 36 years old, who lost their jobs, had more than two children, and, had higher levels of depression, showed increase in emotional aggressive tactics behaviors towards their children.

"Management of Placental Transfusion to Neonates After Delivery","This review summarizes high-quality evidence supporting delayed umbilical cord clamping to promote placental transfusion to preterm and term neonates. In preterm neonates, delayed cord clamping may decrease mortality and the need for blood transfusions. Although robust data are lacking to guide cord management strategies in many clinical scenarios, emerging literature is reviewed on numerous topics including delivery mode, twin gestations, maternal comorbidities (eg, gestational diabetes, red blood cell alloimmunization, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and neonatal complications (eg, fetal growth restriction, congenital heart disease, and the depressed neonate). Umbilical cord milking is an alternate method of rapid placental transfusion, but has been associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm neonates. Data on long-term outcomes are discussed, as well as potential contraindications to delayed cord clamping. Overall, delayed cord clamping offers potential benefits to the estimated 140 million neonates born globally every year, emphasizing the importance of this simple and no-cost strategy.","McAdams, Lakshminrusimha","https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004625","20211202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23141,""
"Global prevalence and associated risk factors of posttraumatic stress disorder during COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the psychological well-being of individuals and society. Previous studies conducted on coronavirus outbreaks including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome pandemic found that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety were the most common mental health problems and long-term consequences of these outbreaks. Currently, comprehensive and integrated information on the global prevalence of PTSD due to the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. In the present meta-analysis, we examined the global prevalence and associated risk factors of PTSD in patients/survivors of COVID-19, health professionals, and the population at large. Meta-analysis. Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and manual search up to June 2021. We included studies evaluating the prevalence of PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic in either patients/survivors, health professionals, and the population at large. The data were analyzed using logit transformation with the random-effects model. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using Hoy and colleagues. A total of 63 studies (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 124,952) from 24 different countries were involved. The overall pooled estimate of PTSD prevalence was 17.52% (95% CI 13.89 to 21.86), with no evidence of publication bias (t=-0.22, p-value=0.83). This study found a high prevalence of PTSD among patients with COVID-19 (15.45%; 95% CI 10.59 to 21.99), health professionals (17.23%; 95% CI 11.78 to 24.50), and the population at large (17.34%; 95% CI 12.21 to 24.03). Subgroup analyses showed that those working in COVID-19 units (30.98%; 95% CI, 16.85 to 49.86), nurses (28.22%; 95% CI, 15.83 to 45.10), those living in European countries (25.05%; 95% CI 19.14 to 32.06), and studies that used Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (30.18%, 95% CI 25.78 to 34.98) demonstrated to have the highest PTSD prevalence compared to other subgroups. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the elderly (above age 65) had lower PTSD prevalence (-1.75, 95% CI -3.16 to -0.34) than the adult population. Substantial PTSD prevalence was found in patients with COVID-19, health professionals, and the population at large. Moderator analysis revealed that age, unit of work, health profession, continent, and assessment tools as significant moderators. Mental health services are needed for everyone, especially adults under the age of 65, those who work in COVID-19 units, nurses, and people in the European continent. The study protocol was registered with the International database of prospective registered systematic reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42020218762.

"Prevalence and factors associated with anxiety and depression amongst hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Laquintinie Hospital Douala, Cameroon","Studies assessing the mental health of patients with COVID-19 infection remain limited. Disasters and major emergencies, not just COVID-19, undoubtedly lead to greater incidence of mental health problems. Previous studies indicate that the novel Coronavirus disease can cause panic and stress in patients. Our literature search didn't reveal any previous published data from Cameroon and the Central African sub-region. In order to bridge this gap, we assessed the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. We carried out a cross-sectional study in a secondary hospital in the Littoral Region of Cameroon. We recruited hospitalised COVID-19 patients during a 4-month period. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics. The HADS score was used to assess levels of anxiety and depression. All analysis were done using Stata 14. A P value of &lt;0.05 was used as the cut-off for statistical significance. A total number of 285 patients took part in this study with a mean age of 48.47 years. The prevalence of anxiety in COVID-19 patients was 60.35% while the prevalence of depression was 81.40%. At multivariate logistic regression male gender (OR: 1.89, P = 0.04), hypoxaemia (OR: 2.20, P = 0.01), presence of COVID-19 complications (OR: 1.61, P = 0.02) and current episode of depression (OR: 4.14, P&lt;0.01) were independently associated with anxiety. Similarly, age &gt; 35 years (OR:2.03, P = 0.02), presence of comorbidity (OR: 1.68, P = 0.01), BMI &gt; = 30kg/m2 (OR: 1.78, P = 0.02), presence of COVID-19 complications (OR: 1.28, P = 0.01) and anxiety (OR: 4.60, P&lt;0.001) were independently associated with depression.

"Common Mental Disorders and Economic Uncertainty: Evidence from the COVID-19 PandemicÃ‚Â in the US","Mental health disorders represent an enormous cost to society, are related to economic outcomes, and have increased markedly since the COVID-19 outbreak. Economic activity contracted dramatically on a global scale in 2020, representing the worst crisis since the Great Depression. This study used the COVID Impact Survey to provide insights on the interactions of mental illness and economic uncertainty during COVID-19. We used a probability-based panel survey, COVID Impact Survey, conducted in the U.S. over three waves in the period April-June 2020. The survey covered individual information on employment, economic and financial uncertainty, mental and physical health, as well as other demographic information. The prevalence of moderate mental distress was measured using a Psychological Distress Scale, a 5-item scale that is scored on a 4-point scale (total range: 0-15). The mental distress effect of employment, economic, and financial uncertainty, was assessed in a logit regression analysis conditioning for demographic and health information. It is found that employment, health coverage, social security, and food provision uncertainty are additional stressors for mental health. These economic factors work in addition to demographic effects, where groups who display increased risk for psychological distress include: women, Hispanics, and those in poor physical health. A decrease in employment and increases in economic uncertainty are associated with a doubling of common mental disorders. The population-representative survey evidence presented strongly suggests that economic policies which support employment (e.g., job keeping, job search support, stimulus spending) provide not only economic security but also constitute a major health intervention. Moving forward, the economic uncertainty effect ought to be reflected in community level intervention and prevention efforts, which should include strengthening economic support to reduce financial and economic strain.","Tham, Sojli, Bryant, McAleer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260726","20211202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23146,""

"Considering Ecological Determinants of Youth Mental Health in the Era of COVID-19 and the Anthropocene: A Call to Action from Young Public Health Professionals","In 2019, young Australians reported that two of their top concerns were 'climate change and the environment' and 'mental health'. The events of 2020/2021, such as the ongoing climate emergency, the Australian bushfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect the human-induced environmental issues young people are most worried about and have also exacerbated the mental health issues which they already reported to be at a crisis point back in 2019. Given experiences of mental illness in adolescence are associated with poorer mental health across the lifespan, it is becoming increasingly important to address ecological determinants of youth mental health in the Anthropocene. However, despite the inclusion of ecological determinants of health in seminal health promotion frameworks, health promotion has been described as 'ecologically blind', emphasising social determinants of health at the expense of ecological determinants of health. A socio-ecological model, which equally considers upstream social and ecological factors, should be applied to youth mental health issues. Using the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, we demonstrate how the ecological determinants of health may be incorporated into health promotion approaches targeting youth mental health. We also call for the health promotion sector to consider a number of actions to work towards achieving a transition to ecological determinants of health being at the forefront of health promotion activities. This commentary, written by young public health professionals, hopes to build on the momentum garnered by youth activists around the world and bring attention to the importance of ecological determinants of health for youth mental health promotion in the era of COVID-19 and the Anthropocene.","Oswald, Langmaid","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.560","20211202","Ecological Determinants of Health; Health Promotion; Healthy Environments; Mental Health; Ottawa Charter; Social Determinants; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23150,""
"Impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on the health and psychosocial well-being of MÃ„Âori, Pacific Peoples and New Zealand Europeans living in aged residential care","To investigate the impact of New Zealand's (NZ) first wave of COVID-19, which included a nationwide lockdown, on the health and psychosocial well-being of MÃ„Âori, Pacific Peoples and NZ Europeans in aged residential care (ARC). interRAI assessments of MÃ„Âori, Pacific Peoples and NZ Europeans (aged 60Ã‚Â years and older) completed between 21/3/2020 and 8/6/2020 were compared with assessments of the same ethnicities during the same period in the previous year (21/3/2019 to 8/6/2019).

"A Potential Paradigm Shift in Opioid Crisis Management: The Role of Pharmacogenomics","Pharmacogenetic investigations into the opioid crisis suggest genetic variation could be a significant cause of opioid- related morbidity and mortality. Variability in opioid system genes, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, manifest after pharmacogenetic testing, as previously invisible risk factors for addiction and overdose. Pharmacodynamic genes regulate opioid-sensitive brain networks and neural reward circuitry. Pharmacokinetic genes expressed in drug metabolic pathways regulate blood levels of active versus inactive opioid metabolites. Elucidating the complex interplay of genetic variations in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways will shed new light on the addictive and toxic properties of opioids. This narrative review serves to promote understanding of key genetic mechanisms affecting the metabolism and actions of opioids, and to explore causes of the recent surge in opioid-related mortality associated with COVID-19.

From before to during the pandemic, anxiety symptoms increased (worsened) (from 6.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.7 to 7.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.6; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), depressive symptoms increased (worsened) (from 5.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.0 to 8.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.5; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and SRH decreased (worsened) (from 3.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2 to 2.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The total effect of worsening anxiety symptoms on worsening SRH (-0.043; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) occurs entirely because of worsening depressive symptoms, i.e. the direct effect was statistically non-significant -0.030 (<i>p</i> = 0.068). Older incarcerated persons experienced worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic which was associated with worsening SRH. These findings have implications for health-care costs and services needed to care for this vulnerable group. This is the first study to evaluate change in older incarcerated persons' mental health from before the COVID-19 pandemic to during the pandemic.","DePalma, Noujaim, Coman, Wakefield, Barry","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPH-08-2021-0077","20211202","COVID-19; Elderly prisoners; Health in prison; Incarceration; Mental health; Mental illness; Offender health; Older prisoners; Prisoners; Self-rated health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23156,""
"Psychiatric inpatients' views of their mental health, and their experience of social change, during the pandemic: A report from Qatar","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people under the care of mental health services has received relatively little attention in the scientific literature. To assess psychiatric inpatients' views regarding their mental health and experience of social change during the pandemic. Cross-sectional survey of consecutive patients admitted to Qatar's only psychiatric hospital between mid-June and mid-October 2020. Data was analysed for 114/284 (40%) patients admitted during the study period. 8 (7%) reported a history of COVID-19. 43% reported that the pandemic had led to deterioration in their mental health, 11% to an improvement and 39% that there had been no attributable change. Those reporting worsened mental health, attributable to the pandemic, were significantly more likely to report having experienced four negative social changes during the pandemic, namely reduced ability to discuss emotions/feelings with family members, decreased time spent exercising, decreased time spent relaxing and increased stress from the home. Demographic factors did not distinguish those reporting worsened mental health from those whose mental health was improved or unchanged. A large proportion of psychiatric inpatients reported negative social and mental health changes during the pandemic. However, the study cannot determine causality. Mental health services should consider the psychological and social aspects of people's lives, including their interactions with family, friends and the community. This is especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its wide impact on society. Interventions for people diagnosed with mental health disorders should address their psychological and social needs.","Badanapurkar, Nelson, Alabdulla, Reagu, Woodruff, Varghese, Aly, Haddad","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12810","20211202","COVID-19; Inpatients; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23157,""
"A Medical Student Postpartum Telehealth Initiative During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our health systems and delivery of care and on the disruption of medical education. It has forced hospitals to move to a telehealth model for prenatal and postpartum visits and expedite discharges for postpartum patients in order to reduce exposure. We describe our medical school and hospital system initiative to employ medical student volunteers for postpartum telehealth calls during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Ten medical students conducted phone interviews with postpartum patients within 72Ã‚Â h of discharge at three hospitals in a large NYC health system, with faculty preceptors at each site who provided daily call assignments and oversight. Students called patients to screen for risk factors for postpartum complications, including preeclampsia and postpartum depression; provide additional contraception counseling; and address newborn care and health. One week and 2Ã‚Â week post-discharge calls were also made for COVID-19 positive patients for ongoing symptom monitoring and counseling. We found numerous opportunities for intervention in postpartum health via telehealth, including addressing pharmacy-related needs, patient counseling, improving pain management, and identifying patients in need of emergent re-evaluation. As this pandemic continues to evolve, our model demonstrates the feasibility of telehealth and medical student involvement in postpartum care and its benefits to patients, medical student learning, and alleviation of burden on obstetric staff.","Wang, Gellman, Wood, Garvey, Connolly, Barazani, Pruzan, Abraham","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03314-0","20211202","COVID-19; Medical student education; Postpartum care; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23158,""
"Research on the frequency of post-traumatic stress disorder in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","It is highly probable that the COVID-19 outbreak, one of the most severe pandemics to which humanity has been exposed, will promote post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a serious mental illness that decreases quality of life and functionality of healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to research the frequency of PTSD in HCWs who are working in a central pandemic hospital, during the COVID-19 outbreak. In total, 300 HCWs were included in the study. Diagnosis of PTSD was made according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, and the severity of PTSD symptoms was evaluated using the PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version Scale. In total, 21.6% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°65) of the HCWs were diagnosed with PTSD, 18.3% of them were female (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°55) and 3.3% were male (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) participants. The mean PCL-C score of participants diagnosed with PTSD was found to be 60.38Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.81. No statistically significant difference was found between profession groups diagnosed with PTSD. HCWs who are working directly with COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of PTSD. PTSD can lead to severe negative consequences such as lower quality of life and loss of workforce and productivity, if it is not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, it should become a routine to continuously monitor and establish early targeted mental health interventions.","Korkut","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02871-1","20211202","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23159,""
"How COVID-19 induced panic on stock price and green finance markets: global economic recovery nexus from volatility dynamics","This paper investigates the effect of different categories of essential COVID-19 data from 2020 to 2021 towards stock price dynamics and options markets. It applied the hypothetical method in which investors develop depression based on the understanding suggested by various green finance divisions. Furthermore, additional elements like panic, sentiment, and social networking sites may impact the attitude, size, and direction of green finance, subsequently impacting the security prices. We created new emotion proxies based on five groups of information, namely COVID-19, marketplace, lockdown, banking sector, and government relief using Google search data. The results show that (1) if the proportional number of traders' conduct exceeds the stock market, the effect of sentimentality indexes on jump volatility is expected to change; (2) the volatility index component jump radically increases with the COVID-19 index, city and market lockdown index, and banking index; and (3) expanding the COVID-19 index gives rise to the stock market index. Moreover, all indexes decreased in jump volatility but only after 5Ã‚Â days. These findings comply with the hypotheses proposed by our model.","Tan, Sadiq, Aldeehani, Ehsanullah, Mutira, Vu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17774-y","20211202","COVID-19; Government relief; Green finance; Market lockdown; Responsible Editor: Nicholas Apergis; Stock price","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23160,""
"ST Depression in the Setting of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage","We present a case report of a patient presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage whose electrocardiogram (ECG) mimicked non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A 36-year-old male with a past medical history of resistant hypertension, previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and alcohol abuse presented to the hospital after cardiac arrest. He was taken to the catheterization lab upon arrival and was found to have an unremarkable coronary angiogram. After angiography, computerized tomography (CT) head was performed revealing an acute, large-volume, subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subsequent CT angiogram of the head confirmed this with source noted to be a ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. ST depression on ECGÃ‚Â has been reported in patients who have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although the most common etiology of cardiac arrest is an acute coronary syndrome, other etiologies based on a patient's past medical history need to remain in the differential. Recognition of ECG changes may lead to earlier diagnosis and decreased mortality in subarachnoid patients.","Mustafa, Hitt, Smirlis, Koranne","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.19030","20211202","12-lead ecg; angiogram; covid 19; st depression; subarachnoid hemmorhage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23161,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on cancer management in military hospitals of Saudi Arabia","To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on cancer management in Saudi Arabia's military hospitals. This multi-centric, retrospective study compared cancer patients diagnosed from February-July 2019 and 2020, focusing on the time duration for acceptance and time for oncologic treatment initiation. Eligibility and referral status were recorded. Clinical data of COVID-19-positive cancer patients were collected and evaluated their outcomes and survival. Data of 1574 cancer patients (mean age, 57.1 years) were collected. Mean time for acceptance was 7.3 days in 2019 and 8 days in 2020, with no statistically significant difference. Mean time for oncology treatment initiation was 38.4 days in 2019 and 44.3 days in 2020, with no statistically significant difference. The number of new cancer patients decreased in 2020 but increased in peripheral hospitals. It decreased in Riyadh and Jeddah hospitals. Concerning referral status, a statistically significant modification was recorded only in Riyadh and Tabuk hospitals. No significant changes observed in time duration for acceptance of new patients and oncology treatment initiation from 2019-2020. A total of 76 COVID-19-positive cancer patients recorded; 72% were symptomatic, 73.6% recovered, 22.3% died due to COVID-19 complications, and 8% died due to cancer; cancer progressed in 7 patients. COVID-19 did not affect oncology service in Saudi Arabia's military hospitals. New cancer cases reduced during the pandemic.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of nursing students in Japan: protocol for a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading globally with a high risk of mortality. It is also significantly affecting mental health. For nursing students, the impact of COVID-19 on mental health is predicted to be significant; however, sufficient data have not been obtained. Therefore, this study will aim to assess the mental health of nursing students and evaluate the related factors. This proposed study is a cross-sectional survey using a self-report questionnaire. An online questionnaire will be distributed among all nursing students of eight universities in Japan. The survey questionnaire will consist of questions related to demography, life satisfaction, fear of COVID-19, mental health and physical activities. The target sample size is 1300 nursing students. We will calculate descriptive statistics for each measurement item and perform univariate and logistic regression analyses to evaluate the potential risk factors for anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms in nursing students. The strength of association will be assessed using the OR and its 95% CIs. Statistical significance will be set at a p&lt;0.05. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Hyogo on 22 March 2021 (ID: 2020F29). In addition, all of the participating facilities required ethical approval from their local IRBs. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. We believe that the proposed large-scale investigation of the mental health of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationship between mental health and fear of COVID-19 are novel and will be a strength of this study.","Kako, Ito, Kajiwara, Kimura, Kakeda, Hamanishi, Sasaki, Yamanaka, Kiyohara, Wakiguchi, Endo, Harada, Koga, Ishida, Nishida, Kobayashi, Tsubaki","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055916","20211202","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; insomnia; nursing student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23164,""
"Mental burden and perception of the study situation among undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study and comparison of dental and medical students","To investigate levels of distress, depression, anxiety, stress and perception of their current study situation during the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduate dental and medical students. Observational, cross-sectional study including two consecutive surveys (May and July 2020). A large medical school in Germany. All first year dental and medical students were invited. 132 participating first year students (44 dental, 88 medical) from the first survey and 150 students (50 dental, 100 medical) from the second were included in our analyses. Mental burden (distress thermometer, Patient Health Questionnaire-4, Perceived Stress Scale-4) and self-reported changes in mental health and perception of study situation during the COVID-19 pandemic (self-developed items) were compared. Open-ended questions were analysed by conventional content analyses. A considerable proportion of students (t1: May 2020: 84.1%; t2: July 2020: 77.3%) reported distress levels above cut-off. In July 2020, dental students reported significantly higher distress scores than medical students (dental: M=7.0, SD=2.3; medical: M=5.7; SD=2.1; p&lt;0.001). More dental than medical students reported mild, moderate and severe levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. The majority stated that their mental health and study motivation had not changed during the pandemic. Logistic regression showed that being a dental student was significantly associated with a higher likelihood for serious worries regarding the study situation during COVID-19 at t1 (OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.1 to 14.2). At t2 higher distress was significantly associated with a higher likelihood for experiencing serious worries (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5). Regarding current concerns related to the pandemic, students most frequently reported difficulties with self-regulated learning (15.2%), study-related worries and uncertainty (14.4%), missing feedback of students and lecturers (11.4%) and lack of practical training (9.8%). The results suggest that high mental burden and the lack of practical training among medical and dental students is an increasing problem, with a possibly even higher urgency in dental students. Tailored psychological and educational support offers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic might help them as they progress through (medical and) dental school.","Guse, Weegen, Heinen, Bergelt","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054728","20211202","COVID-19; medical education &amp; training; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-03","",23165,""
"A collaborative and evolving response to the needs of frontline workers, patients and families during the COVID-19 pandemic at Tygerberg Hospital, Western Cape Province, South Africa","The global devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its mental health impact is undeniable. The physical and psychologicalÃ‚Â consequences are wide-ranging - affecting patients fighting the disease, frontline workers in the trenches with them, healthcare staffÃ‚Â deployed in high-care settings, and families disconnected from their loved ones in their darkest hours. Within 6 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa, the Department of Psychiatry at Stellenbosch University established the TBH/SU COVID Resiliency ClinicÃ‚Â to provide psychological support to frontline workers at Tygerberg Hospital. Identified barriers in healthcare workers accessing mentalÃ‚Â healthcare resulted in moving towards an on-site visibility to try to remove some of these barriers. This greater on-site presence enabledÃ‚Â networking and building of relationships with frontline staff that over time highlighted other frontline needs, such as providing psychosocialÃ‚Â and spiritual support to patients and their families. We share challenges, lessons learned and recommendations from two initiatives: theÃ‚Â TBH/SU COVID-19 Resiliency Clinic, and an embedded COVID Care Team (CCT).
