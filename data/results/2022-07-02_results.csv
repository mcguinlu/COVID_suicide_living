"Chronic fatigue, depression and anxiety symptoms in Long COVID are strongly predicted by neuroimmune and neuro-oxidative pathways which are caused by the inflammation during acute infection","BackgroundLong-term coronavirus disease 2019 (Long COVID) is associated with physio-somatic (chronic fatigue syndrome and somatic symptoms) and affective (depression and anxiety) symptoms. The severity of the Long COVID physio-affective phenome is largely predicted by peak body temperature (BT) and lowered oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the acute infectious phase. This study aims to delineate whether the association of BT and SpO2 during the acute phase and the Long COVID physio-affective phenome is mediated by neurotoxicity (NT) resulting from activated immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways.

MethodsWe recruited 86 patients with Long COVID (3-4 months after the acute phase) and 39 healthy controls and assessed serum C-reactive protein (CRP), caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1{beta}, IL-18, IL-10, myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and calcium (Ca), as well as peak BT and SpO2 during the acute phase.

ResultsCluster analysis revealed that a significant part (34.9%) of Long COVID patients (n=30) show a highly elevated NT index computed based on IL-1{beta}, IL-18, Caspase-1, CRP, MPO and AOPP. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 61.6% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID is explained by the NT index, lowered Ca, peak BT/SpO2 in the acute phase, and prior vaccinations with Astra-Zeneca or Pfizer. The most important predictors of the physio-affective phenome are Ca, CRP, IL-1{beta}, AOPP and MPO.

ConclusionThe infectious-immune-inflammatory core of acute COVID-19 strongly predicts the development of physio-affective symptoms 3-4 months later, and these effects are partly mediated by neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways.","Hussein Kadhem Al-Hakeim; Haneen Tahseen Al-Rubaye; Abbas F.

The results indicate that these representations vary and are associated with the media channel and the effect the reception produces on mood and mental health. A total of 80 interviews and 1,068 online survey forms were applied in different regions of Colombia. The qualitative phase showed that the programs or messages received were represented positively when they came from audiovisual entertainment and contributed to the family unit and reduced stress during the lockdown. Meanwhile, media reception was represented negatively when the messages or news came from journalism or social networks and increased the misinformation, anxiety, and fear of contagion. The quantitative phase found that media reception decreased as the lockdown continued, due to information saturation and the proliferation of news emphasizing the risks of COVID-19.

"HERBAL RESOURCES IN THE MEDICATION OF DEPRESSION DURING PANDEMIC COVID-19","Depression has long been recognized as a major public health problem. Fear and anxiety associated with the high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 have increased risk factors for mental health decline. A high prevalence of psychiatric disorders has been documented in individuals who have been directly or indirectly exposed to life-threatening situations. Current evidence suggests decompensation of pre-existing psychiatric disorders, increasing levels of depression, anxiety, and worry, and increased suicide as sequelae of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are particularly vulnerable because psychopathologies can be exacerbated by coronaviruses, either through direct viral infection of the central nervous system or indirectly through an immune response. It, therefore, seems expedient to search for alternative methods of prevention, treatment, or supportive treatment of depression, especially since conventional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are only partially effective. Beneficial antidepressant effects have been observed after the application of spice plants as well as some mushrooms and herbs containing complex active components or phytochemicals.

"Rieaya: New Mobile Application for the Elderly Care Services at Home during the Covid19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia","The number of elderly people (65 years and over) is constantly increasing in the world. It is expected to exceed one billion by 2050. Due to this augmentation, issues related to the elderly (e.g., social isolation, loneliness, malnutrition, the difficulty of performing daily tasks forgetfulness, depression, etc.) have been given great attention in the last decades. With the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the situation of elderly people has worsened in all countries. These persons become more exposed to the risk of suffering from severe illness if attacked by the virus. In this context and to limit the spread of the CORONA virus and protect this class of people from the bad effects of this new disease, Saudi Arabia took many measures and restrictions. We introduce, in the present work a healthcare application implemented in smartphones. This application uses a platform to provide digital solutions to help the elderly overcome social isolation, malnutrition and loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic. We also develop a suitable action plan for the disabled elderly to perform their daily tasks such as medication appointments and psychological counseling.","Alzuwaid, M.; Brahim, H.","https://doi.org/10.22937/ijcsns.2022.22.4.77","","Database: English Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security; 22(4):663-670, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33583,""
"Knowledge, Attitude, Perception and Psychological Status of Healthcare Workers During CoviD-19 outbreak in Libya: A Cross Sectional Study","Healthcare professionals, especially those who work in hospitals that treat patients with Coronavirus infection (CoviD-19), are at a higher risk of contracting this disease than workers in other departments. Healthcare workers are under a lot of stress as they fight the CoviD-19 outbreak, which increases their risk of developing psychological difficulties. As a result, ill-prepared healthcare workers can lead to delayed diagnosis, disease spread, and poor infection control. An evaluation of Knowledge, Attitudes, Perceptions, and Psychological Effects in light of the CoviD-19 pandemic in Libya may indicate effective strategies for behavioral change in a given society and may assess the psychological state of healthcare workers during that crisis. At present, Libyan healthcare workers are not well aware of the risks. Healthcare workers participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey during the CoviD-19 pandemic in 2020. The KAP questions are imported from Egyptian study and the psychological impact questions are imported from Chinese study that used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and insomnia Severity index. Questions are adapted to be suitable for the Libyan context. The Knowledge, attitude and perception were analyzed using a total score based on Bloom's 80% cut-off. According to our results, in total, we received 85.4% high knowledge score of Libyan HCWs in regards to CoviD-19. About 54.6% participants showed negative attitude towards CoviD-19 infection and the precautionary measures taken to prevent its spread. The majority of respondents, 89.1%, felt that they were vulnerable to CoviD-19 infection. 85.4% believed they were more likely than others to become infected. Fear of transmission to family members, having chronic illnesses, and community stigma are the most frequently reported reasons for higher risk perceptions. in general, HCWs had a good understanding of CoviD-19. Negative attitudes are evident in the observations a high level of risk perception was evident. it is vital that the Libyan Ministry of Health and government consider the reasons for increased risk perception. Healthcare workers, specifically those who are responding to CoviD-19 in Libya, experienced an increase in anxiety, depression and insomnia, which were respectively 30.1%, 31.9% and 18.9%. in this study, many Healthcare workers reported adequate overall knowledge with a negative attitude toward government and adopted appropriate practices. Psychological problems are directly related to inadequate knowledge, incorrect attitudes, and inadequate perception. However, with timely interventions and correct information, it will be possible to protect the mental wellbeing of healthcare professionals during the novel coronavirus epidemic.","Ahmed Lagaa, M.

"Clinical profile and Prevalence of poisoning patients presenting to the emergency department of a teaching hospital in Kerala: A retrospective comparative study before and during COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Emergency physicians must be updated about the variations in poisoning pattern during Covid19 pandemic. Limited data exist on the incidence and characteristics of patients presenting with poisoning in Indian Emergency Departments (ED) during the COVID 19 pandemic. Hence, we aimed to explore the impact of Covid19 pandemic on poisoning cases presenting to the ED. Methods: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted on poisoning patients presenting to ED during the pandemic period (April 1-October 30, 2020 (period 2)), and a matching period before the pandemic (September 1,2019 to March 31, 2020 (period 1)). The rate of prevalence and clinical profile were compared between period 1 and 2 using appropriate statistical test. Results: A total of 111 (periods 1 = 57, and periods 2 = 54) cases were analysed. Poisoning prevalence rates had slightly increased by 2.7% before the pandemic (51.33%) in comparison to during the pandemic (48.6%) period (p=0.3). Females were predominant in both periods, and the mean age of 32.5 years. The predominant (57%) patient age group was 15-34 years. 36.9% (n=41) patients consumed multiple poisons, 19.8% (n=22) consumed paracetamol, and 14.4% (n=16) patients consumed psychiatric medications. Before lockdown, 27.02% (n=30) patients presented within 3 hours ingestion, and 21.6% (n=24) presented after 3 hours ingestion (p=0.12). A significant delay in arrival of poisoning cases during lockdown (p= 0.12) with increased hospital admission (p=0.03) was observed. A psychiatric disorder was observed in 36.03% cases. Majority of the cases were admitted in the ICU, and 0.9%(n=1) death was recorded. Conclusions: This is the first Indian study that describes the incidence of poisoning cases and their pattern during the COVID 19pandemic period, study revealed that increased mental health crisis in low resource settings in rural Kerala affects predominantly young population. Study implies the importance of priming the mental health care professionals to initiate their mental health screening programmes.","Linu, S. M.; Manojan, K. K.; Muthuraman, K.

"Automatic Classification and Identification of Road Garbage Images and Evaluation of Environmental Health Based on UNet plus","As Covid-19 plagues the world, a clean environment helps to control the factors and risks that threaten health, and curb the spread of the epidemic. However, the quality evaluation of environmental health faces some problems and challenges in actual management and practice. Firstly, the classification, identification, and quantification of road garbage are mainly done manually, because of the diversity of road garbage, as well as their sharp differences in geometry, color, and texture. Secondly, it is labor-intensive to manually manage the large operation areas on the wide urban roads. Thirdly, the accuracy of statistical indices is affected by the time-varying road environment, making the quality evaluation of environmental health untimely and inaccurate. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent image classification and evaluation method for urban environmental health. Specifically, an environmental garbage recognition and semantic segmentation approach was designed based on UNet++, and combined with the vehicle-mounted machine vision system to automatically identify the typical targets among the road waste control indices. Next, an image attention quantitative evaluation method was developed based on the eye tracking analyzer, and the quantified attention was fused with the statistical features for road garbage classification, forming an attention-based evaluation method for environmental quality. The proposed approach supports the automatic recognition and semantic segmentation of the garbage on urban roads, and realizes the identification of complex targets in different scenes through transfer learning. In addition, the attention-based evaluation method for environmental quality provides environmental management departments with visual basis for quantitative decision-making.","Chen, W.; Zheng, X.; Zhou, H.

"Assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism workers' health and well-being in Jordan","The current study assesses the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on tourism workers' health and well-being in Jordan by investigating coronavirus threats, financial impacts, resources impacts, social isolation, depression and personal control experienced by tourism workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how the threats and impacts of the coronavirus pandemic affect workers' health and well-being. A quantitative survey method was applied using a questionnaire. Data were collected from a sample of 400 tourism workers in Jordan. The study's findings revealed that tourism workers are financially strained, socially isolated, psychologically depressed, experiencing a lack of personal control, and have limited resources due to their dread of the pandemic and its negative impacts. It was also found that a significant negative direct effect of perceived coronavirus threats and their impacts on workers' depression and personal control had a significant influence on workers' health and well-being. The current study proposed a model of the influence of coronavirus on tourism workers' health and well-being through their personal control and depression.","Al-Ababneh, M. M.; Al-Shakhsheer, F.

"Differential Impacts of COVID-19 on College Student Tourism Jobs: Insights from Vacationland-Maine, USA","The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected all sectors including educational institutions transitioning from face-to-face to hybrid and virtual classes. Partial or full closure of tourism businesses has impacted college students' jobs within the college and/or outside in the business sector. For a tourism dependent economy such as Maine's, the impacts of COVID-19 have been severe, including lost job opportunities for students. Several studies have researched the impacts of COVID-19 on the physical, psychological, social, and mental health status of college students;however, few have addressed the impacts on college students' jobs. Thus, the purpose of this study is to understand how students at the University of Southern Maine (USM) have been impacted in their jobs by COVID-19 and to consider what stakeholders can do to support and rebuild the workforce. A quantitative survey was distributed to all USM undergraduate students (completed by 160) between 26 April through 6 May 2021. The study found that pre-COVID, 44% of student employment was in non-tourism, 25% in tourism, and 16% in USM work study, while 15% were unemployed. At the time of the survey, those proportions had shifted to 42% in non-tourism, 22% in tourism, 14% in USM work study, and 22% not employed with a significant increase in the non-employed student category. The study found that, initially, COVID-19 had impacted student employment in terms of changed responsibilities, reduced hours, job layoffs/losses, increased hours, and voluntary job loss. Students' current jobs (during the survey) were impacted in the form of changed responsibilities/jobs/locations and industries, including decreased hours. During the pandemic, students valued industry support such as enhanced cleaning/safety, flexible hours/time off, work from home, as well as academic support in terms of flexibility, emotional support, industry updates, and networking opportunities. The study recommends that stakeholders develop collaborative comprehensive emergency management plans (CEMPs) to mitigate disruptions such as COVID-19 and be prepared for future disasters of this nature.","Dangi, Tek B.; Michaud, Tracy, Dumont, Robyn, Wheeler, Tara","https://doi.org/10.3390/tourhosp3020032","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Tourism and Hospitality; 3(2):509-535, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33594,""

Material and Methods: In total, 130 patients from four Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease Units of the National Health System of Greece Hospitals were examined via an anonymous questionnaire developed and distributed through stratified sampling. Results: Transfusion-dependent thalassemia, transfused sickle cell disease, and other hemoglobinopathies were represented by 130 patients. During the pandemic, the main concern of patients was the affordability of blood for transfusion. During the lockdown, patients' moods varied, and their daily lives were disrupted by a lack of access to basic goods and communication with friends and family. Their eating habits, access to exercise, and, to a lesser extent, their financial situation have all been affected in their daily lives.

"Relationship between Psychological Distress, Basic Psychological Needs, Anxiety, Mental Pressure, and Athletic Burnout of Chinese College Football Athletes during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 poses a significant threat to mental health, which may lead to psychological stress in a number of individuals. Athlete burnout is a common psychological phenomenon that has a negative influence on their sports career. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between psychological distress and athletic burnout among Chinese college football athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the mediating role of basic psychological needs, anxiety and mental pressure. In an online cross-sectional survey conducted in February 2022, the team coaches sent an electronic questionnaire to college football athletes. Participants completed questionnaires on relevant variables. Pearson correlation analysis and mediation effect analysis were carried out by using SPSS software and its plug-in process V3.3. The study included 672 participants and the results showed that: (1) psychological distress, basic psychological needs, anxiety, mental pressure and athletic burnout were significantly pairwise correlated, (2) mental pressure, anxiety and basic psychological needs play a mediating role between psychological distress and athletic burnout respectively, and (3) basic psychological needs and anxiety, basic psychological needs and mental pressure, anxiety and mental pressure, as well as mental pressure, anxiety and basic psychological needs respectively play a chain mediating role between psychological distress and athletic burnout. In conclusion, psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic is an important factor leading to athletic burnout among Chinese college football athletes and may further affect the level of athletic burnout through basic psychological needs, anxiety and mental pressure. The government and schools should strengthen the recognition of these factors in order to improve the situation of athletic burnout among Chinese college football athletes.","Liu, Minhang, Zhao, Xiuhan, Liu, Zongyu","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14127100","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(12):7100, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33596,""
"Demonic and Divine Attributions around COVID-19 Vaccines: Links with Vaccine Attitudes and Behaviors, QAnon and Conspiracy Beliefs, Anger, Spiritual Struggles, Religious and Political Variables, and Supernatural and Apocalyptic Beliefs","Given the prevalence of supernatural beliefs in the United States, some people may believe that God or the devil influenced people to create or receive COVID-19 vaccines. In an Internet sample of 3196 U.S. adults (with many preregistered hypotheses), divine vaccine attributions were more common than demonic attributions. Demonic vaccine attributions were linked with more anti-vaccination attitudes and lower odds of vaccination, whereas divine attributions showed the opposite pattern. Demonic (but not divine) attributions showed consistent positive connections with conspiracy beliefs (including QAnon), anger toward people and organizations seen as pro-vaccine, and seeing one's political opponents as enemies and as evil. Demonic attributions were also linked with more anxiety, depression, and spiritual struggle, and lower agreeableness and social desirability. Both demonic and divine attributions related positively to political conservatism, religious fundamentalism, Christian nationalism, authoritarian aggression, and traditional masculinity beliefs. Demonic (but not divine) attributions were also associated with being younger and having less education. Both demonic and divine vaccine attributions correlated positively with religiousness, belief in God and the devil, and seeing these entities as powerful, able to work through natural events, and intervening often in the world. Demonic and divine attributions also related positively to belief in heaven and hell, seeing many people as destined for hell, seeing life as a cosmic battle between good and evil, and apocalyptic or 'end times';beliefs.","Exline, Julie J.; Pait, Kathleen C.; Wilt, Joshua A.; Schutt, William A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13060519","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(6):519, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33597,""
"Model for Health Risk Assessment in Portuguese Housing Spaces","Currently, people spend most of their time inside their homes. However, poor conditions in terms of comfort and quality of the indoor environment can pose high risks to the inhabitants' health. Therefore, a good quality environment is essential, since, in addition to the hazards present in indoor air (e.g., particles, (S)VOCs, CO, radon and tobacco smoke), extreme temperatures, relative humidity levels, pests (e.g., mold, dust mites and bioaerosols), noise, airborne infectious agents (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and contamination through water and soil can cause physical injuries, respiratory diseases, damage to multiple organ systems as well as harmful effects on the mental health of the occupants. Faced with this requirement, housing evaluation models were studied together with the main types of risk that could affect the health of the inhabitants, with the objective of proposing a new evaluation model for housing health and safety risks, fitted to the occupants, and especially suitable for Portuguese dwellings, although applicable in other geographical contexts. As a result of this analysis, this article proposes a new model for evaluating health and safety risks in housing, applicable in Portugal, supported by an inspection form and, as the main difference from the existing models, parameter measurements, providing complementary data for the evaluation. This model was created based on a set of functional and regulatory requirements that were identified for the healthy use of living spaces. Twenty-eight hazards were identified, and the respective risk factors were assessed using different processes and target demographics, including visual inspection, parameter measurements, occupants' age and location and age of housing. In order to validate the model and determine its usefulness, it was applied to a set of houses with different construction dates, locations and occupants. This exercise enabled the identification of hazard classes and the calibration and fine tuning of the model application. Finally, proposals for future work are presented in order to create a base of evolution for the model.","Pinto, Manuel, Pastorinho, M.

"Dependence of Socio-Emotional Competence Expression on Gender and Grade for K5-K12 Students","Socio-emotional education is referred to as the missing part that links academic knowledge to successes in school, family, community, workplace, and life. Socio-emotional education, in conjunction with academic instruction, aims to lay the groundwork for a sound moral education. This manuscript is aimed at proving that socio-emotional education may improve children's mental health. In total, 1322 students (of grades K5-K12) participated in this study back in October 2020. A statistically validated and partially modified questionnaire according to The Limbic Performance Indicators (TM) (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92, p &lt; 0.000) was used to assess general education school students' social-emotional competencies. The study uses an abbreviated version of the questionnaire adapted by the Lithuanian Association of Social Emotional Education, which has been adapted with the consent of the selected age group. As a result, this study explores how to determine general education school students' knowledge and skills in socio-emotional education while also identifying the best pedagogical approaches to addressing socio-emotional education. According to research findings, students that participated in the study displayed more personal values, respect for others, internal balance, collaboration, emotional perception of others, or basic emotional needs. Personal values, respect for others, emotional perception of others, internal balance, support, and basic emotional needs were estimated to be greater in the target group of girls than in the target group of boys.","Butvilas, T.; Bubnys, R.; Colomer, J.; Canabate, D.","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12050341","","Database: English Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(5):13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33599,""
"Contesting Deaths' Despair: Local Public Religion, Radical Welcome and Community Health in the Overdose Crisis, Massachusetts, USA","In the United States, the first decades of the twenty-first century have been marked by a worsening fatal drug overdose epidemic leading life expectancy to decline for the first time in a century. Often termed deaths of despair, this development is attributed to declines in civic life, including lessening religious participation, wrought by long-term deindustrialization. Despite this, civil society has responded by contesting despair and the conditions hastening fatal overdose trends. This article examines faith-based community responses to the American overdose crisis through an extended case study of a church-led campaign in Massachusetts. In the summer of 2017, the state of Massachusetts released its fatal overdose numbers to the public: 2,069 people died of fatal overdose in 2016. In response, Trinity Church of Wrentham, Massachusetts, launched the #2069 campaign resulting in over 2,000 billboards and lawn signs emblazoned with #2069 displayed across the state. The memorial project fostered conversation, but also forged new community active in its work of social support, public health outreach and nonpartisan political engagement. The article considers the role of faith-based public health efforts and the potential for further interfaith and interracial collaboration on public health issues and the role of public religion in contesting conditions of despair.","Campbell, E.

"The Emotional Anatomy of Lockdown (preprint)","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, policy makers have tried to balance the effectiveness of lockdowns (or stay-at-home orders) with their potential mental health costs. Yet, two years into the pandemic, we are still lacking solid evidence about the emotional toll of lockdowns. Across two intensive longitudinal datasets with 14,511 observations collected in Australia in 2021 (total N = 441), we compare the degree, persistence, and regulation of peopleâ€™s emotions on days in and out of lockdown. We find that lockdowns take an emotional toll, but that this toll is relatively mild. In lockdown, people experienced slightly more negative and slightly less positive emotion;returned to a mildly negative emotional state more quickly;and used low-effort emotion regulation strategies. We conclude that people are resilient to the challenges lockdowns pose to personal and social well-being.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hxatc","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33601,""
"Assessment of Mental Health and Quality of Life among University Students during Covid-19 Pandemic in Malaysia, 2021 (preprint)","Background:  This research is conducted to know Malaysian university studentâ€™s mental health status and their quality of life during this COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, 2021. This study aims to associate sociodemographic background, paranoia level and resilience level with quality life. Quality of life is the general well-being of individuals whereas paranoia is the thought process that causes irrational suspicion or mistrust, and resilient is the ability of an individual able to adapt in faced the trouble. Methods The study was carried in the form of questionnaire that consisted of items on sociodemographic information, paranoia and resilience level and quality of life status. Sample population of 653 respondents were collected from both private and public universities. Data were later analyzed in frequencies and percentages, Chi-square test and as well as binary logistic regression (BLR). Results We found that the relation between QOL with resilience and paranoia. Normal (AOR 2.55) and high resilience (AOR = 2.75) people showing have higher quality of life while people with severe Paranoia (AOR 0.538) were less likely to have good Quality of life than those who reported with moderate paranoia. The most significant result indicates that high levels of resilience was associated with good QoL while student with moderate to severe paranoia will have low QoL. Conclusion As a result, university students from different sociodemographic background with high resilience and low paranoia level will have good quality of life. This study recommends future study to consider and investigate external factors that could affect this studyâ€™s outcome.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1756497/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33602,""
"Experiences participating in federal nutrition assistance programs during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed methods study in Vermont (preprint)","Background:  Federal nutrition assistance programs serve as safety nets for many American households, and participation has been linked to increased food security and, in some instances, improved diet quality and mental health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic brought new and increased economic, social, and psychological challenges, necessitating inquiry into how nutrition assistance programs are functioning and associated public health outcomes. Methods Using data from a representative statewide survey administered in Vermont (n = 600) during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine participant experiences with the 3 major federal nutrition assistance programs: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and school meal programs. We explore quantitative and qualitative responses regarding perceptions of program utility, and use nearest neighbors matching analyses in combination with bivariate statistical tests to assess associations between program participation and food insecurity, perceived stress, and fruit and vegetable intake as indicators of dietary quality. Results One in four respondents (27.3%) used at least one federal nutrition assistance program. As compared to non-participants, we find higher rates of food insecurity among program participants (57.5% vs. 18.1%;p &lt; .001), an association that persists even when we compare similar households using matching techniques (p = .001). From matched analyses, we find that, compared to low-income non-participants, low-income program participants are less likely to meet fruit intake recommendations (p = 0.048) and that low-income SNAP and WIC participants are less likely to meet vegetable intake recommendations (p = 0.035). We also find lower rates of perceived stress among low-income school meal participant households compared to low-income nonparticipants (p = 0.039). Despite these mixed outcomes, participants broadly valued federal nutrition assistance programs, characterizing them as helpful or easy to use. Conclusions We find that federal nutrition assistance programs as a group were not sufficient to address food insecurity and stress or increase fruit and vegetable intake in the state of Vermont during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, participants perceived benefits from participation in these programs. Optimizing the utility of nutrition assistance programs depends on critical examination of their functioning under conditions of great stress.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1754407/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33603,""
"Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection (preprint)","First infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with increased risk of acute and post-acute death and sequelae in the pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ systems. However, whether reinfection adds to the risk incurred after the first infection is not clear. Here we use the national health care databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of people with first infection (n = 257,427), reinfection (2 or more infections, n = 38,926), and a non-infected control group (n = 5,396,855) to estimate risks and 6-month burdens of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and a set of pre-specified incident outcomes. We show that compared to people with first infection, reinfection contributes additional risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and adverse health outcomes in the pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organ systems (cardiovascular disorders, coagulation and hematologic disorders, diabetes, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, kidney disorders, mental health disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurologic disorders);the risks were evident in those who were unvaccinated, had 1 shot, or 2 or more shots prior to the second infection;the risks were most pronounced in the acute phase, but persisted in the post-acute phase of reinfection, and most were still evident at 6 months after reinfection. Compared to non-infected controls, assessment of the cumulative risks of repeated infection showed that the risk and burden increased in a graded fashion according to the number of infections. The constellation of findings show that reinfection adds non-trivial risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and adverse health outcomes in the acute and post-acute phase of the reinfection. Reducing overall burden of death and disease due to SARS-CoV-2 will require strategies for reinfection prevention.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1749502/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33604,""
"Green space accessibility helps buffer declined mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Accumulating evidence has highlighted a negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. By using data from 2 million mobile phone users within London over the period of January 2019â€“December 2020, as well as the multi-wave data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS), we examined green space accessibility as a potential remedy for such an effect. We found that, after the COVID-19 outbreak and during lockdowns, individuals who live close to the green spaces (i.e., within 800 meters from the nearest green space) were more likely to pay visits to those spaces, and these individuals also experienced a much less mental distress than those who live farther away from green spaces. Our findings provide suggestive evidence that accessibility to green spaces is important to the populationâ€™s mental health, especially when their mobility is restricted. Enhancing green space accessibility for more residential neighbourhoods should thus be important to city planners and policymakers as they help citizens become more resilient to a similar future pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1725197/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33605,""
"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Prospectively Predicts Booster Vaccination Side-effects Six Months Later: Implications of this Psychosomatic Nocebo Component (preprint)","The directionality between vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine side-effects was not hitherto examined. Aligned with nocebo effects, vaccine hesitancy to the second Pfizer vaccination dose should predict subsequent side-effects to the booster dose, over and beyond all other effects. Furthermore, consistent with nocebo effects being driven by (mis)information in males, and by prior experience in females, compatible sex differences were predicted. A representative sample of older adults (n = 756, mean age = 68.9 Â± 3.43) were questioned in a typical cross-lagged design (wave 1 following the second Pfizer dose, wave 2 after their booster shot). Vaccine hesitancy, side-effect severity and demographics were reported at each wave. All predictions were confirmed. First, only the direction of earlier vaccine hesitancy predicting subsequent booster side-effects was significant, for females ( ÃŸ  = 0.10 p  = .025, f 2 =.02) and males ( ÃŸ  = 0.34, p  &lt; 0.001, f 2 = .16 ). Second, this effect was stronger in males ( <U+03C7> Â² <U+0394> (1) = 4.34, p  = .03). Third, the autoregression W1-to-W2 side-effect link was stronger in females ( ÃŸ  = .34, p  &lt; .001), than in males ( ÃŸ  = .18, p  &lt; .001), <U+03C7>Â²<U+0394> (1) = 26.86, p &lt; .001. The data show that a quantifiable and meaningful portion of COVID-19 vaccine side-effects is predicted by prior negative attitudes towards the vaccine (i.e., hesitancy), demonstrating that side-effects comprise a psychosomatic component in vaccinated individuals. The results reveal distinct risk levels for future side-effects and suggest implications for tailoring public health messaging to these psychosomatic effects.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1704655/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33606,""
"The applicability of Linehan Risk Assessment Scale: A cross-sectional study from Alexandria Poison Centre, Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Purpose:  Suicide is a critical health problem that is significantly rising during the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, yet it is still under-reported in Egypt. To date, a deficiency of a reliable scale to probe the risk factors underlying suicide liability among patients with deliberate self-poisoning. The study's objective was to offer a snapshot of the pattern of self- poisoning in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : Using the Linehan risk assessment and management protocol LRAMP, a psychological assessment was applied to evaluate vulnerable patients needing urgent psychiatric support and emphasize the influence of previous suicidal behaviors. A cross-sectional study was conducted on all patients admitted to Alexandria Poison Centre with deliberate self-poisoning Biosocial and poisoning data were recorded in a specially designed sheet. All patients were interviewed for underlying risk factors and protective factors for suicidal behavior. Results: : Significant relation was recorded between previous suicidal attempts and psychiatric diseases. CNS depressant drugs and rodenticides recorded the highest frequency. The calculated score (suicide and protective factors) was higher in patients with previous suicidal attempts.

"Can we hit prenatal depression and anxiety through HIIT? The effectiveness of online high intensity interval training on depressive symptoms, fear of childbirth, fear of coronavirus, and perception of quality of life in pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic â€“ a randomized controlled trial (preprint)","Background:  In recent years high intensity interval training (HIIT) has grown in popularity, however it rarely represent training interventions in experimental studies in pregnant populations so far. Therefore, in this study we aimed at assessing the changes in depressive symptoms, fear of childbirth, fear of Covid-19, quality of life after an 8-week supervised online HIIT program, compared to an educational (self-performed physical activity) program. Methods: : We conducted a randomized control trial among 54 Caucasian women in uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy (age 32 Â± 4 years, 22 Â± 4 week of gestation;mean Â± SD). There were 34 women in the experimental group, who participated in an 8-week high intensity interval training program (HIIT group). The comparative group was constituted of 20 pregnant women who attended 8-week educational program (EDU group). Results: : The most important finding was that after intervention the mental health improved somewhat in both groups, but only in the HIIT group the improvement was statistically significant. The positive trends in lowering the severity of depressive symptoms, fear of childbirth, and fear of Covid-19 were observed in both groups, however the positive response to the intervention was stronger in the EDU group. As secondary outcome, there was a significant decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness level in the EDU group, while the HIIT group maintained unchanged level of maximal oxygen uptake. Conclusions: : HIIT can be recommended for women with uncomplicated pregnancies to prevent depression and anxiety symptoms. However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of prenatal HIIT in pregnant women in various psychological conditions. Trial registration: We conducted this study in Poland, in 2021.

This study was carried out to investigate risk exposures, risk perceptions, challenges, and coping strategies, leading to anxiety and depression, among HCWs in Bangladesh. Methods: : Â This hospital-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from February to July 2021 among 1,112 frontline HCWs. Data were collected using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire including Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. A coping scale for COVID-19 (CS-COV-19) was developed and validated. To determine the predictors for symptoms of depression and anxiety, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and the associations between key variables are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Results: : A total of 54.9% (n=389) doctors and 51.4% (n= 207) nurses were found to have mild to severe anxiety status and 47% (n=333) doctors and 39.9% (n= 159) nurses were found to have mild to severe depression. HCWs, family members, neighbors had been affected with COVID-19 and those who experienced extra stresses at work were two times more likely to have anxiety. HCWs who had worried family and friends that they might get infected through them, confronted any negative social attitude or perceptions, decreased monthly income, and depression were 1.57 to 1.8 times more likely to experience anxiety than those who did not go through these experiences. Health workers who confronted negative social attitudes or social perceptions were 1.7 times more likely to have depression. Respondents, who had family members infected with COVID-19 and HCWs who worked for long hours at hospitals were almost two times more likely to have depression.

Conclusion:  We conclude that the increase in the prescription of psychotropic drugs is related to a higher probability of interactions.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.121692.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33613,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and mental health outcomes â€“ A cross-sectional study among health care workers in Coastal South India (preprint)","Background:  Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the early warning signs of mental distress is very important to ensure the provision of quality patient care. Methods: :Â  In this facility-based cross-sectional study, HCWs of the teaching hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore were assessed regarding their mental health status using a semi-structured questionnaire. All doctors and nurses who were willing to participate from these teaching hospitals were included in the study. Data was collected over a period of four months (1 st March -30 th June 2021) till the required sample size was reached and analysed using IBM SPSS and expressed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), and proportions. Univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with mental health outcomes among the HCWs and the corresponding unadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: :Â  A total of 245 HCWs [52.2% (n=128) doctors and 47.8% (n=117) nurses] were included in our study. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia assessed using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI-7 scales were 49% (n=119), 38% (n=93), and 42% (n=102) respectively. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were more likely to be experienced by HCWs aged &gt; 27 years, females, and involved in COVID-19 patient care. (p&gt;0.05) Conclusions: : Â Our findings that 38% of the examined HCWs had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms and 49% had clinically relevant depression symptoms draws attention to the importance of systematically tracking the mental health of HCWs during this ongoing pandemic. HCWs should monitor their stress reactions and seek appropriate help both on a personal and professional level. Appropriate workplace interventions including psychological support should be provided to HCWs, to ensure provision of uncompromised quality patient care.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.111193.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33614,""
"Responses to COVID-19 Threats: An Evolutionary Psychological Analysis (preprint)","Responses to COVID-19 public health interventions have been lukewarm. For example, only 64% of the US population has received at least two vaccinations. Because most public health interventions require people to behave in ways that are evolutionarily novel and mismatched with evolved human perceptual and decision-making mechanisms, it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of how people respond to public health information, including how they respond under different pandemic conditions and how specific groups may differ in their responses. We conducted two studies, using data from primarily public sources. We found that state-level COVID-19 threats (e.g., infection and mortality rates) had no relationships with mental health symptoms, suggesting that people were not attending to threat information. This result is consistent with the evolutionary psychological explanation that COVID-19 threat information is insufficient to activate the human behavioral immune system. Furthermore, individual differences affected how people responded to COVID-19 threats, supporting a niche picking explanation. Finally, aggregate state IQ levels correlated positively with aggregate vaccination rates, suggesting that intelligence can partially counteract the evolutionary novelty of abstract threat information, supporting the savanna-IQ interaction hypothesis. We conclude with policy implications for improving interventions and promoting greater compliance.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.20.22276460","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33615,""
"â€œIt hurts your heartâ€: frontline healthcare worker experiences of moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background Moral injury is defined as the strong emotional and cognitive reactions following events which clash with someoneâ€™s moral code, values or expectations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) has placed healthcare workers (HCWs) at risk of moral injury. Yet little is known about the lived experience of cumulative PMIE exposure and how NHS staff respond to this. Objective We sought to rectify this knowledge gap by qualitatively exploring the lived experiences and perspectives of clinical frontline NHS staff who responded to COVID-19. Methods We recruited a diverse sample of 30 clinical frontline HCWs from the NHS CHECK study cohort, for single time point qualitative interviews. All participants endorsed at least one item on the 9-item Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES) (Nash et al., 2013) at six month follow up. Interviews followed a semi-structured guide and were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results HCWs described being routinely exposed to ethical conflicts, created by exacerbations of pre-existing systemic issues including inadequate staffing and resourcing. We found that HCWs experienced a range of mental health symptoms primarily related to perceptions of institutional betrayal as well as feeling unable to fulfil their duty of care towards patients. Conclusion These results suggest that a multi-facetted organisational strategy is warranted to prepare for PMIE exposure, promote opportunities for resolution of symptoms associated with moral injury and prevent organisational disengagement. Highlights Clinical frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) have been exposed to an accumulation of potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including feeling betrayed by both government and NHS leaders as well as feeling unable to provide duty of care to patients HCWs described the significant adverse impact of this exposure on their mental health, including increased anxiety and depression symptoms and sleep disturbance Most HCWs interviewed believed that organisational change within the NHS was necessary to prevent excess PMIE exposure and promote resolution of moral distress","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.17.22276433","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33616,""
"Mental health of healthcare workers in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study (preprint)","Objective To examine variations in impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of all types of healthcare workers (HCWs) in England over the first 17 months of the pandemic. Method We undertook a prospective cohort study of 22,501 HCWs from 18 English acute and mental health NHS Trusts, collecting online survey data on common mental disorders (CMDs), depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and PTSD, from April 2020 to August 2021. We analysed these data cross-sectionally by time period (corresponding to periods the NHS was under most pressure), and longitudinally. Data were weighted to better represent Trust population demographics. Results The proportion of those with probable CMDs was greater during periods when the NHS was under most pressure (measured by average monthly deaths). For example, 55% (95%CI 53%, 58%) of participants reported symptoms of CMDs in April-June 2020 versus 47% (95%CI 46%, 48%) July-October 2020. Contrary to expectation, there were no major differences between professional groups (i.e. clinical and non-clinical staff). Younger, female, lower paid staff, who felt poorly supported by colleagues/managers, and who experienced potentially morally injurious events were most at risk of negative mental health outcomes. Conclusion Among HCWs, the prevalence of probable CMDs increased during periods of escalating pressure on the NHS, suggesting staff support should be increased at such points in the future, and staff should be better prepared for such situations via training. All staff, regardless of role, experienced poorer mental health during these periods, suggesting that support should be provided for all staff groups. Key messages What is already known on this topic Existing evidence about the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) through the COVID-19 pandemic comes mainly from cross-sectional studies using unrepresentative convenience samples, typically focussing on clinical staff rather than all HCWs. Such studies show high prevalence of symptoms of mental disorders, but the strength of this evidence is uncertain. What this study adds Using a defined sampling frame, with longitudinal, weighted data, we show that during periods of greater pressure on the NHS (as indicated by average monthly national COVID-19 death rates), prevalence of mental disorder symptoms increased, and, importantly, that this effect was seen in non-clinical as well as clinical staff. How this study might affect research, practice or policy These findings indicate that provision of support for HCWs should not only focus on those providing clinical care, but also on non-clinical staff such as porters, cleaners, and administrative staff, and additional support should be provided during higher pressure periods. Better preparation of staff for such situations is also suggested.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.16.22276479","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33617,""
"Moral injury and psychological wellbeing in UK healthcare staff (preprint)","Background Potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) can negatively impact mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic may have placed healthcare staff at risk of moral injury. Aim To examine the impact of PMIE on healthcare staff wellbeing. Method 12,965 healthcare staff (clinical and non-clinical) were recruited from 18 NHS-England trusts into a survey of PMIE exposure and wellbeing. Results PMIEs were significantly associated with adverse mental health symptoms across healthcare staff. Specific work factors were significantly associated with experiences of moral injury, including being redeployed, lack of PPE, and having a colleague die of COVID-19. Nurses who reported symptoms of mental disorders were more likely to report all forms of PMIEs than those without symptoms (AOR 2.7;95% CI 2.2, 3.3). Doctors who reported symptoms were only more likely to report betrayal events, such as breach of trust by colleagues (AOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5, 4.9). Conclusions A considerable proportion of NHS healthcare staff in both clinical and non-clinical roles report exposure to PMIEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prospective research is needed to identify the direction of causation between moral injury and mental disorder as well as continuing to monitor the longer term outcomes of exposure to PMIEs.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.16.22276476","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33618,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on College Studentsâ€™ at One of the Most Diverse Campuses in the United States: A Factor Analysis of Survey Data (preprint)","Objective This survey study is designed to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress among specific sub-populations of college students. Design, Settings and Participants An online questionnaire was sent to the students from University of Nevada, Las Vegas between 2020 October and December to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19. A total of 2,091 respondents signed the consent form online and their responses were collected. Methods The Perceived Stress levels of college students were analyzed via exploratory factor analysis of a survey of college students, which was collected at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). An explanatory factor analysis was carried out on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) results. We subsequently analyzed each factor using stepwise linear regression that focused on various socio-demographic groups. Results A two-factor model was obtained using the explanatory factor analysis. After comparing with the past studies that investigated the factor structure of the PSS-10 scale, we identified these two factors as â€œAnxietyâ€ and â€œIrritabilityâ€. The subsequent stepwise linear regression analysis suggested that gender and age ( P &lt; 0.01) are significantly associated with both factors. However, the ethnicities of students are not significantly associated with both factors. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed the perceived stress of university students in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. We showed that the PSS-10 scale could be summarized as a two-factor structure through an exploratory factor analysis. A stepwise regression approach was used and we found both of the factors are significantly associated with the gender of the participants. However, we found no significant association between both factors and ethnicity. In summary, our findings will help identify students with higher risk for stress and mental health issues in pandemics and future crises. Strengths and limitations of this study <U+27A3> To our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed the perceived stress of university students with PSS-10 scale in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. <U+27A3> Ethnicities of the participants are not significantly associated with the perceived stress. This finding is different compared to most of the previous studies. <U+27A3> Only quantitative questions were used in this survey study. To gain a better understanding for the psychological impact of COVID-19 on students, qualitative questions need to be included in the future survey studies. <U+27A3> The fact that only the participants who completed the PSS-10 scale were included in the quantitative analysis in this study leads to potential selection bias. <U+27A3> The proportions of African American students and Pacific Islander students are low within the survey sample compared to the demographics of UNLV. This leads to potential volunteer bias.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.14.22276416","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33619,""
"Inequalities in childrenâ€™s mental health care: analysis of routinely collected data on prescribing and referrals to secondary care (preprint)","Introduction One in eight children in the United Kingdom are estimated to have a mental health condition, and many do not receive support or treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated this issue. Prevalence of poor mental health is not evenly distributed across age-groups, by sex or socioeconomic groups. Equity in access to mental health care is a policy priority but relatively under-researched. Methods We linked previously unlinked records for all mental health prescriptions and referrals to specialist mental health outpatient care between the years of 2015 and 2021 for children aged 2 to 17 in an NHS Scotland health board region. We analysed trends in prescribing, referrals, and acceptance to out-patient treatment over time, and measured differences in treatment and service use rates by age, sex, and area deprivation. Results We identified 18,732 children with 178,657 mental health prescriptions and 21,874 referrals to specialist outpatient care. Annually 3.1% of children had a mental health prescription and 2.8% had a specialist referral. Prescriptions increased by 59% over the study period. Boys received double the prescriptions of girls and the rate of prescribing in the most deprived areas was double that in the least deprived. Referrals increased 9% overall. Initially, both boys and girls both had an equal annual referral rate, but this fell 6% for boys and rose 25% for girls. Referral rate for the youngest decreased 67% but increased 21% for the oldest. The proportion of referrals rejected increased since 2020 from 17% to 30%. The mean age of those accepted to specialist treatment increased by 1.5 years and of referrals which were accepted, the proportion who were girls increased. Discussion The large increase in mental health prescribing and changes in referrals to specialist outpatient care aligns with emerging evidence of increasing poor mental health, particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The static size of the population accepted for specialist treatment amid greater demand, and the changing demographics of those accepted, indicate clinical prioritisation and unmet need.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.14.22276082","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33620,""
"A rapid review of the effectiveness of innovations to support patients on elective surgical waiting lists (preprint)","Surgical waiting times have reached a record high, in particular with elective and non-emergency treatments being suspended or delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged waits for surgery can impact negatively on patients who may experience worse health outcomes, poor mental health, disease progression, or even death. Time spent waiting for surgery may be better utilised in preparing patients for surgery. This rapid review sought to identify innovations to support patients on surgical waiting lists to inform policy and strategy to address the elective surgical backlog in Wales. The review is based on the findings of existing reviews with priority given to robust evidence synthesis using minimum standards (systematic search, study selection, quality assessment, and appropriate synthesis). The search dates for prioritised reviews ranged from 2014-2021. Forty-eight systematic reviews were included. Most available evidence is derived from orthopaedic surgery reviews which may limit generalisability. The findings show benefits of exercise, education, smoking cessation, and psychological interventions for patients awaiting elective surgery. Policymakers, educators, and clinicians should consider recommending such interventions to be covered in curricula for health professionals. Further research is required to understand how various patient subgroups respond to preoperative interventions, including those from underserved and minority ethnic groups, more deprived groups and those with lower educational attainments. Further research is also needed on social prescribing or other community-centred approaches. It is unclear what impact the pandemic (and any associated restrictions) could have on the conduct or effectiveness of these interventions.

TOPLINE SUMMARY Our rapid reviews use a variation of the systematic review approach, abbreviating or omitting some components to generate the evidence to inform stakeholders promptly whilst maintaining attention to bias. They follow the methodological recommendations and minimum standards for conducting and reporting rapid reviews, including a structured protocol, systematic search, screening, data extraction, critical appraisal, and evidence synthesis to answer a specific question and identify key research gaps. They take 1-2 months, depending on the breadth and complexity of the research topic/ question(s), extent of the evidence base, and type of analysis required for synthesis. Who is this summary for? Health Boards and others involved in planning, monitoring, managing waiting lists for surgery. Background / Aim of Rapid Review Surgical waiting times have reached a record high , in particular with elective and non-emergency treatments being suspended or delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged waits for surgery can impact negatively on patients who may experience worse health outcomes, poor mental health, disease progression, or even death. Time spent waiting for surgery may be better utilised in preparing atients for surgery. This rapid review sought to identify innovations to support patients on surgical waiting lists to inform policy and strategy to address the elective surgical backlog in Wales. The review is based on the findings of existing reviews with priority given to robust evidence synthesis using minimum standards (systematic search, study selection, quality assessment, and appropriate synthesis). Key Findings Extent of the evidence base <U+25AA> 48 systematic reviews were included;17 reviews were prioritised for inclusion in the narrative synthesis . A further 10 protocols of ongoing systematic reviews were included. <U+25AA> Most reviews (n=23) focused on orthopaedic surgical procedures . <U+25AA> Most reviews (n=31) focussed on exercise-based interventions . Other interventions were educational (n=6), psychological (n=2), smoking cessation (n=1), weight loss (n=1), and multicomponent interventions (n=7). <U+25AA> There were limited data provided on socio-demographic characteristics of patients. <U+25AA> No review evaluated the impact of the intervention on surgical treatment. <U+25AA> No evidence relating to the use of social prescribing or other community-centred approaches to support surgical wait-listed patients was identified. <U+25AA> No evidence was identified in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic . Recency of the evidence base <U+25AA> The search dates for the prioritised reviews ranged from 2014-2021;these were conducted in 2020 (n=3) or 2021 (n=3) for six reviews. Evidence of effectiveness <U+25AA> Preoperative exercise interventions (n=9;6 were orthopaedic) could help improve preoperative and postoperative outcomes such as pain, muscle strength and function, and reduced incidence of postoperative complications , in people awaiting elective surgery. <U+25AA> Educational interventions (n=3;1 was orthopaedic) were effective at improving knowledge in patients awaiting elective surgery. However, the evidence about these interventions improving pre- and postoperative pain and physical functioning in orthopaedic patients is limited . There were mixed findings for the effectiveness of preoperative educational interventions on psychological outcomes. <U+25AA> Psychological interventions (n=2;1 was orthopaedic) evidence is limited but indicates it may have a positive effect on anxiety and mental health components of quality of life postoperatively. The evidence in support of such interventions in reducing postoperative pain is inconclusive. <U+25AA> Smoking cessation interventions (n=1) providing behavioural support and offering nicotine replacement therapy i ncreased short-term smoking cessation and may reduce postoperative morbidity . Intensive preoperative smoking cessation interventions appear to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications, but not brief interventions. <U+25AA> Multicomponent interventions (n=2;1 was orthopaedic) consisting of both exercise and education components could shorten the length of hospital stay and improve postoperative pain, function, and muscle strength . Best quality evidence Three reviews were treated as high quality. Two evaluating exercise-based interventions (Fenton et al. 2021;Katsura et al. 2015) and one psychological preparation (Powell et al. 2016). Policy Implications <U+25AA> Most available evidence is derived from orthopaedic surgery reviews which may limit generalisability . <U+25AA> These findings show benefits of exercise, education, smoking cessation, and psychological interventions for patients awaiting elective surgery .

"Mask Mandateâ€™s Effect on Job Loss Expectation and Mental Health in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Uncertainty around economic recovery from a pandemic, in addition to restrictions on mobility and socializing, can be isolating and stressful. While preventive measures, such as mask mandates, are expected to mitigate spread of the disease and lower concerns of future job loss, state- and local-level mandates could signal that infection rates are worse in the mandated areas and decrease consumer confidence and mobility. Thus, the association between mask mandates and psychological well-being is unclear. Twenty-five states in the United States implemented statewide mask mandates early in the pandemic. This study seeks to examine the effect of mask mandates on self-reported job loss expectation and mental health, using data from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Household Pulse Survey data, collected between April 23rd and July 21st, 2020. In the individual-level panel data, job loss expectation was lower by 1.1 percentage point by the second week of a statewide mask mandate and by 1.6 percentage point by the third week, compared to average job loss expectation in states without a mask mandate and to the mandate states before the policy implementation. Average job loss expectation was 6.5 percentage point lower by the twelfth week in the five states that were the first to implement statewide mask mandates. Mental health status improved steadily from the fourth week on in states with a mask mandate. Analysis of state-aggregated data indicates considerable variability and lack of uniformity in mask mandatesâ€™ impact on job loss expectation and mental health status.","Mandal, Bidisha","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mask+Mandateâ€™s+Effect+on+Job+Loss+Expectation+and+Mental+Health+in+the+United+States+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33622,""
"Psychological outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with Parkinson's disease: A systematic review","There were concerns about the psychological outcomes of coronavirus disease from the beginning of the pandemic. Parkinson's disease (PD) patients seem to be more vulnerable to mental health disorders like stress, depression, anxiety, or worsening quality of life during COVID-19 lockdown. We aimed to conduct a systematic review to investigate the psychological outcomes of COVID-19 among the PD population. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We included original studies which reported the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the PD population with a minimum of 10 cases. After the screening, 21 studies with a total of 5236 PD cases were included in our qualitative synthesis. Depression, anxiety, and to less extent sleep disorders and apathy are the most studied psychological outcomes. Most of the studies indicated that the severity or the prevalence of psychiatric disturbance increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic in PD patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 14% to 66.5%, while depression was reported in 0% to 50% of PD patients during and after the pandemic. Also, sleep problems were reported in 35.4% to 68.9% of PD patients. Considering the overall trend of increment in the severity of the main psychological outcomes observed in the present systematic review, it is suggested that future studies conduct a more accurate analysis of the prevalence, severity, and associated pathology of psychological outcomes of COVID-19 in PD patients.","Nabizadeh, Seyedalhosseini, Balabandian, Reza Rostami","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2022.06.017","20220701","COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Psychological outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33623,""

"Differences in self-perception of productivity and mental health among the STEMM-field scientists during the COVID-19 pandemic by sex and status as a parent: A survey in six languages","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges for working conditions for scientists, but little is known for how the associations of these challenges with scientists' mental health and productivity differ by sex and status as a parent. This online survey study in six languages collected data from 4,494 scientists in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine fields across 132 countries during October-December 2021. We compared the type of challenges for work, changes in work hours, and perception in productivity during the pandemic by sex and status as a parent (children &lt;18 years living at home). Regression analyses analyzed the impacts of changed working conditions and work-life factors on productivity and mental health. We found that the percentage of participants with increased work hours was the highest in female participants, especially without children. Disproportionately higher increases in work hours were found for teaching and administration in women than men and for research/fundraising in non-parent participants than parent participants (p-value&lt;0.001). Female participants were more concerned about the negative impacts of the pandemic on publications and long-term career progress, and less satisfied with their career progress than their male counterparts. There were differences in the type of institutional actions for the pandemic across study regions. The identified obstacles for work and home-life factors were associated with higher risks of experiencing depression, anxiety, and stress. Decision makers should consider the gender differences in the pandemic's adverse impacts on productivity in establishing equitable actions for career progress for scientists during pandemics.","Heo, Peralta, Jin, Pereira Nunes, Bell","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269834","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33625,""
"Mixed methods prospective findings of the initial effects of the US COVID-19 pandemic on individuals in recovery from substance use disorder","The beginning of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic interrupted integral services and supports for those in recovery from substance use disorders. The current study used qualitative and quantitative data to identify 1) pandemic-related barriers/stressors, 2) coping strategies employed, and 3) how the stressors and strategies predicted subsequent substance use frequency. Participants were 48 adults (40.5% female; 90.2% White) between 26 and 60 years old (M = 42.66, SD = 8.44) who were part of a larger, multi-year longitudinal study of individuals in recovery from substance use disorders. Individuals completed two interviews, one during the six weeks of initial stay-at-home orders in the state in which data were collected and the second within six to twelve months of their initial interview. Common barriers to recovery included cancelled support meetings, changes in job format (i.e., being fired or furloughed), and lack of social support. Common coping strategies included self-care, leisure activities/hobbies, taking caution against exposure, and strengthening personal relationships. The relationship between cravings at baseline and substance use at follow up was stronger for those who experienced worsening of their mental health (B = 21.80, p &lt; .01) than for those who did not (B = 5.45, p = 0.09), and for those who were taking caution against exposure (B = 24.57, p &lt; .01) than for those who were not (B = 1.87, p = 0.53). Those who engaged in self-care (B = 0.00, p&gt;.99) had lower rates of substance use at follow-up than those who did not employ self-care as a coping mechanism (B = 16.10, p &lt; .01). These findings inform research priorities regarding prospective effects of the pandemic on treatment endeavors, particularly emphasizing treating mental health and encouraging self-care strategies.","Shircliff, Liu, Prestigiacomo, Fry, Ladd, Gilbert, Rattermann, Cyders","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270582","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33626,""
"Trajectories and Associations Between Maternal Depressive Symptoms, Household Chaos and Children's Adjustment through the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Four-Wave Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures have adversely affected the lives of people worldwide, raising concern over the pandemic's mental health consequences. Guided by a systemic model of family functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic (Prime et al., 2020), the current study aimed to examine how caregiver well-being (i.e., maternal depressive symptoms) and family organization (i.e., household chaos) are related to longitudinal trajectories of children's emotional and behavioral problems. Data were collected at four time points during and after home lockdown periods. Mothers of children (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°230; 55% male) between the ages of two to five years were asked to complete questionnaires via an Israeli online research platform. Results indicated that emotional and behavioral problems, household chaos, and maternal depressive symptoms were the highest during the first lockdown assessment and dropped in the post-lockdown periods. Multilevel models further revealed that at the between-participants level, maternal depressive symptoms and household chaos positively predicted children's emotional and behavioral problems. At the within-participants level, household chaos fluctuations positively predicted fluctuations in child behavioral but not emotional problems. Our findings suggest that lockdowns have adverse effects on both maternal and child mental health. Screening for depressive symptoms among mothers of young children and maintaining household structure are important targets for future interventions to assist parents in navigating the multiple challenges brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gordon-Hacker, Bar-Shachar, Egotubov, Uzefovsky, Gueron-Sela","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-022-00954-w","20220701","COVID-19; Child behavior problems; Child emotional problems; Family processes; Household chaos; Maternal depressive symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33627,""
"Functional and mental health affection (depression, anxiety, stress) among Egyptian rheumatic diseases patients during COVID-19 pandemic","Psychological distress caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has had deleterious effects on patients with chronic rheumatic disease, as those patients were highly susceptible for COVID-19 infection due to their chronicity, in addition to use of immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, they underwent to more isolation than other people and develop more stress and depression. This study aimed at evaluating level of depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and physical health status in Egyptian patients with various rheumatic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. It included 440 diagnosed cases of rheumatic diseases from 1st to the end of March 2021. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS21) and RAPID3/MDHAQ test were used to assess the pandemic's psychological and functional effect on participants. RAPID3 test results showed that during the COVID-19 outbreak the 40% of patients had a moderate severity functional affection and 20% had high severity. DASS21 depression scoring showed mild to moderate depression (33% and 35%, respectively), while severe depression was detected in only 3.2% of cases. Moderate anxiety was reported in 49% of cases, 29% had severe anxiety while 1% showed extremely severe anxiety. Mild to moderate stress was reported in 17% and 16%, respectively. Female and cases aged more than 45 years had significantly more severe functional affection recorded by RAPID3 test, moderate stress and severe anxiety. On the other hand, severe depression was significantly higher in male and young patients younger than 45 years old. Rheumatic disease patients have been highly susceptible to functional affection and psychological distress related to COVID-19 pandemic. Planning and implementation of programs to enforce coping strategies for these patients are required.","El Khouly, Elsabagh, Moawad, Afifi, Abo El Hawa","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202206_29087","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33628,""
"Mental Health Impact and Burnout in Critical Care Staff During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak","The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak exposed intensive care unit health care workers to a psychological burden. The aim of the study was to assess burnout, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in the intensive care unit staff during the pandemic period and to focus on the factors that contributed to psychological discomfort by using validated psychometric tools. This was a monocentric study developed at the end of the first emergency crisis period (May 2020). We used a custom-designed survey using SurveyMonkey. The first part of the online survey included 27 general questions (sociodemographic information, the professional role, and possible changes assigned in job tasks and duties), the second part included validated psychometric tools: Maslach Burnout Inventory, General Health Questionnaire-12 Items, Impact of Event Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Factors indepen- dently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified. The response rate was 88%, with 95 respondents. Depressive and mild-moderate anxiety symptoms were reported in 20% and in 12% of health care workers, respectively, and half of the sample experienced moderate or severe post-traumatic stress symptoms. In total, 64% of health care workers reported high levels of burnout. General mental health problems were more frequently reported by women (P =.3), by those who were tested negative for the coronavirus disease 2019 buffer (P &lt; .02), and by those who changed their family habits (P =.02) as a consequence of the pandemic. Being single or divorced (P = .04) was associated with the presence of depressive symptoms; vice versa, cohabiting with a partner or being married was associated with lower levels of depression. Anxious symptoms were reported in health care workers with no previous working experience in the intensive care unit. Health care workers experience high levels of psychological burden during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Knowing the risk factors can aid to develop strategies of observation and prevention and also strengthen the ability to be resilient to stressful situations.","Gramaglia, Bazzano, Gambaro, Cena, Azzolina, Costa, Zeppegno, Della Corte","https://doi.org/10.5152/TJAR.2022.21263","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33629,""
"Assessment of Anxiety, Depression and Work-Related Strain Levels of Healthcare Professionals Working in Operating Rooms and Intensive Care Units During the COVID-19 Outbreak","The purpose of the study was to determine the levels of work-related strain, anxiety, and depression in health professionals working in operating rooms and intensive care units who deal with the diagnosis, treatment, and care of coronavirus disease 19 patients. The population of the study consisted of 320 healthcare professionals working in the operating room and intensive care units. After providing detailed information about the study to the participants, a questionnaire consisting of 21 questions including sociodemographic infor- mation and working life characteristics, 14 questions from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and 18 questions from the Work-Related Strain Inventory (WRSI) were administered under supervision. In total, 58.8% of the participants were working in intensive care units, and 41.2% of the participants were in the operating room. The scores obtained from Work-Related Strain Inventory were found to be statistically significantly high in those who wanted to choose a differ- ent profession, those who were on duty during the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic process, those whose spouses followed coronavirus disease 19 patients during the pandemic, those who encountered a suspicious situation and had a coronavirus disease 19 test, those who had difficulty in accessing personal protective equipment, and those who thought that their lives were in danger during the pandemic process. Participants with anxiety risk according to Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale and depression risk according to Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression subscale were found to be 153 (47.8%) and 300 (93.8%), respectively.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency general surgery outcomes: A single-center retrospective cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health-care system unpredictably. Restrictions and precautions have had a significant impact on the volume and nature of admissions in emergency services. In this study, we hypothesized that the pandemic would result in a change in the number of emergencies admitted to the general surgery inpatient service and a worse patient outcome compared to the previous year. A retrospective analysis of emergency general surgical admissions during the first 6 months of the pandemic and the same period in 2019 was conducted. Demographics, laboratory assessments, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and postoperative out-comes were analyzed. 761 patients were admitted to the general surgery service during two 6-month periods (392 vs. 369, respectively). This represented a 5.9% reduction in admissions. However, in the first 2 months of the pandemic, the number of emergency general surgical admissions decreased by 37.1% and 43.7%, respectively. Comparison of periods demonstrated no significant differences in demograph-ics, laboratory values, incidence of emergencies, treatment strategies, and hospital stay. Acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, and bowel obstruction were the three most common surgical emergencies in the pandemic. However, there was no significant difference in outcomes between the periods when each surgical emergency was evaluated separately. Pandemic appears to affect general surgical admissions with a fluctuating pattern, an increasing trend following a sig-nificant 2-month decrease. These findings suggest that patients presented with a delayed presentation; however, contrary to concerns, there was no difference in patient outcomes between the two periods. This study provides a perspective in management strategies for surgical emergencies in such unusual conditions.","Ãƒâ€¡elik, Lapsekili, AlakuÃ…Å¸","https://doi.org/10.14744/tjtes.2021.89287","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33631,""
"Experiences of COVID-19-Recovered Healthcare Workers in a Tertiary Hospital in the Philippines: A Mixed-Method Inquiry","COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of the global population. Among the most vulnerable are the healthcare workers (HCWs) who got infected but returned to the frontline after recovery. Currently, there is a dearth of information and understanding on the psychological status and actual lived experience of the recovered HCWs in the Philippines. The present study investigated the psychological status and experiences of 93 COVID-19-recovered HCWs from a tertiary hospital in the Philippines using a mixed-method approach, particularly the explanatory-sequential design. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 in the quantitative phase. Selected participants took part in focus group discussions in the qualitative phase. Integrated results showed that our participants experienced significant COVID-19-related distress (mean IES-R scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.5; partial impact), anxiety (mean subscale scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.4; mild), and depression (mean subscale scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.1; mild). Certain sociodemographic and professional characteristics and the length of quarantine days appear to affect the psychometric scores. The quantitative results are supported by the participant's description of recovery experiences as living in uncertainty, distress, fatigue, dissociation, and valuation of life. In summary, adequate psychological support and intervention program should be prioritized and provided by hospital management for recovered HCWs to prevent the development of more serious mental health concerns that may significantly affect their tasks in caring for patients and in-hospital management.","Carascal, Capistrano, Figueras, Cataylo, ZuÃƒÂ±iga, Reyes, Medriano, Gamo, Mendoza, Macalipay","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221107051","20220701","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; healthcare worker; lived experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33632,""

We conducted an observational, prospective cohort study, including patients Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years old with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April to July 2020. All participants underwent two clinical follow-up visits, the first at 4-months (Visit 1) and the second at 1 year, after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Visit 2). Plasma glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. Regarding pulmonary function, spirometry and lung diffusion capacity tests were assessed. For mental and neurocognitive evaluation, a short-form (SF-12), Beck depression and Hospital-Anxiety depression questionnaires were conducted at both time-points, whereas the Montreal Cognitive assessment was conducted during the second follow-up. Regarding to sleep evaluation, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Insomnia Severity index and STOP-BANG questionnaire were conducted. Additionally, a home sleep apnea test and 7-day wrist actigraphy were performed in all participants. Inflammatory cytokines were measured using an inflammatory cytokine bead array kit. <i>p-</i>values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant and statistical analyses were performed using R software. A total of 60 patients were included in the first follow-up, from which 57 completed the second follow-up.

An anonymous online questionnaire and snowball recruiting technique were used to target the general public in Palestine between 6 and 16 April, 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed for the outcome variables. Of the 2819 individuals who completed the questionnaire, more than two thirds of them (72.6%) were females. Nearly (83.5%), were residing at the West Bank. The mean age of participants was 29.47 (<i>SD</i> = 10.97) years. The anxiety prevalence was (25.15%) with (20.08%) had mild/moderate severity. The stress prevalence was (38.77%) with (22.21%) had mild/moderate severity. The prevalence of both anxiety and stress was (20.3%). In multivariate analysis, exposure to confirmed case of COVID-19, inadequacy of food supply and jobs that acquire leaving home during lockdown were significantly related to higher anxiety degree. As for stress, low monthly income, cohabitation with a person of a high-risk group and inadequacy of food supply were significantly related to higher stress degree. Young adults with low socioeconomic status and inadequate food supply were more likely to have a higher degree of stress and/or anxiety.

"Considerations of CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells for Optimized Vaccine Strategies Against Respiratory Viruses","The primary goal of vaccines that protect against respiratory viruses appears to be the induction of neutralizing antibodies for a long period. Although this goal need not be changed, recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have drawn strong attention to another arm of acquired immunity, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are also called killer T cells. Recent evidence accumulated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed that even variants of SARS-CoV-2 that escaped from neutralizing-antibodies that were induced by either infection or vaccination could not escape from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immunity. In addition, although traditional vaccine platforms, such as inactivated virus and subunit vaccines, are less efficient in inducing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, newly introduced platforms for SARS-CoV-2, namely, mRNA and adenoviral vector vaccines, can induce strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immunity in addition to inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells function locally and need to be at the site of infection to control it. To fully utilize the protective performance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, it would be insufficient to induce only memory cells circulating in blood, using injectable vaccines; mucosal immunization could be required to set up CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for the optimal protection. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might also contribute to the pathology of the infection, change their function with age and respond differently to booster vaccines in comparison with antibodies. Herein, we overview cutting-edge ideas on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immunity that can enable the rational design of vaccines for respiratory viruses.","Hirai, Yoshioka","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.918611","20220701","CD8 T cells; SARS-CoV-2; aging; attrition; booster vaccines; tissue-resident memory T cell","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33635,""
"Internet Addiction, Symptoms of Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Stress Among Higher Education Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Poor mental health is a growing concern among young people during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the associations of Internet addiction with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress in higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to examine these mental health problems in the context of study-related characteristics. The research sample consisted of 3,099 participants from the Czech Republic (CZ: 1,422) and Slovak Republic (SK: 1,677). The Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to measure mental health problems. The analyses also included demographic data (gender and age) and study-related characteristics (form of study, degree of study, field of study, distance between college and home, and housing during the semester). Based on the results of frequency and descriptive analyses, the prevalence of mental health problems was high. The most serious levels of Internet addiction (IAT cut-off point Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50), to which attention should be paid, were found in 3.5% of Czech and 6.2% of Slovak students. Using the standard cut-off point of GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10, 14.1% of Czech and 11.6% of Slovak students were identified with anxiety symptoms. Regarding the PHQ-9 with the cut-off point Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10, 23.4% of Czech and 19.1% of Slovak students had depressive symptoms, which should be addressed. Using the PSS cut-off point Ã¢â€°Â¥ 27, 12.9% of Czech students and 9.1% of Slovak students perceived high stress. The quantile regression analysis showed that Internet addiction was positively associated with anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and stress in all of the analyzed cases (<i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.001). In terms of study-related characteristics, the binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that risk factors for mental health problems in Czech and Slovak students were mainly full-time form of study and living away from home during the semester.

"COVID-19 Preventive Measures in Northern California Jails: Perceived Deficiencies, Barriers, and Unintended Harms","Carceral facilities are high-risk settings for COVID-19 transmission. Little is known about the hidden burden of infection or practical barriers to infection control in these settings, especially in jails. There is also limited research on the mental health impacts of the pandemic among people living and working in carceral facilities. Between July 8, 2020 and April 30, 2021, we performed SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody testing and administered a questionnaire among residents and staff of four Northern California jails. We utilized multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic and carceral characteristics, to analyze factors associated with prior infection, including perceived likelihood of prior infection and access to new masks. We additionally assessed the implementation of, perceptions toward, and impacts of COVID-19 policies in practice. We engaged stakeholder representatives, including incarcerated individuals, to guide study design, procedures, and results interpretation. We enrolled 788 jail residents and 380 jail staff. Nearly half of residents and two-thirds of staff who were antibody-positive had not previously tested positive for COVID-19. Among residents without a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, antibody positivity was significantly associated with perceived likelihood of prior infection (adjusted OR = 8.9; 95% CI, 3.6-22.0). Residents who had flu-like illness in jail cited inadequate responses to reported illness and deterrents to symptom reporting, including fears of medical isolation and perceptions of medical neglect. Residents also disclosed deficient access to face masks, which was associated with antibody positivity (adjusted OR = 13.8, 95% CI, 1.8-107.0). Worsened mental health was pervasive among residents, attributed not only to fear of COVID-19 and unsanitary jail conditions but also to intensified isolation and deprivation due to pandemic restrictions on in-person visitation, programs, and recreation time. Carceral settings present significant challenges to maintaining infection control and human rights. Custody officials should work diligently to transform the conditions of medical isolation, which could mitigate deterrents to symptom reporting. Furthermore, they should minimize use of restrictive measures like lockdowns and suspension of visitation that exacerbate the mental health harms of incarceration. Instead, custody officials should ensure comprehensive implementation of other preventive strategies like masking, testing, and vaccination, in conjunction with multisector efforts to advance decarceration.","Liu, LeBoa, Rodriguez, Sherif, Trinidad, Del Rosario, Allen, Clifford, Redding, Chen, Rosas, Morales, Chyorny, Andrews","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.854343","20220701","COVID-19; community-based research; incarceration; infection control; jails; mental health; seroprevalence; stakeholder engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33637,""

The study of the population's attitude toward vaccination and detection of the predictive important individual psychological and social factors defining the vaccination necessity perception will allow elaborating promoting vaccination adherence measures. The aim of this research was to study COVID-19 threat appraisal, fear of COVID-19, trust in COVID-19 information sources, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and the relationship of sociodemographic variables to COVID-19 preventive behavior. We carried out a cohort cross-sectional study of the population's attitude toward vaccination against the novel COVID-19 coronavirus infection, using a specially designed questionnaire for an online survey. Totally, there were 4,977 respondents, ranging in age from 18 to 81 years. Statistical assessment was carried out using the SPSS-11 program. There were different attitudes toward vaccination. Among respondents, 34.2% considered vaccination to be useful, 31.1% doubted its effectiveness, and 9.9% considered vaccination unnecessary. The survey indicated that 7.4% of respondents were indifferent to the vaccine, while 12.2% deemed it to be dangerous. Nearly one-third (32.3%) of respondents indicated that they did not plan to be vaccinated, while another third (34.0%) would postpone their decision until more comprehensive data on the results and effectiveness of vaccination were available. Only 11.6% of the respondents were vaccinated at the time of the study. Young people were less focused on vaccination compared to middle-aged and elderly people. Receiving information concerning COVID-19 vaccination from healthcare workers and scientific experts was associated with greater vaccination acceptance. The study results showed that vaccination attitudes interacted with individuals' mental health and various sociodemographic factors. Insofar as reports of physicians and experts are essential for shaping attitudes to vaccination, the study results inform the selection of target groups in need of particular psychosocial interventions to overcome their vaccine hesitancy.","Vasileva, Karavaeva, Radionov, Yakovlev, Mitin, Caroppo, Barshak, Nazarov","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.835323","20220701","COVID-19; attitudes toward vaccination; coronavirus infection; pandemic; psychosocial interventions targets","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33638,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on nursing personnel: A regional online survey","This study investigated mental health reactions to dealing with COVID-19 in a population of nurses working in a variety of settings. The study attempted to expand our current understanding of the psychological reactions unique to nurses working during the highly stressful period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study used an online questionnaire design. Nurses were recruited using social media via an electronic link between July and September 2020. Of them, 112 nursing professionals completed the 66-item questionnaire. Significant findings included the presence of moderate or greater levels of anxiety (62%), depression (31%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (15%) and with significantly greater intrusive thoughts and memories for nurses who provided direct patient care than those who did not. Nurses with a prior history of anxiety or depression were found to be at greater risk for psychological distress. Results further highlighted concerns and fears related to coronavirus in both their daily personal and professional lives. The use of standard, commonly used, measures of psychological disorders allow for a more precise comparison among studies both for this population at the time of the survey and over a period of time. Suggestions for helping nursing professionals identify nurses at risk and improved ways to cope and deal with adverse psychological effects are discussed.","Hickling, Barnett","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15339","20220701","BDI-II; COVID-19; GAD-7.PCL-5; PTSD; anxiety; depression; nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33639,""
"Acceptability and feasibility of an online version of the Self-Compassion for Healthcare Communities program","Self-compassion, a way of relating to oneself like a good friend, may be an essential skill for healthcare professionals to develop in order to cope with the stressors of their job and avoid burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and other mental health problems during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the acceptability and feasibility of an online version of the 6-session Self-Compassion for Healthcare Communities program (SCHC) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Similar to in-person studies of the program, participants (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 37) reported significant increases in self-compassion and mindfulness, and significant decreases in burnout, secondary traumatic stress, depression, and stress from pre to post intervention. Number of sessions attended predicted gains in self-compassion and increases in self-compassion predicted changes in mindfulness, secondary traumatic stress, burnout, depression, and resilience decompression. Online programs such as SCHC may be an accessible way to support healthcare professionals' mental health even after the pandemic is over.","Knox, Franco","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2094428","20220701","COVID-19; Self-compassion; healthcare; online intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33640,""

This study aims to analyze the patterns and variations of mental health teleconsultation (especially for insomnia and depression) on selected Android-based mHealth platforms in Indonesia. We performed 32 teleconsultation sessions on 8 most popular mHealth platforms. About 88% of doctors recommend that patients with depression visit a psychiatrist. On the other hand, 38% of doctors recommended visiting a psychiatrist for insomnia cases. Our findings show differences and similarities in handling depression and insomnia cases in the Indonesian mHealth apps.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physician Electronic Health Record Use and Burden at a Canadian Mental Health Hospital","The COVID-19 Pandemic has significantly changed the delivery of care through new workflows and models of care. However, the impact of these changes on the usage of electronic health record (EHR) systems remains unclear. This mixed method study aims to understand how EHR usage patterns changed between the pandemic onset and the pre-pandemic period at a Canadian mental health hospital, using an analysis of EHR usage log data and a qualitative focus group. An increase in after-hours EHR usage and documentation time per patient was observed, as well as a decrease in order time. Virtual care (VC) use also had an impact on time spent per patient within the EHR and after-hours EHR usage. Qualitative results highlighted physician concerns related to VC workflows and documentation, which contributed to additional EHR burden.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health Services in Scotland, UK","There is a global emergency in relation to mental health (MH) and healthcare. In the UK each year, 1 in 4 people will experience MH problems. Healthcare services are increasingly oversubscribed, and COVID-19 has deepened the healthcare gap. We investigated the effect of COVID-19 on waiting times for MH services in Scotland. We used national registers of MH services provided by Public Health Scotland. The results show that waiting times for adults and children increased drastically during the pandemic. This was seen nationally and across most of the administrative regions of Scotland. We find, however, that child and adolescent services were comparatively less impacted by the pandemic than adult services. This is potentially due to prioritisation of paediatric patients, or due to an increasing demand on adult services triggered by the pandemic itself.","Cooke, Lemanska, Livings, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI220660","20220701","COVID-19; Deep Learning; Mental Health; Visualization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33644,""
"Changes in Body Weight, Health Behaviors and Mental Health in Adults with Obesity during the COVID-19 Pandemic","To examine the relationships between body weight changes, health behaviors and mental health in adults with obesity during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between March 1 and November 30, 2021, adults from three obesity practices completed an online survey. The primary outcomes were (1) Ã¢â€°Â¥5% of body weight change since March 2020 and (2) associated health behaviors and mental health factors. The sample (n=Ã¢â‚¬â€°404) was 82.6% female (mean age 52.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, mean BMI 43.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ). Mean weight change was +4.3%. Weight gain Ã¢â€°Â¥5% was reported by 30% of the sample whereas 19% reported Ã¢â€°Â¥5% body weight loss. The degree of both weight gain and weight loss correlated positively with baseline BMI. Eighty percent of the sample reported difficulties with body weight regulation. Those who gained &gt;5% versus those who lost Ã¢â€°Â¥5% body weight were more likely to report higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression; less sleep and exercise; less healthy eating and home-cooked meals; and more takeout foods, comfort foods, fast foods, overeating and binge eating. Weight gain in adults with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with higher baseline BMI, deteriorations in mental health, maladaptive eating behaviors, less physical activity and sleep. Further research is needed to identify effective interventions for healthier minds, behaviors and body weight as the pandemic continues.","Almandoz, Xie, Schellinger, Mathew, Morales Marroquin, Murvelashvili, Khatiwada, Kukreja, McAdams, Messiah","https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23501","20220701","COVID-19; behavior; obesity; weight loss; weight management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33645,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental and physical wellbeing in women with fibromyalgia: a longitudinal mixed-methods study","The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly influenced psychological and physical health worldwide. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the pandemic on women with fibromyalgia. This mixed methods pilot study explored measures of pain severity and interference, as well as pain catastrophizing and level of fibromyalgia impact among women with fibromyalgia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Fibromyalgia patients completed demographic, pain-related, and other validated psychosocial questionnaires prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and then were re-assessed with those questionnaires, as well as a pandemic-related questionnaire assessing the impact of the pandemic on the patients' life, during the pandemic. When comparing data reported before the pandemic to data collected 3-6Ã‚Â months into the pandemic, women with fibromyalgia reported a general worsening of their pain and pain-related symptoms. During the pandemic, pain catastrophizing (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and fibromyalgia impact (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) increased significantly compared to before the pandemic. The increase in pain catastrophizing scores was highly correlated with the impact of the pandemic on the participants' ability to cope with pain and on their mental health. Qualitative analysis corroborated the significant impact of the pandemic on patients' mental health, with the vast majority reporting a worsening of their mood. Other impacted domains included anxiety, level of activity and sleep. Collectively, the pandemic appears to have produced a substantive worsening of pain-related symptomatology among women with fibromyalgia, which should be addressed by targeted interventions.","Lazaridou, Paschali, Vilsmark, Wilkins, Napadow, Edwards","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-022-01840-9","20220630","COVID-19; Catastrophizing; Fibromyalgia; Impact; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33646,""
"Depression, anxiety, and academic performance in COVID-19: a cross-sectional study","Depression and anxiety are common after months of social isolation, and they can have a negative impact on anyone's quality of life if they are not treated promptly and appropriately. The aim of this study was to determine if the change to online modality courses and the presence of depression or anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a difference in the college student's academic achievement. This study was a cross-sectional survey in which we used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Also, we examined the students' perceptions of their academic performance using the Academic Self-Concept Scale (ASCS). A total of 610 students responded to the survey. The average score on the Academic Self-Concept Scale was 2.76Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.35, the students presented a risk of 61.5% for possible depressive disorder and 52.1% for possible generalized anxiety disorder.

"Habituating to pandemic anxiety: Temporal trends of COVID-19 anxiety over sixteen months of COVID-19","The impact of COVID-19 anxiety on mental health and its association with preventive measures is well-established. We aimed to study how COVID-19 anxiety and its dimensions vary over time (16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months) in a sample of individuals (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2717) suffering from mental distress in the pandemic context that participated in a randomized clinical trial testing psychosocial interventions in Brazil. Results showed that pandemic anxiety reduced over time. COVID-19 influences fear of others being infected. Concerns about mental health being affected by COVID-19 were more significant than the fear of being infected or the physical health influenced by COVID-19. A similar temporal effect was not found for burnout, and this effect was not correlated with the number of COVID-related deaths. Habituation to pandemic anxiety or higher intolerance of uncertainty at the beginning of the pandemic is putative mechanisms for the patterns observed in the data. They might have implications for mental health interventions in the pandemic scenario and motivational strategies for prevention.

"Gambling and gaming during COVID-19: The role of mental health and social motives in gambling and gaming problems","The uncertain and stressful global situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause anxiety and impact people's mental health. Simultaneously, social distancing policies have isolated people from their normal social interactions. These societal changes have inevitably influenced gambling and gaming practices, and many people may have turned to betting or gaming as a means of social exchange. This study examined the influence of COVID-19 anxiety on increased mental health problems and their relationship to gambling and gaming problems. The mediating role of social motives for gambling and gaming was also investigated. Finnish adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1530; M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 46.67; 50.33% male) were recruited from a volunteer participant panel to participate in a survey study. COVID-19 anxiety was assessed using a scale adapted from the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Mental health problems were evaluated with the five-item Mental Health Inventory. Gambling problems were measured using the Problem Gambling Severity Index, and gaming problems were measured with the Internet Gaming Disorder Test. Social motives for gaming were evaluated using a single-item measure. Analyses used generalised structural equation modelling. COVID-19 anxiety predicted increased mental health problems, which were associated with heightened gambling and gaming problems. Social motives for gambling and gaming were a significant mediator, suggesting that gambling and gaming problems are emphasized markedly among those who are socially motivated by and involved in such games. Mental health problems experienced during the pandemic and the social properties of games might accentuate gambling and gaming problems.","Savolainen, Vuorinen, Sirola, Oksanen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2022.152331","20220630","COVID-19 anxiety; Gambling problems; Gaming problems; Mental health; Social motives","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33652,""
"Making meaning of irreconcilable destruction of innocence: National humanitarian professionals exposed to cybercrime child sexual exploitation in the Philippines","Sex-cybercrimes against children in the Philippines rose by over 400Ã‚Â % during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic exponentially increasing challenges for carers of children, law enforcers, and prosecutors. Burnout, primary, and secondary traumatic stress are some of the potential mental health risks for child protection carers. How longevity of career is sustained, is unknown. This idiographic study explored both positive and negative interpretations of frontline workers in the Philippines exposed to sex-cybercrimes against children. The protocols of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis guided data collection through semi-structured interviews, transcription, and analysis. One superordinate theme: Irreconcilable destruction of innocence, mercy and justice, and the passionate self; highlights the integral struggle that emerged from these participants' roles in child protection. Their faith philosophy of compassion and forgiveness contrasted with the unfathomable corruption and exploitation they witnessed, and their role in removing child victims from perpetrator family members to serve justice. These internal conflicts necessitated a critical need to self-care against psychological vulnerability. Longevity of career emerged from a co-existence of traumatic distress and psychological growth allowing them to redefine their faith and confront the unfathomable with hope, self-valuing, and purpose. Justice and mercy were juxtaposed integral conflicts threatening the psychological wellbeing of these participants. Ineffective organisational support aggravated their traumatic distress as did the lethargy with which world governments' engage in effective controls against online crimes of child sexual exploitation which has meteorically risen as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic.","McCormack, Lowe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105770","20220630","Betrayal trauma; Cyber child sexual exploitation; Interpretative phenomenological analysis; Justice; Posttraumatic growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33653,""
"Testosterone but not cortisol concentrations in hair correlate between mothers and their prepubertal children under real-life stress conditions","The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that there is an association between the neuroendocrine state, reflected by testosterone and cortisol concentrations in hair, of the mother and her child under difficult real-life stress conditions (COVID-19 pandemic). The research sample consisted of 45 healthy mothers and their prepubertal children (7 - 11 years) of both sexes. The hair samples of mother-child dyads were collected twice to obtain cumulative stress hormone concentrations from April till the end of June and July till the end of September 2020. Thus, 90 mother-child pairs were analyzed. The results showed that both cortisol and testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in the hair of mothers compared to those in their children. The results of cortisol concentrations in hair do not support the hypothesis stated above. In line with our hypothesis are the results of hair testosterone measurements showing a positive correlation between testosterone concentrations in mothers and their children. With respect to the known relationship of testosterone with aggressive behavior, an important finding is that above-mentioned correlation was particularly strong in women with intense subjective feelings of anger in the investigated three months period. Women with strongly prevalent subjective feelings of sadness failed to show a significant correlation between hair cortisol concentrations in mothers and their children, in spite of the known relationship of cortisol to depressive mood. It may be suggested that chronic testosterone secretion reflects the association between the neuroendocrine function of the mother and her child under real-life stress conditions.","Romanova, Karailievova, Garafova, Hlavacova, Oravcova, Jezova","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.105844","20220630","Anger; COVID-19 pandemic; Chronic stress; Distress; Mother-child dyads; Sadness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33654,""

"Mothers' Anxiety to Aggravated Acute Fear of Earthquakes in the City of Zagreb in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Here we present the results of a psychometric investigation on current fear of COVID-19 infection aggravated by the earthquake-induced stress in the group of puerperal women. A group of 16 hospitalized puerperal women that gave birth at Clinical Hospital Sveti Duh in Zagreb, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology were enrolled in retrospective clinical investigation. All the patients delivered during COVID-19 pandemic and experienced devastating earthquake on March 22nd. The women were interviewed on the exact day of the earthquake, 4 hours after the main hit and 6 months after that during second pandemic wave on October of the same year. Women were also questioned about the breastfeeding. The participants provided written informed consent and were interviewed using Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale for evaluation of generalized anxiety disorder. Minimal level of anxiety after the earthquake was shown for 10 mothers with 6 of them having the highest level 4. Mild anxiety was proven for 3 patients, 2 exhibited moderate anxiety with one puerperal women with severe anxiety. One could say that 37.5% of enrolled patients exhibited some degree of anxiety after the earthquake (scoring &gt;5). At second time point during COVID-19 pandemic 13 participants had minimal anxiety score, 2 had mild, while 1 participant had moderate score evaluated by GAD-7 scale (18.8%). At the time of the earthquake 13 participants were breastfeeding (81.3%), while 3 were not due to the personal reasons. 6 months after the earthquake only 7 mothers were breastfeeding (43.8%), while 9 of the participants were feeding their children with adapted milk (56%). Main reason for breastfeeding discontinuation was the stop of milk secretion in the 6 months period after the delivery. To our knowledge, our study is the only national study dealing with mental health problems in a population of puerperal and breastfeeding mothers in a challenging time of COVID-19 pandemic aggravated by devastating earthquake.","Tikvica LuetiÃ„â€¡, Habek, Ã…Â poljar, MiletiÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â klebar","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.370","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33656,""
"Relationship Between Optimism-Pessimism Levels of Mothers and Anxiety Levels of Children in Turkey During COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of the population including children, elderly, and vulnerable people. The aim of this study is to examine, for the first time, the relationship optimism-pessimism levels of mothers and anxiety level of children in turkey during COVID-19 pandemic. Optimism-Pessimism Scale and Preschool Anxiety Scale were used to collect data from a representative sample of 33,362 mothers with children aged 3-6 years. Of the parents, 53% of them reported that their children were slightly anxious due to COVID-19 pandemic. Lower optimism and higher pessimism were significantly related with higher levels of children's anxiety including social, generalized, separation, and overall anxiety as well as obvious fear. Group comparison analysis indicated that very anxious children reported the highest level of different types of anxiety and fear compared to less anxious and not at all anxious children. These findings suggest that mental health of children has been adversely affected during the pandemic and this has important implications for designing and implementing interventions aimed at reducing anxiety levels of children and determining protective and risk factors associated with anxiety in the face of adversity.","Tongar, ÃƒÅ“lkÃƒÂ¼er, YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m, GeÃƒÂ§er, AkgÃƒÂ¼l","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.364","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33657,""
"Anxiety and Treatment Adherence among Glaucoma Patients during COVID-19 Pandemic and Earthquakes in Croatia","The COVID-19 epidemic and earthquakes in Croatia during 2020 suddenly disrupted everyday life and caused psychological disturbances in population. The purpose of the present study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and the level of treatment adherence in glaucoma patients during the pandemic. The paper also aimed to evaluate the correlation between anxiety symptoms, treatment adherence and treatment outcomes in the studied cohort. This cross-sectional study was conducted among primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients at the Department of Ophthalmology, Zagreb University Hospital Center, during one year. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to measure the level of anxiety symptoms. Treatment adherence was estimated by the Culig adherence scale (CAS). Glaucoma damage was determined for each patient from the level of structural and functional impairment of the worse eye, by retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and mean defect (MD), respectively. Statistical analyses were performed, with a P value of less than 0.05 considered being statistically significant. This study included 113 POAG patients, with a mean age of 65.89 years. The median of the BAI total score in all patients was 10. According to the CAS, 60.2% of patients were non-adherent to glaucoma treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak. The BAI total score was significantly negatively related to adherence to local glaucoma treatment (p&lt;0.001). A significant negative association was also observed between adherence and MD (p=0.017), while no correlation was found between adherence and RNFL thickness (p=0.228). Considerable proportion of patients with glaucoma have shown non-adherence to treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety severity was associated with lower adherence, thus indirectly influencing therapeutics outcomes. Special consideration should be given to the strategies promoting mental health and interventions focusing on treatment adherence in glaucoma patients in a time of emergencies.","LeÃ…Â¡in GaÃ„â€¡ina, JandrokoviÃ„â€¡, MarÃ„Âinko, Ã…Â kegro, Vidas Pauk, TomiÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â kegro, BariÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡ Kutija, IvkiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.348","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33658,""
"The Influence of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Frequency of Suicides in Croatia","Suicides are among the leading causes of death in the world and pose a major public health problem. It is not yet entirely clear to what extent the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) affects suicide rates, but is likely to result in an increase in risk factors for suicidal behaviors. The research objective was to compare the suicide rate in 2019 with the suicide rate in 2020 in the Republic of Croatia. A cross-sectional study was conducted for the period from January 2019 to December 2020. The necessary data on persons who committed suicide in the Republic of Croatia in that period were collected in cooperation with the Osijek-Baranja County Police Department. The number of suicides in that period was statistically processed according to demographic characteristics, suicide motives, days of the week and months by years. There was no significant difference in the total number of suicides comparing 2019 and 2020. Observed by months, significantly more suicides were committed during February 2020 compared to February 2019 (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>-test, p=0.04). According to marital status, in 2019 compared to 2020, significantly more suicides were recorded among married persons (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>-test, p&lt;0.001) and among those who were unemployed (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>-test, p&lt;0.001). Persons with the status of veterans committed suicide significantly more often in 2019, compared to 2020 (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>-test, p&lt;0.001) During 2019, compared to 2020, significantly more suicides were committed by persons working in service and trade occupations (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>-test, p=0.001). At the beginning of the pandemic in Croatia, in February 2020, there was a significant increase in suicides compared to 2019, which may indicate that the spread of the pandemic since the end of 2019, with uncertainty and cataclysmic atmosphere, had a negative effect on mental health.","Holik, DumenÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡, Epih, Epih, PopiÃ„â€¡, Matuzalem MarinoviÃ„â€¡, Anton","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.334","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33659,""
"Mental Health amid COVID-19 Pandemic: Appropriate Coping Strategies","COVID-19 is a global public health crisis, and is turning to be a major mental health problem. This review provides a broad overview of mental health situations during COVID-19 pandemic in Africa and globally, while some preventive methods to improve mental health conditions during the pandemic were provided. In the Africa context, various government authorities must ensure the provision and accessibility to mental health care services such as routine preventive information, mental health counseling and self help measures, and social supports such as palliatives, basic needs and special financial assistance to the public during the pandemic. Generally, coping strategies such as personal care-based measures (adequate nutrition, personal hygiene, adequate sleep and rest) activity-based measures (regular physical exercise, learning new tasks and engaging in novel adventures and mindfulness meditation) and behavioral-based measures (avoidance of psychoactive substances, taking breaks from COVID-19-related information, social connectedness and showing supports to others, setting achievable targets, help seeking measures and psychiatrist's visitations, adherence to all COVID-19 preventive measures and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines) are all viable preventive methods against mental health conditions during the pandemic globally. It is recommended that researchers should conduct more studies on the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health status in Africa populations to ensure a valid basis for proper interventions during and post pandemic era. Also, African countries should seek supports and routine guidance from appropriate international health organizations to ensure an updated and frequent mental health care delivery to the public.","Ayenigbara","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.325","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33660,""

A convenience sample of 18 PLWH from a voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) center (August-October 2020) were invited to participate in face-to-face interviews. Inductive content analysis was performed with MAXQDA software. Six themes were identified: COVID-19-related knowledge and preventive practices, misconceptions about COVID-19, fear of seeking health care services, psychosocial effects, limited or inconvenient access to health care services, and the impact of COVID-19 on socioeconomic status. Although participants generally understood COVID-19 preventative measures, some held misconceptions. COVID-19 negatively affected PLWHs' mental health, financial stability, and use of and access to health care services.

"Mental well-being in young people with psychiatric disorders during the early phase of COVID-19 lockdown","Mental health and well-being were seriously impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown especially among young people and people with psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to identify factors associated with well-being in young people with psychiatric disorders, during early phase of COVID-19 lockdown in France. A national cross-sectional online study started on the 8th day of COVID-19 lockdown in France (during March 25-30, 2020). We included young people aged from 16 to 29 who responded to the questionnaire, living and being confined in France, with past or current psychiatric treatment. The questionnaire was accessible online and explored demographics and clinical factors, well-being, stress, situation during lockdown. Well-being was measured by the Warwick-Edinburg Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were carried out. 439 individuals were included with 262 (59.7%) previously treated and 177 (40.3%) currently treated. WEMWBS total score were 42.48 (9.05). Feeling of useful was the most affected dimension. Well-being was positively correlated with: currently working on site, physical activity, abilities to cope with difficulties, family and social supports (p&lt;0.05). It was negatively correlated with: elevated stress level, anxious ruminations, dissatisfaction with information, difficulties to sleep or reorganize daily life, feeling supported by medicines (p&lt;0.05). No individual factor was correlated with well-being. The stepwise linear multivariate model had simple R2 coefficient of determination of 0.535. In the specific population of young people with psychiatric disorders, factors associated with well-being at early stage of lockdown were mainly psychosocial and related to brutal disorganisation of daily life.","Orfeuvre, Franck, Plasse, Haesebaert","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270644","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33663,""
"Racial/Ethnic disparities in drug use during the COVID 19 pandemic: Moderating effects of non-profit substance use disorder service expenditures","The COVID-19 pandemic influenced individuals' anxiety and depression across the United States over a short period, and some Americans relied on drugs for coping. This study examines American adults' drug use trajectories in response to changing anxiety and depression levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating role of substance use disorder (SUD) services provided by non-profit facilities in anxiety/depression-induced drug use. Heterogeneity in such relationships is further explored based on race/ethnicity. This study used a nationally representative sample of 1,176 American adults who reported drug use between May 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Using individual-fixed effects Poisson estimators, the current study empirically modeled drug use changes according to changing anxiety/depression levels. Interaction terms between anxiety/depression levels and per capita spending by non-profit SUD facilities were used to explore the moderating effect of SUD service expenditures. Racial/ethnic disparities were explored in subgroup analyses on non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian samples. We found more frequent drug use in response to elevated anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater spending on SUD service by non-profit facilities at the county level was associated with reduced drug consumption associated with anxiety and depression, with greater benefits for racial/ethnic minorities. Findings provide important policy implications for distributing public funds for non-profit SUD facilities for mitigating SUD risks, especially among racial/ethnic minorities.","Ji, Shin, Rogers, Neese, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270238","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33664,""
"The many facets of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and its inhibitors in disorders of the CNSÃ‚Â - a critical overview","Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a serine protease that cleaves X-proline or X-alanine in the penultimate position. Natural substrates of the enzyme are glucagon-like peptide-1, glucagon inhibiting peptide, glucagon, neuropeptide Y, secretin, substance P, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, endorphins, endomorphins, brain natriuretic peptide, beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone and amyloid peptides as well as some cytokines and chemokines. The enzyme is involved in the maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis and regulation of the immune system. It is expressed in many organs including the brain. DPP4 activity may be effectively depressed by DPP4 inhibitors. Apart from enzyme activity, DPP4 acts as a cell surface (co)receptor, associates with adeosine deaminase, interacts with extracellular matrix, and controls cell migration and differentiation. This review aims at revealing the impact of DPP4 and DPP4 inhibitors for several brain diseases (virus infections affecting the brain, tumours of the CNS, neurological and psychiatric disorders). Special emphasis is given to a possible involvement of DPP4 expressed in the brain.While prominent contributions of extracerebral DPP4 are evident for a majority of diseases discussed herein; a possible role of ""brain"" DPP4 is restricted to brain cancers and Alzheimer disease. For a number of diseases (Covid-19 infection, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and epilepsy), use of DPP4 inhibitors has been shown to have a disease-mitigating effect. However, these beneficial effects should mostly be attributed to the depression of ""peripheral"" DPP4, since currently used DPP4 inhibitors are not able to pass through the intact blood-brain barrier.","Bernstein, Keilhoff, Dobrowolny, Steiner","https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2022-0026","20220630","CD26; SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infection; cancer; central nervous system; enzyme inhibition; neurological and psychiatric disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33665,""
"The Italian COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS): investigation of the COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome and its association with psychological symptoms in an Italian population","The COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS) is a quick and reliable scale assessing dysfunctional coping strategies activated in response to COVID-19 fear and threat. The present study aimed to provide a preliminary validation of the Italian version of the C-19ASS and investigated whether the C-19ASS would mediate the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and psychological outcomes. In Study 1, a community sample of 271 participants completed the Italian version of the C-19ASS and results were subjected to a Principal Component Analysis. In study 2, a community sample of 484 participants completed the Italian version of the C-19ASS and a series of measures assessing COVID-19 anxiety, COVID-19 fear, functional impairment, personality traits, depression, generalized anxiety, and health anxiety. Internal consistency, concurrent and incremental validity were assessed. Path analyses were run. Factor analysis identified a 2-factor solution (i.e., C-19ASS Perseveration, C-19ASS Avoidance) and confirmatory factor analysis suggested a 2-factor model best fits the data. The Italian version of the C-19ASS showed good internal consistency. There was also evidence of convergent validity and incremental validity. Path analyses showed that C-19ASS Perseveration mediates the relationship between emotional stability and psychological symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, and health anxiety). The Italian version of the C-19ASS appears to be a reliable and valid measure of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome. The COVID-19 anxiety syndrome could be a suitable therapeutic target to reduce psychological symptoms typically linked to pandemic events, such as depression generalized anxiety, and health anxiety.","Mansueto, Palmieri, Marino, Caselli, Sassaroli, Ruggiero, NikÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, Spada","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2767","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33666,""
"Remote Research: Resources, Intervention Needs, and Methods in People with Diabetes and Peripheral Neuropathy","Stay-at-home orders associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic were particularly important for older adults with type 2 diabetes, at risk for severe COVID-19 complications.

Technology needs and future telehealth interests were assessed. A glycemic measure (HbA1c), a five-times chair rise, a one-week activity monitor, and surveys (self-efficacy, depression, and balance) were collected. All aspects of the study were completed remotely over email and video/phone call. Twelve participants used computers; nine used phones for study completion. Participants had the following resource needs: connectivity (n = 3), devices (n = 6), and technical support (n = 12). Twenty people expressed interest in participating in future telehealth studies related to balance, exercise, and diabetes management. Methodological considerations were primarily the need for assistance for participants to complete the home HbA1c test, five-time chair rise, wearable activity monitoring, and surveys. Older adults with type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy would need technological and personal assistance (connection, device, guidance) to complete a long-term telehealth intervention.

This study's primary aim was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects the psychosocial impact of T1DM and glycaemic control. During the 2020 lockdown, New South Wales residents were not allowed to leave home except for essential activities. After 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, children with T1DM and their parents were invited to complete online questionnaires. Data on glycaemic control were extracted from the children's clinical records with informed consent. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to analyse the responses. Out of 149 families, 99 responses were received, with 92 participants identified. Comparable proportions of parents (56%) and children (45%) were anxious about the child's increased risk of contracting severe illness due to COVID-19. Most responses from parents and children were closely correlated (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.5, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) There was no consistent effect of lockdown on HbA1c levels, but there was a significant inverse correlation between HbA1c levels and parents' perception of the child having clear and concrete goals for diabetes care (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.25, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The HbA1c also correlated positively with the child feeling depressed and alone with their diabetes when isolated (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.36, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02). Despite life-style changes and a negative psychosocial impact, we did not find objective evidence of any detrimental impact of the lockdown on diabetic control.

"COVID-19 pandemic and telemental health policy reforms","Many patients with mental disorders lack access to care mainly due to provider shortages. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic significantly raised the prevalence of anxiety, depression, substance use disorder and suicidal thoughts among people. Mandated social distancing, and higher incidence of mental disorders increased the demand for Telemental Health (TMH). TMH expands access to care and can be an effective alternative to the costly conventional mental health care. However, there are barriers to the adoption of TMH such as reimbursement challenges, and licensure restrictions.During the COVID-19 pandemic, some policies and regulations changed to address the increase in TMH demand. The federal government increased funding for the new telehealth initiatives and more states legalized the interstate practice for psychologists. Medicare waived telehealth co-payments, reimbursed audio-only visits, and required payment parities between virtual and in-person visits. Nevertheless, Medicare maintained in-person visit prerequisite within the six months prior to the first time only for mental health treatments which can act as a hindrance. Additionally, four more states required telehealth coverage, 33 states required Medicaid plans, and 21 states required private insurers to cover TMH services. Ten states mandated payment parity for private insurers, and four states eliminated cost-sharing for telehealth services. Currently, 21 states are implementing payment parity on a permanent basis.During the pandemic, 78% of Mental health providers integrated TMH services into their practice. Despite the decline in use of telehealth for other health conditions after the pandemic peak, TMH use has remained strong representing 36% of outpatient visits. TMH is beneficial to patients in terms of cost and time saving; thus, the beneficiary regulatory changes should be sustained. Further well-designed studies are needed on the cost-effectiveness of telehealth interventions, and policymakers need to collect more data to decide whether and how to keep these changes permanently for TMH.","Sistani, Rodriguez de Bittner, Shaya","https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2022.2096355","20220630","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health disorders ; Policy reforms; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33670,""

Adolescents with NDD, who already had a high baseline rate of loneliness and mental health difficulties, did not find that this increased during COVID-19 lockdowns. However, adolescents without NDD, who began with a much lower baseline rate, found that this was elevated. There was variability in terms of different types of NDD, with adolescents who had ADHD reporting some positive effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns. These findings highlight the importance of support for adolescents both with NDD and those without as the world emerges out of the pandemic.","Field","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13661","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33671,""
"Nurses' job burnout and its association with work environment, empowerment and psychological stress during COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of this study was to assess the influence of perceived work environment, empowerment and psychological stress on job burnout among nurses working at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses experienced high levels of job burnout during the pandemic, which impacted their mental health and well-being. Studies investigating the influence of work environment, empowerment and stress on burnout during the time of COVID-19 are limited. The study utilized a cross-sectional design. Data were collected from 351 nurses in Oman between January and March 2021. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index, the Conditions of Work Effectiveness Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to assess study variables. About two-thirds of the nurses (65.6%) reported high levels of job burnout. Nurse managers' ability, leadership and support; staffing and resources adequacy; and nurses' access to support were significant factors associated with a reduced level of burnout. Supporting nurses during the crisis, ensuring adequate staffing levels and providing sufficient resources are critical to lower job burnout. Creating a positive and empowered work environment is vital to enhance nurses' retention during the pandemic.","Al Sabei, Al-Rawajfah, AbuAlRub, Labrague, Burney","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.13077","20220630","COVID-19; empowerment; job burnout; nursing; stress; work environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33672,""
"Effect of acute depression associated with COVID-19 infection on health-seeking behaviour: a psychiatrist's personal account and case report","Despite the abundant research on COVID-19-related mental health problems, little attention has been paid to acute depression occurring concurrently with the infection as a neuropsychiatric manifestation. This is important because depression is known to adversely affect help-seeking. Decreased help-seeking is likely to be aggravated by the isolation measures demanded as part of fighting the pandemic, given the disruption of social support networks. To study the effects of acute depression associated with COVID-19 infection on help-seeking behaviour. We present a case report and personal account of a patient psychiatrist who developed a first onset of acute depression as part of COVID-19 infection. Despite being a mental health expert the patient lacked insight into his mood change and its negative effect on help-seeking behaviour, resulting in reliance on a family caregiver to raise the alarm. For those experiencing this complex interaction between COVID-19 infection and the brain, social support will be needed to ensure timely presentation to the healthcare system. Greater attention to behavioural change as part of COVID-19 infection is needed to optimise treatment outcome.","MÃƒÂ¼ller, Broadhead, Simpson, Abas","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.521","20220630","COVID-19; Neuropsychiatry; case report; depression; personal account","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33673,""
"Evaluation of Psychopathological Symptoms, Death Anxiety, Coronavirus Anxiety, Suicide Risk, and Associated Risk Factors Among Hemodialysis Patients in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Hemodialysis (HD) patients have significant mental health problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the psychopathological symptoms, death anxiety, coronavirus anxiety, suicide risk, and associated risk factors in HD patients during COVID-19. This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 15 to October 15, 2021, with 114 HD patients who were undergoing treatment in two central Dialysis Units. It was determined that HD patients had high levels of psychopathological symptoms. Approximately one-third of HD patients (%31.6) had high to very high-level death anxiety. Additionally, of the participants 30.7% had coronavirus anxiety, and also the rate of severe suicide risk was 10.5%. HD patients have experienced various mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial support and interventions need to be planned by the healthcare system and healthcare providers to help HD patients in managing their disease and related mental health problems.","Korkut","https://doi.org/10.1111/1744-9987.13905","20220630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33674,""
"Relationship Between Economic Loss and Anxiety During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Moderating Effects of Knowledge, Gratitude, and Perceived Stress","The prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused individuals to suffer economic losses, in particular due to the implementation of intensive quarantine policies. Economic loss can cause anxiety and has a negative psychological impact on individuals, worsening their mental health and satisfaction with life. We examined the protective and risk factors that can influence the relationship between economic loss and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Panel data from 911 participants were collected in April and May 2020 and again 6 months later. We analyzed the relationship between economic loss and anxiety and investigated the moderating effects of knowledge about COVID-19, gratitude, and perceived stress. Moreover, we investigated whether there were any changes in moderating effects over time or in different demographic groups. In the early stages of the spread of COVID-19, gratitude (<i>B</i> = -0.0211, <i>F</i> = 4.8130, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and perceived stress (<i>B</i> = 0.0278, <i>F</i> = 9.3139, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) had moderating effects on the relationship between economic loss and anxiety. However, after 6 months, only perceived stress had a significant moderating effect (<i>B</i> = 0.0265, <i>F</i> = 7.8734, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). In the early stages of COVID-19, lower levels of gratitude and higher perceived stress led to greater anxiety. In later stages of the prolonged pandemic, only perceived stress had a continued moderating effect on the relationship between economic loss and anxiety. This study suggests that psychological interventions to reduce perceived stress are needed to treat the possible adverse effects of the spread of infectious diseases on mental health.","Jang, Park, Lee, Ryu, Lee, Kim, Kim, Kang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.904449","20220630","COVID-19; anxiety; economic loss; gratitude; knowledge related COVID-19; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33675,""
"Mental Health of Children With Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder and Their Parents During the COVID-19 Lockdown: A National Cross-Sectional Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a real disruption of children's lives. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents seem to be particularly vulnerable to adverse mental health effects due to lockdown policies. This study explores the psychological state of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and their parents during the first lockdown in France. A national prospective cross-sectional parent-reported study was conducted using an online survey disseminated through different social networks of French ADHD associations during the first lockdown. The survey consisted of open-ended, multiple-choice questions and standardized questionnaires such as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the coping self-report questionnaire (Brief COPE) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). A total of 538 parents completed the online survey between the 6th and the 15th of April 2020. These results suggest that most children (65.29%) did not experience a worsening of their behavior but still had pathological levels of hyperactivity (56.47%) and behavioral (57.60%) symptoms at the time of the first lockdown. In addition, some parents (26.27%) showed responses indicating possible major depressive disorder. Positive parental coping strategies were associated with both improved child behavior and fewer parental depressive symptoms. Strengthening parents' coping strategies may be an effective intervention to protect both parents and children with ADHD from the negative psychological effects of lockdown. In times of pandemic, psychological care modalities must evolve to provide quality online interventions for families of children with ADHD.","Bobo, Fongaro, Lin, GÃƒÂ©tin, Gamon, Picot, Purper-Ouakil","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.902245","20220630","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); COVID-19; behavioral symptoms; child; depressive disorder; lockdown; parental coping strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33676,""
"Association of Self-Leadership With Acute Stress Responses and Acute Stress Disorders in Chinese Medics During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","The outbreak of the highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) renders a huge physical and psychological risk to the public, especially to the medics. Additionally, self-leadership has proven to improve self-efficacy and mediate tension, such as nervousness and depression. Therefore, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the association of self-leadership with acute stress responses (ASRs) and acute stress disorders (ASDs) in medics during the COVID-19 epidemic. Self-reported online questionnaires were administered, and 627 participants were finally included. The data were analyzed using the univariate analysis and the logistical regression model to identify whether self-leadership and sociodemographic and epidemic characteristics were associated with mental health, including ASRs and ASDs. Initially, 790 medics responded. Of these, 627 remained after excluding for invalid questionnaires and those with a substantial amount of missing data. Therefore, the participation validity rate was 79.37%. Frontline medical staff (ÃŽÂ² = 0.338; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), possibility of infection among people around the medic being mild (ÃŽÂ² = 0.141; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), subjective estimation of epidemic duration being 3-6 months (ÃŽÂ² = 0.074; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), self-sets (ÃŽÂ² = -0.022; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), self-punishment (ÃŽÂ² = 0.229; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), belief hypothesis and evaluation (ÃŽÂ² = -0.147; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and successful foresight (ÃŽÂ² = 0.105; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were statistically significant with ASRs. Marital status [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =1.813; 95% CI (1.141, 2.881); <i>p</i> = 0.012], being a frontline worker [AOR = 25.760; 95% CI (14.220, 46.667); <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], visiting Hubei in the previous 14 days [AOR = 3.656; 95% CI (1.500, 8.911); <i>p</i> = 0.004], self-punishment [AOR = 1.352; 95% CI (1.180, 1.548); <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], and self-dialogue [AOR = 1.256; 95% CI (11.063, 1.483); <i>p</i> = 0.007] were the risk factors for ASD. Conversely, having frontline medical staff in one's family [AOR = 0.523; 95% CI (0.297, 0.923); <i>p</i> = 0.025], self-sets [AOR = 0.814; 95% CI (0.715, 0.826); <i>p</i> = 0.002], and belief hypothesis and evaluation [AOR = 0.796; 95% CI (0.672, 0.943); <i>p</i> = 0.038] were the protective factors. The special working environment of the COVID-19 epidemic resulted in ASR and ASD. Notably, findings revealed a positive association between ASR symptoms and frontline medical staff, the subjective estimation of epidemic duration, self-punishment, and successful foresight. Nevertheless, marital status, having visited Hubei in the previous 14 days, and self-dialogue were the risk factors accounting for ASD symptoms. Surprisingly, having frontline medical staff in one's family, self-sets, and belief hypothesis and evaluation had potential benefits for ASD symptoms.","Ji, Zhang, Ji, Li, Wang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.836950","20220630","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; acute stress disorders; acute stress response; mental health; self-leadership","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33677,""
"The Mediating Effect of Reassurance-Seeking Behavior on the Influence of Viral Anxiety and Depression on COVID-19 Obsession Among Medical Students","Healthcare workers experienced great psychological burden due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, medical healthcare workers experienced greater instances of insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms than the general population. This study aimed to explore the association between viral anxiety and obsession with COVID-19 among medical students with reassurance-seeking behavior as a mediator. In October 2021, an online survey was conducted among medical students at the University of Ulsan College of Medicine. The clinical characteristics of 162 participants and their responses to rating scales, including stress and anxiety to viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6), Coronavirus Reassurance-Seeking Behaviors Scale (CRBS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), and Obsession with COVID-19 scale were collected. Medical students' obsession with COVID-19 was based on the PHQ-9 (ÃŽÂ² = 0.15, <i>p</i> = 0.01), SAVE-6 (ÃŽÂ² = 0.43, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and CRBS (ÃŽÂ² = 0.38, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) scores (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, <i>F</i> = 39.9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Mediation analysis showed that medical students' viral anxiety and depression directly influenced their obsession with COVID-19, and their reassurance-seeking behavior partially mediated the effects of depression or viral anxiety on obsession with COVID-19. Medical students' viral anxiety and depression may affect their obsession with COVID-19, and reassurance-seeking behaviors may mediate this. Therefore, medical students should adopt adaptive coping strategies to prevent high levels of viral anxiety and recurrent reassurance-seeking behavior.","Kim, Ahn, Lee, Hong, Kim, Park, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.899266","20220630","COVID-19; SAVE-6; medical students; obsession; reassurance-seeking behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33678,""
"Potential Circumstances Associated With Moral Injury and Moral Distress in Healthcare Workers and Public Safety Personnel Across the Globe During COVID-19: A Scoping Review","Healthcare workers (HCWs) and public safety personnel (PSP) across the globe have continued to face ethically and morally challenging situations during the COVID-19 pandemic that increase their risk for the development of moral distress (MD) and moral injury (MI). To date, however, the global circumstances that confer risk for MD and MI in these cohorts have not been systematically explored, nor have the unique circumstances that may exist across countries been explored. Here, we sought to identify and compare, across the globe, potentially morally injurious or distressful events (PMIDEs) in HCWs and PSP during the COVID-19 pandemic. A scoping review was conducted to identify and synthesize global knowledge on PMIDEs in HCWs and select PSP. Six databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and Global Health. A total of 1,412 articles were retrieved, of which 57 articles were included in this review. These articles collectively described the experiences of samples from 19 different countries, which were comprised almost exclusively of HCWs. Given the lack of PSP data, the following results should not be generalized to PSP populations without further research. Using qualitative content analysis, six themes describing circumstances associated with PMIDEs were identified: (1) Risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19; (2) Inability to work on the frontlines; (3) Provision of suboptimal care; (4) Care prioritization and resource allocation; (5) Perceived lack of support and unfair treatment by their organization; and (6) Stigma, discrimination, and abuse. HCWs described a range of emotions related to these PMIDEs, including anxiety, fear, guilt, shame, burnout, anger, and helplessness. Most PMIDE themes appeared to be shared globally, particularly the 'Risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19' and the 'Perceived lack of support and unfair treatment by their organization.' Articles included within the theme of 'Stigma, discrimination, and abuse' represented the smallest global distribution of all PMIDE themes. Overall, the present review provides insight into PMIDEs encountered by HCWs across the globe during COVID-19. Further research is required to differentiate the experience of PSP from HCWs, and to explore the impact of social and cultural factors on the experience of MD and MI.","Xue, Lopes, Ritchie, D'Alessandro, Banfield, McCabe, Heber, Lanius, McKinnon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.863232","20220630"," global; COVID-19; healthcare workers; moral distress; moral injury; public safety personnel; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33679,""

"Determinants of Anxiety in the General Latvian Population During the COVID-19 State of Emergency","The COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictive public health measures have seriously affected mental health of society. Social, psychological, and health-related factors have been linked to anxiety in the general population. We investigate the association of various sociopsychological and health-related determinants of anxiety and identify the predicting factors for anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 state of emergency from in Latvia. We conducted an online survey using a randomized stratified sample of the general adult population in July 2020 for 3 weeks. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). Sociodemographic, health-related, sociopsychological characteristics and suicidality were identified using the structured questionnaire. The statistical analysis included Pearson's chi-square test, <i>post hoc</i> analysis, and binomial logistic regression. The weighted study sample included 2,608 participants. The mean STAY-S score of the total sample was 22.88 Ã‚Â± 12.25. In the total sample, 15.2% (<i>n</i> = 398) of participants were classified as having anxiety. The odds ratio (OR) of having anxiety was higher in females (OR = 2.44; 95% CI 1.75-3.33) and people who had experienced mental health problems in the past (OR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.03-2.04), had suicide attempt in the past (OR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.08-2.59), were worried about their health status due to COVID-19 (OR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.36-1.16), were worried about stigmatization from others if infected with COVID-19 (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.03-1.35), were worried about information regarding COVID-19 from the Internet (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.08-1.43), persons who were lonely (OR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.54-2.34), and persons with negative problem orientation (OR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.06-1.51).

"First-Year College Students' Mental Health in the Post-COVID-19 Era in Guangxi, China: A Study Demands-Resources Model Perspective","The post-COVID-19 era means that the COVID-19 is basically under control; however, the risk of the pandemic still affects people's work, study, and life, physically and psychologically. In this era, due to the more challenges first-year college students face, more attention should be paid to their mental health. An emerging study demands-resources (SD-R) model can explain the influencing mechanism of college students' mental health. This model suggests that study demands increase the risk of student burnout, which results in mental health problems; meanwhile, study resources reduce student burnout and increase student engagement, thus improving mental health. Based on the SD-R model, this study explores the impacts of time pressure, emotional exhaustion, perceived social support, and student engagement on mental health and provides adequate measures to reduce the risk of mental health problems among first-year students. Time pressure, perceived social support, emotional exhaustion, student engagement, and mental health scales were used to investigate 537 first-year students at three universities in Guangxi, China, of whom 290 (54%) were female, and 247 (46%) were male, and the average age was 18.97 Ã‚Â± 1.01. Results indicated that: (1) Moderate scores on time pressure and emotional exhaustion and slightly-above-the-median scores on perceived social support, student engagement, and mental health were found among first-year students in the post-COVID-19 era. (2) Time pressure had a positive relationship with emotional exhaustion and a negative relationship with mental health. (3) Perceived social support was negatively correlated with emotional exhaustion but positively correlated with student engagement, and thus improved mental health. Results of this study with a sample of first-year college students in China support the hypotheses based on the SD-R model. These findings suggest that increasing perceived social support and student engagement while decreasing time pressure and emotional exhaustion may promote mental health among first-year college students.","Wei, Ma, Ye, Nong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.906788","20220701","emotional exhaustion; first-year college students; mental health; perceived social support; student engagement; time pressure; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; China; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33682,""
"Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown on Physical Performance, Sleep Quality, and Health-Related Quality of Life in Professional Youth Soccer Players","In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak led to the declaration of a pandemic. The accompanying restrictions on public life caused a change in the training routines of athletes worldwide. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a 13-week supervised home training program on physical performance, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life in professional youth soccer players during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. Eight professional soccer players (age range 16-19; height: 1.81 Ã‚Â± 0.07 m; body weight: 72.05 Ã‚Â± 6.96 kg) from a Bundesliga team in Germany participated in this study. During the lockdown, they trained 5-6 days per week with home-based training plans and were monitored via tracking apps and video training. To determine the effects of home training, measurements were taken before (March 2020) and after (June 2020) the home training period. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to determine body composition, and an isokinetic strength test and a treadmill step test, including lactate measurements, were used to measure physical performance. Two questionnaires were responded to in order to assess health-related quality of life [Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)] and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). When comparing measurements before and after the home training period, we observed significant increases in the following variables: body weight (72.05 Ã‚Â± 6.96 kg vs. 73.50 Ã‚Â± 6.68 kg, <i>p</i> = 0.034), fat mass (11.99 Ã‚Â± 3.13 % vs. 13.98 Ã‚Â± 3.92 %, <i>p</i> = 0.030), body mass index (22.04 Ã‚Â± 0.85 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 22.49 Ã‚Â± 0.92 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.049), and mental health component summary score (MCS) of the questionnaire SF-36 (53.95 Ã‚Â± 3.47 vs. 58.33 Ã‚Â± 4.50, p = 0.044). Scores on the general health (77.88 Ã‚Â± 14.56 vs. 89.75 Ã‚Â± 13.76, <i>p</i> = 0.025) and mental health (81.50 Ã‚Â± 9.30 vs. 90.00 Ã‚Â± 11.71, <i>p</i> = 0.018) subscales of the SF-36 also increased significantly. The COVID-19 lockdown led to an increase in body composition parameters and showed an improvement in the MCS and scores on the general and mental health subscales of the SF-36. Physical performance and sleep quality could be maintained during the home training period. These observations may help trainers for future training planning during longer interruptions in soccer training.","Keemss, Sieland, Pfab, Banzer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.875767","20220630","COVID-19; adolescents; health-related quality of life; home training; lockdown; physical performance; professional soccer players; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33683,""
"A Narrative Review on Prevention and Early Intervention of Challenging Behaviors in Children with a Special Emphasis on COVID-19 Times","COVID-19 and the measures stemming from efforts to control it have affected the psychosocial wellbeing of children and adolescents. The increasing trend of challenging behavior has exerted further pressure on parents and schools. Understanding socioemotional development and interrelating triggers is the key to management. Early interventions prevent the future threat of mental illness and risky acts. Effective strategies are ones that primarily focus on strengthening parent-child interactions. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on the (i) psychosocial and behavioral impacts of COVID-19 on children/adolescents and (ii) approaches to identify determinants of challenging behaviors as a principal guide to effective interventional strategies for children and their families. Electronic database searches of PubMed, ScienceDirect, Medline, and Scopus were conducted to identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria that address the impact of COVID-19 on behaviors, contributing factors, and management in the context of families/schools. The content of the selected articles was themed under five categories, namely the developmental milestones, the Pyramid Model, the Positive Behavioral Support, the management strategies, and the impact of COVID-19 on children/adolescents' behavior. The present review demonstrates considerable influence of COVID-19 on children and adolescents' behavior and mental wellbeing. It stresses the importance of early family-based interventions focusing on the triggers of challenging behavior. Functional Behavioral Assessment and Behavioral Intervention Plan provide a systematic analysis with a strategic plan that support children's self-regulation and socioemotional intelligence. Regular behavioral screening is vital to promote prevention and early management. Managing behavioral difficulties remains an area of deficit for parents, teachers, and health care providers. With a quality support, parents and schools will be able to clearly characterize the challenging behavior, understand the causes, reinforce parent-child interactions, and consequently, gain the strategic skills required to apply it within natural settings. Timely interventions will limit the risk of future misconduct and mental disorders.","Musa, Dergaa","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S354428","20220630","COVID-19; Pyramid Model; adolescents; children; family-centered intervention; psychosocial wellbeing mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33684,""
"Effects of telehealth intervention for people with dementia and their carers: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies","Interventions delivered using telehealth modalities are becoming standard practice with patient populations around the world, partly because of innovation necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and partly due to improved infrastructure and comfort of providers, patients, and families, through technology. Though increasingly utilized, the effectiveness of telehealth interventions with families with dementia remains unclear. This gives rise to the need for investigation to develop telehealth interventions that are evidence based and not merely convenient tools. This current study is designed to systematically examine the impact and effectiveness of telehealth-delivered psychoeducational and behavioral interventions among persons with dementia and their caregivers. The design combines systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of eight databases were electronically accessed and searched as of November 16, 2021. Experimental studies identifying the results of telehealth interventions for persons with dementia and associated caregivers published in English have been reviewed in this study. Standardized mean differences (SMD) offering 95% confidence intervals (CI) were developed to pool the effect size using a random effects model (in this case, Stata 16.0). The Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB-2) was used to analyze the study's methodological soundness. Nineteen cases met the eligibility criteria (including 1379 persons with dementia and 1339 caregivers). Overall, telehealth interventions demonstrated effects in the expected directions on depression (SMD -0.63; 95% degree of confidence intervals (CI) -0.88 to -0.38, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); and caregivers' perceived competency (SMD 0.27; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.50, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02). There were, however, no statistically significant effects observed on cognitive function or multiple aspects of quality of life for subjects. Telehealth interventions appear to effect a reduction in depression among persons diagnosed with dementia while improving the perceived competency of caregivers. The study's results could be used as evidence of the effectiveness of using telehealth for persons with dementia and their caregivers, including contextualizing where they are used (i.e., long-term care facilities, private homes, etc.), understanding the mechanisms in play (including intervention delivery and systems), and isolating and identifying mediating influences.","Saragih, Tonapa, Porta, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12797","20220630","caregivers; meta-analysis; persons with dementia; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33685,""
"Buprenorphine and naloxone access in pharmacies within high overdose areas of Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic","Buprenorphine and naloxone are first-line medications for people who use opioids (PWUO). Buprenorphine can reduce opioid use and cravings, help withdrawal symptoms, and reduce risk of opioid overdose. Naloxone is a life-saving medication that can be administered to reverse an opioid overdose. Despite the utility of these medications, PWUO face barriers to access these medications. Downtown Los Angeles has high rates, and number, of opioid overdoses which could potentially be reduced by increasing distribution of naloxone and buprenorphine. This study aimed to determine the accessibility of these medications in a major urban city by surveying community pharmacies regarding availability of buprenorphine and naloxone, and ability to dispense naloxone without a prescription. Pharmacies were identified in the Los Angeles downtown area by internet search and consultation with clinicians. Phone calls were made to pharmacies at two separate time points-September 2020 and March 2021 to ask about availability of buprenorphine and naloxone. Results were collected and analyzed to determine percentage of pharmacies that had buprenorphine and/or naloxone in stock, and were able to dispense naloxone without a prescription. Out of the 14 pharmacies identified in the downtown LA zip codes, 13 (92.9%) were able to be reached at either time point. The zip code with one of the highest rates of opioid-related overdose deaths did not have any pharmacies in the area. Most of the pharmacies were chain stores (69.2%). Eight of the 13 (61.5%) pharmacies were stocked and prepared to dispense buprenorphine upon receiving a prescription, and an equivalent number was prepared to dispense naloxone upon patient request, even without a naloxone prescription. All of the independent pharmacies did not have either buprenorphine or naloxone available. There is a large gap in care for pharmacies in high overdose urban zip codes to provide access to medications for PWUO. Unavailability of medication at the pharmacy-level may impede PWUO ability to start or maintain pharmacotherapy treatment. Pharmacies should be incentivized to stock buprenorphine and naloxone and encourage training of pharmacists in harm reduction practices for people who use opioids.","Dadiomov, Bolshakova, Mikhaeilyan, Trotzky-Sirr","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00651-3","20220701","Availability; Buprenorphine; Naloxone; Opioid; Overdose; Pharmacy; Urban; Analgesics, Opioid; Buprenorphine; COVID-19; Drug Overdose; Humans; Los Angeles; Naloxone; Narcotic Antagonists; Opiate Overdose; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Pharmacies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33686,""
"Stigmatization related COVID-19 and PTSD among Chinese graduates","Since COVID-19 broke out worldwide, it had caused extensive public health concerns and psychological distress, including PTSD and stigmatization towards recovered patients and people from high-risk areas. However, the association between PTSD, stigmatization and certain related factors have not been confirmed. Through cluster random sampling, 946 Chinese graduates were investigated from 5 universities in Shanghai at three months after China lifted its coronavirus lockdown. PTSD symptoms were evaluated with PCL-5. Demographic and disease-related characteristics including stigmatization, educational attainment and working position were collected to assess their association with PTSD. 12.4% graduates were reported significant PTSD symptoms in PCL-5 screening with a cut-off of 33. Graduates with a Master's degree (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02) or working position like ""looking for a job"" and ""planning to go abroad"" (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.038) showed severer stigmatization related to COVID-19. Stigmatization towards both patients recovering from COVID-19 and people from high-risk areas had significant association with PTSD symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that stigmatization can explain 5% of variation of PCL-5 scores after controlling gender, age, educational attainments and working position. Graduates who were looking for jobs or preparing to go abroad showed more stigmatization related to COVID-19. There was a positive correlation between stigma against COVID-19 and PTSD symptoms. More attention should be paid to the mental health status of graduates who are preparing to go abroad or looking for jobs.","Gu, Song, Wang, Liu, Zhan, Yan, Jia, Wu, Xu, Liu, Shang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04073-0","20220701","COVID-19; PTSD; Stigmatization; COVID-19; China; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Stereotyping; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33687,""
"Functional decline, long term symptoms and course of frailty at 3-months follow-up in COVID-19 older survivors, a prospective observational cohort study","Aging is one of the most important prognostic factors increasing the risk of clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. However, among patients over 75Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, little is known about post-acute functional decline. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with functional decline 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after COVID-19Ã‚Â onset, to identify long term COVID-19 symptoms and transitions between frailty statesafter COVID-19 onset in older hospitalized patients. This prospective observational study included COVID-19 patients consecutively hospitalized from March to December 2020 in Acute Geriatric Ward in Nantes University Hospital. Functional decline, frailty status and long term symptoms were assessed at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°month follow up. Functional status was assessed using the Activities of Daily Living simplified scale (ADL). Frailty status was evaluated using Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). We performed multivariable analyses to identifyÃ‚Â factors associated with functional decline. Among the 318 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, 198 were alive 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after discharge. At 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, functional decline occurred in 69 (36%) patients. In multivariable analysis, a significant association was found between functional decline and stroke (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4,57, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,003), history of depressive disorder (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3,05, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,016), complications (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,24, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,039), length of stay (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,05, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,025) and age (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,08, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,028). At 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, 75 patients described long-term symptoms (49.0%). Of those with frailty (CFS scores Ã¢â€°Â¥5) at 3-months follow-up, 30% were not frail at baseline. Increasing frailty defined by a worse CFS state between baseline and 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months occurred in 41 patients (26.8%). This study provides evidence that both the severity of the COVID-19 infection and preexisting medical conditions correlates with a functional decline at distance of the infection. This encourages practitioners to establish discharge personalized care plan based on a multidimensional geriatric assessment and in parallel on clinical severity evaluation.","Prampart, Le Gentil, Bureau, Macchi, Leroux, Chapelet, de Decker, Rouaud, Boureau","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03197-y","20220701","Activity of daily living; COVID-19; Frailty; Functional decline; Geriatric care; Long term symptoms; Older patients; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; COVID-19; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic; Follow-Up Studies; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Prospective Studies; Survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33688,""
"Medications Associated with Lower Mortality in a SARS-CoV-2 Positive Cohort of 26,508 Veterans","Many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients take commonly prescribed medications with properties which may affect mortality. Assess if common medications postulated to affect clinical outcomes are associated with mortality in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Observational national cohort analysis. Consecutive 26,508 SARS-CoV-2 positive Veterans (7% of 399,290 tested from March 1 to September 10, 2020) constitute the study cohort. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test date. In patients receiving medications or drug pairs within 2 weeks post-SARS-CoV-2 positive test, 30-day mortality was estimated as relative risk (RR) on the log-binomial scale or using multinomial models with and without adjusting for covariates. The 26,508 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were predominantly male (89%) and White (59%), and 82% were overweight/obese. Medications associated with decreased 30-day mortality risk included the following: metformin (aRR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25-0.43), colchicine, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, vitamin D, antihistamines, alpha-blockers, anti-androgens, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aRR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61-0.78). The effect of co-prescribed medications on 30-day mortality risk revealed the lowest risk for combined statins and metformin (aRR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.15-0.31), followed by ACEi and statins (aRR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.18-0.35), ACEi and metformin (aRR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.17-0.40), antihistamines and NSAIDs (aRR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32-0.52), and in men, combined alpha-blockers and anti-androgens (aRR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.64). In this large national cohort, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with individual or co-prescribed metformin and statins, ACEi and statins (or metformin) and other medications was associated with a markedly decreased 30-day mortality and can likely be continued safely. Clinical trials may assess their therapeutic benefit.","Hunt, Efird, Redding, Thompson, Press, Williams, Hostler, Suzuki","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07701-3","20220629","angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; drug safety; metformin; mortality; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; statins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33689,""

We reviewed and analyzed 206 articles published in 40 peer-reviewed communication journals between January 2020 to April 2021. Our review identified key study characteristics and overall themes and trends in this rapidly expanding field of research. Our review of health communication scholarship during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that health communication scholars have risen to the challenges and interrogated important issues in COVID-19 communication at the individual, group, organizational, and societal levels. We identified important gaps that warrant future research attention including experimental research that seeks to test the causal effects of communication, studies that evaluate communication interventions in under-served populations, research on mental health challenges imposed by the pandemic, and investigations on the promise of emerging communication technologies for supporting pandemic mitigation efforts.","Lin, Nan","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2091916","20220629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33690,""
"Comparison of Mental Health among Japanese Healthcare Workers at Two Points during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The prolonged pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in mental burden among healthcare workers (HCWs). This study aimed to conduct a repeated study to assess changes in psychological concerns among Japanese HCWs. This study is the second survey involving HCWs at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center conducted between November 20, 2020 and December 4, 2020. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and resilience was assessed using the Japanese versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, respectively. The survey included 594 HCWs, comprising 95 physicians, 261 nurses, 150 other co-medical staff, and 88 office workers. Among them, 46 (7.7%) and 152 (25.6%) developed moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared with those in the initial survey conducted 6 months earlier, the resilience score did not change, whereas the anxiety and depression scores improved significantly (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.033, respectively). However, the frequency of HCWs developing moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety or depression did not significantly improve. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that having higher anxiety symptoms was a risk factor for depression symptoms, while older HCWs and those with higher resilience were less likely to develop depression symptoms. Many HCWs still suffer from psychological concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Awano, Oyama, Akiyama, Inomata, Kuse, Tone, Takada, Muto, Fujimoto, Kawakami, Komatsu, Izumo","https://doi.org/10.1272/jnms.JNMS.2022_89-308","20220701","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; healthcare worker; resilience; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health Personnel; Humans; Japan; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33691,""

"The Use of Opioid Analgesia after Surgery: Assessing Postoperative Prescriptions from a Patient and Surgeon Perspective","<b>Purpose:</b> Nonmedical use of prescription opioids continues to be a public health crisis in the United States that disproportionately affects rural communities with diversion of pills from friends and family being the most common source. The primary goal of the study was to identify current opioid prescription practices, and to assess the discrepancy in amount of opioids prescribed by surgeons versus the amount needed post-operatively by patients. Patient factors that may influence postoperative analgesia needs and their management of leftover prescription opioids were also evaluated<b>Methods:</b> Patients Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years-of-age who underwent a surgery between July and December 2018 by the subspecialty departments of Acute Care and General Surgery at a tertiary care facility in the rural Midwest were surveyed at their first post-operative visit to assess their postoperative analgesic needs. Resident and attending surgeons in the above departments were also surveyed to identify different factors that influenced their narcotic prescription practices.<b>Results:</b> Surveys from 252 patients, 12 attending surgeons, and 14 general surgery residents met inclusion criteria. Of patients who received a narcotic prescription, 19.9% did not fill their prescription, 64.1% of whom were &gt;60 years old, and 72.1% resided within an hour of the hospital. Average reported prescription size was 11-40 pills; however, most used more than 5 pills regardless of the type of operation (<i>P</i>=0.59) and history of chronic pain (<i>P</i>=0.07). Inability to call in narcotic prescriptions and patients' distance from care influenced providers' prescription practices, with 77.9% of resident physicians and 68.3% of attending surgeons stating they would prescribe fewer if given the ability to call in a narcotic prescription.<b>Conclusions:</b> Regardless of the operation complexity, a majority of patients required fewer than five opioid pills after discharge and would be willing to return leftover pills. Development of opioid stewardship programs within the healthcare sector may reduce the number of opioids available for diversion and misuse.","Ramwani, Wernberg","https://doi.org/10.3121/cmr.2021.1630","20220701","Burnout; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Physicians; Analgesia; Analgesics, Opioid; Humans; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescriptions; Surgeons; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33693,""
"â€œIs there anything else you would like to tell us?â€: An analysis of language features in text responses to a study on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions have been a major stressor and exacerbated mental health worldwide. Qualitative data play a unique role in documenting mental state, via both language features and content. Within a longitudinal study on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed free responses to the question: â€œIs there anything else you would like to tell us that might be important that we did not ask about?â€ We applied text analysis methods to ask whether individuals who responded to the item differed from non- responders, whether there were associations between language use and psychological status, and to characterize the content of responses and how responses changed over time. 3,655 individuals provided biweekly measures of mental health and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic for 6 months. Of these, 2,497 participants provided at least one free response (9,741 total responses). Response likelihood was influenced by demographic factors and health status: Participants who were male, Asian, Black, or Hispanic were less likely to respond, and odds of responding increased with age and education as well as with a history of physical health conditions. Although mental illness history did not influence an individualâ€™s overall likelihood of responding, it was associated with more negative sentiment, negative word use, and higher usage of first-person singular pronouns. Responses were dynamically influenced by psychological status, such that distress and loneliness were positively associated with an individualsâ€™ likelihood to respond at a given timepoint, and predicted more negativity. Finally, responses were negative in valence overall, exhibited fluctuations linked with external events, and covered a variety of topics, with the most common being mental health and emotion. Our results identify trends in language use during the first year of the pandemic, and suggest that the both the content of responses and overall sentiment are linked to mental health.","Rachel Weger et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E017A-85C-6A7","20220701","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Narrative Research; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; text analysis; sentiment analysis; free response; natural language processing; qualitative; mental illness; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","",33694,""
