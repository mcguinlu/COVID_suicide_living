"Physical, cognitive and mental health impacts of COVID-19 following hospitalisation: a multi-centre prospective cohort study","Background The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, and employment following hospitalisation is poorly understood. Methods PHOSP-COVID is a multi-centre, UK, observational study of adults discharged from hospital with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 involving an assessment between two- and seven-months later including detailed symptom, physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for patient-perceived recovery with age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, and severity of acute illness as co-variates. Cluster analysis was performed using outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognition and physical function. Findings We report findings of 1077 patients discharged in 2020, from the assessment undertaken a median 5 [IQR4 to 6] months later: 36% female, mean age 58 [SD 13] years, 69% white ethnicity, 27% mechanical ventilation, and 50% had at least two co-morbidities. At follow-up only 29% felt fully recovered, 20% had a new disability, and 19% experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with failure to recover were female, middle-age, white ethnicity, two or more co-morbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial and weakly related to acute severity. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment: 1) Very severe (17%), 2) Severe (21%), 3) Moderate with cognitive impairment (17%), 4) Mild (46%), with 3%, 7%, 36% and 43% feeling fully recovered, respectively. Persistent systemic inflammation determined by C-reactive protein was related to cluster severity, but not acute illness severity. Interpretation We identified factors related to recovery from a hospital admission with COVID-19 and four different phenotypes relating to the severity of physical, mental, and cognitive health five months later. The implications for clinical care include the potential to stratify care and the need for a pro-active approach with wide-access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services.

"COVID-19 Survivors' Reports of the Timing, Duration, and Health Impacts of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) Infection","IMPORTANCEPost-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) is a major public health concern. Studies suggest that 1 in 3 infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop PASC, including those without initial symptoms or with mild COVID-19 disease.1, 2

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the timing, duration, and health impacts of PASC reported by a large group of primarily non-hospitalized COVID-19 survivors.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSA survey of 5,163 COVID-19 survivors reporting symptoms for more than 21 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were recruited from Survivor Corps and other online COVID-19 survivor support groups.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESParticipants reported demographic information, as well as the timing, duration, health impacts, and other attributes of PASC. The temporal distribution of symptoms, including average time of onset and duration of symptoms were determined, as well as the perceived distress and impact on ability to work.

RESULTSOn average, participants reported 21.4 symptoms and the number of symptoms ranged from 1 to 93. The most common symptoms were fatigue (79.0%), headache (55.3%), shortness of breath (55.3%), difficulty concentrating (53.6%), cough (49.0%), changed sense of taste (44.9%), diarrhea (43.9%), and muscle or body aches (43.5%). The timing of symptom onset varied and was best described as happening in waves. The longest lasting symptoms on average for all participants (in days) were ""frequently changing"" symptoms (112.0), inability to exercise (106.5), fatigue (101.7), difficulty concentrating (101.1), memory problems (100.8), sadness (99.2), hormone imbalance (99.1), and shortness of breath (96.9). The symptoms that affected ability to work included the relapsing/remitting nature of illness (described by survivors as ""changing symptoms""), inability to concentrate, fatigue, and memory problems, among others. Symptoms causing the greatest level of distress (on scale of 1 ""none"" to 5 ""a great deal"") were extreme pressure at the base of the head (4.4), syncope (4.3), sharp or sudden chest pain (4.2), brain pressure (4.2), headache (4.2), persistent chest pain or pressure (4.1), and bone pain in extremities (4.1).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEPASC is an emerging public health priority characterized by a wide range of changing symptoms, which hinder survivors ability to work. PASC has not been fully characterized and the trajectory of symptoms and long-term outcomes are unknown. There is no treatment for PASC, and survivors report distress in addition to a host of ongoing symptoms. Capturing patient reports of symptoms through open-ended inquiry is a critical first step in accurately and comprehensively characterizing PASC to ensure that medical treatments and management strategies best meet the needs of individual patients and help mitigate health impacts of this new disease.","Natalie Lambert; - Survivor Corps; Sarah A El-Azab; Nathan S Ramrakhiani; Anthony Barisano; Lu Yu; Kaitlyn Taylor; Alvaro Esperanca; Charles A Downs; Heather L Abrahim; Melissa D Pinto; Rana Chakraborty; Jessica L Borelli","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.21254026","20210322","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12382,""
"State Policy and Mental Health Outcomes under COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused enormous damage to physiological health and economic security, especially among racial and ethnic minorities. We examine downstream effects on mental health, how effects vary by race and ethnicity, and the role of existing state-level social policies in softening the pandemic's impact. We analyze an online, multi-wave Census Bureau survey fielded to nearly a million respondents between late April and July 2020. The survey includes questions measuring psychological distress as well as indirect measures of experience with the pandemic. We combine these data with state-level measures of COVID cases, lock-down orders, unemployment filings, and safety net policy. We find significant mental stress among all respondents and a sizeable gap between non-white and white respondents. Adjusting for pandemic experiences eliminates this gap. The effect of losing work due to the pandemic is slightly offset by state policies such as unemployment benefit size and Medicaid expansion. The magnitude of these offsetting effects is similar across racial/ethnic groups. The racialized impacts of the pandemic are exacerbated by inequalities in state policy exemplifying structural racism. If the least generous states matched the policies of the most generous, inequalities caused by the pandemic would be diminished.","Sances, Campbell","https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-9155991","20210325","COVID-19; mental health; race; structural racism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12383,""
"Remote assessment in adults with Autism or ADHD: A service user satisfaction survey","Advances in digital health have enabled clinicians to move away from a reliance on face to face consultation methods towards making use of modern video and web-based conferencing technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote telecommunication methods have become much more common place in mental health settings. The current study sought to investigate whether remote telecommunication methods are preferable to face to face consultations for adults referred to an Autism and ADHD Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, whether there are any differences in preferred consultation methods between adults who were referred for an assessment of Autism as opposed to ADHD. 117 service users who undertook assessment by the ADHD and Autism Service at South West Yorkshire NHS Partnership Foundation Trust from April to September 2020 completed an adapted version of the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). Results demonstrated that service users found remote telecommunication to be useful, effective, reliable and satisfactory. Despite this, almost half of service users stated a general preference for face to face consultations. There was no difference in the choice of methods of contact between Autism and ADHD pathways. Remote telecommunication methods were found to be an acceptable medium of contact for adults who undertook an assessment of Autism and ADHD at an NHS Service during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adamou, Jones, Fullen, Galab, Abbott, Yasmeen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249237","20210325","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12384,""
"Escalating progression of mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a nationwide survey","Since the first nationwide movement control order was implemented on 18 March 2020 in Malaysia to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, to what extent the uncertainty and continuous containment measures have imposed psychological burdens on the population is unknown. This study aimed to measure the level of mental health of the Malaysian public approximately 2 months after the pandemic's onset. Between 12 May and 5 September 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. The target group included all members of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess mental health. There were increased depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms throughout the study period, with the depression rates showing the greatest increase. During the end of the data collection period (4 August-5 September 2020), there were high percentages of reported depressive (59.2%) and anxiety (55.1%) symptoms compared with stress (30.6%) symptoms. Perceived health status was the strongest significant predictor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Individuals with a poorer health perception had higher odds of developing depression (odds ratio [OR] = 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.81-8.47) and anxiety (OR = 3.50; 95%CI 2.37-5.17) compared with those with a higher health perception. By demographics, young people-particularly students, females and people with poor financial conditions-were more vulnerable to mental health symptoms. These findings provide an urgent call for increased attention to detect and provide intervention strategies to combat the increasing rate of mental health problems in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Wong, Alias, Md Fuzi, Omar, Mohamad Nor, Tan, Baranovich, Saari, Hamzah, Cheong, Poon, Ramoo, Che, Myint, Zainuddin, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248916","20210325","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12385,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health and quality of life: Is there any effect? A cross-sectional study of the MENA region","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis that has changed the life of millions globally. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the pandemic on mental health and quality of life among the general population in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. A total of 6142 adults from eighteen countries within the MENA region completed an online questionnaire between May and June 2020. Psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the social and family support impact was assessed with questions from the Perceived Support Scale (PSS). The IES-R mean score was 29.3 (SD = 14.8), corresponding to mild stressful impact with 30.9% reporting severe psychological impact. Most participants (45%-62%) felt horrified, apprehensive, or helpless due to COVID-19. Furthermore, over 40% reported increased stress from work and financial matters. Higher IES-R scores were found among females, participants aged 26-35 years, those with lower educational level, and participants residing in the North Africa region (p&lt;0.005). About 42% reported receiving increased support from family members, 40.5% were paying more attention to their mental health, and over 40% reported spending more time resting since the pandemic started. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild psychological impact while it also encouraged some positive impact on family support and mental health awareness among adults in the MENA region. Clinical interventions targeted towards vulnerable groups such as females and younger adults are needed.","Al Dhaheri, Bataineh, Mohamad, Ajab, Al Marzouqi, Jarrar, Habib-Mourad, Abu Jamous, Ali, Al Sabbah, Hasan, Stojanovska, Hashim, Abd Elhameed, Shaker Obaid, ElFeky, Saleh, Osaili, Cheikh Ismail","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249107","20210325","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12386,""

"Optimism Bias, Pessimism Bias, Magical Beliefs, and Conspiracy Theory Beliefs Related to COVID-19 among the Jordanian Population","The outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has an enormous impact on health. People's views about the virus impact public health efforts to mitigate the pandemic. In this study, we measured misconceptions toward coronavirus in the Jordanian population; 2,544 participants from the Jordanian population completed an online survey. Questions in the survey addressed misconceptions divided into four categories: optimism bias, pessimism bias, magical beliefs, and conspiracy theory beliefs. Questions were evaluated on a Likert scale, and average/median scores for each category were evaluated (&quot;one&quot; high misconception to &quot;five&quot; low misconception). Overall, the most common misconceptions involved conspiracy theory beliefs (2.68 Ã‚Â± 0.83), whereas the least common involved magical beliefs (2.25 Ã‚Â± 0.75). Females had more misconceptions than males (2.52 versus 2.47, P = 0.04). Participants who had attended a lecture on coronavirus, had a higher level of education, worked in a medical field, lived in urban area, or resided in Amman or northern Jordan had fewer misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (2.64, 2.34, 2.33, 2.50 and 2.50 versus 2.53, 2.73, 2.72, 2.64, and 2.66, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). The use of social media appeared to be an important factor influencing the likelihood of false beliefs (2.61 versus 2.38, P &lt; 0.001). Understanding of the factors influencing public perceptions surrounding the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic will help public health authorities improve public understanding and compliance with public health recommendations directed at combatting the virus, including the use of surgical masks, thorough handwashing, and avoiding close contact.

"Evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on supportive care needs, psychological distress and quality of life in UK cancer survivors and their support network","The COVID-19 pandemic is having considerable impact on cancer care, including restricted access to hospital-based care, treatment and psychosocial support. We investigated the impact on unmet needs and psychosocial well-being. One hundred and forty four participants (77% female), including people with cancer and their support networks, were recruited. The most prevalent diagnosis was breast cancer. Forty-one participants recruited pre-pandemic were compared with 103 participants recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured participants' unmet supportive care needs, psychological distress and quality of life. Half of our patient respondents reported unexpected changes to treatment following pandemic onset, with widespread confusion about their longer-term consequences. Although overall need levels have not increased, specific needs have changed in prominence. People with cancer reported significantly reduced anxiety (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.049) and improved quality of life (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.032) following pandemic onset, but support network participants reported reduced quality of life (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009), and non-significantly elevated anxiety, stress and depression. Psychological well-being of people with cancer has not been detrimentally affected by pandemic onset. Reliance on home-based support to compensate for the lost availability of structured healthcare pathways may, however, explain significant and detrimental effects on the well-being and quality of life of people in their support and informal care networks.","Hulbert-Williams, Leslie, Hulbert-Williams, Smith, Howells, Pinato","https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13442","20210325","COVID-19; SARS-Cov-2; cancer; distress; oncology; psychosocial; quality of life; unmet needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12390,""
"Nurses' burnout and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","To examine the nurses' burnout and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We followed the Cochrane criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, CINAHL and pre-print services (medRÃâ€¡iv and PsyArXiv) were searched from January 1 to November 15, 2020 and we removed duplicates. We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity between results was very high. Sixteen studies, including 18,935 nurses met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1%, of depersonalization was 12.6% and of lack of personal accomplishment was 15.2%. The main risk factors that increased nurses' burnout were the following: younger age, decreased social support, low family and colleagues readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of Covid-19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high-risk environment, working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, increased workload and lower level of specialized training regarding COVID-19. Nurses experience high levels of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, while several sociodemographic, social and occupational factors affect this burnout. We found that burnout among nurses is a crucial issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to prepare nurses to cope better with COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of risk factors for burnout could be a significant weapon giving nurses and health care systems the ability to response in a better way against the following COVID-19 waves in the near future.","Galanis, Vraka, Fragkou, Bilali, Kaitelidou","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14839","20210325","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; burnout; mental health; meta-analysis; nurses; prevalence; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12391,""

"Deployable Telescopic Tubular Mechanisms With a Steerable Tongue Depressor Towards Self-Administered Oral Swab","Swabbing tests have proved to be an effective method of diagnosis for a wide range of diseases. Potential occupational health hazards and reliance on healthcare workers during traditional swabbing procedures can be mitigated by self-administered swabs. Hence, we report possible methods to apply closed kinematic chain theory to develop a self-administered viral swab to collect respiratory specimens. The proposed sensorized swab models utilizing hollow polypropylene tubes possess mechanical compliance, simple construction, and inexpensive components. In detail, the adaptation of the slider-crank mechanism combined with concepts of a deployable telescopic tubular mechanical system is explored through four different oral swab designs. A closed kinematic chain on suitable material to create a developable surface allows the translation of simple two-dimensional motion into more complex multi-dimensional motion. These foldable telescopic straws with multiple kirigami cuts minimize components involved in the system as the characteristics are built directly into the material. Further, it offers a possibility to include soft stretchable sensors for realtime performance monitoring. A variety of features were constructed and tested using the concepts above, including 1) tongue depressor and cough/gag reflex deflector; 2) changing the position and orientation of the oral swab when sample collection is in the process; 3) protective cover for the swabbing bud; 4) a combination of the features mentioned above.","Kumar, Nguyen, Kalairaj, Hema, Cai, Huang, Lim, Ren","https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.612959","20210325","COVID-19; low-cost; oropharangeal swab; self-administered; stretchable sensors; swab; tongue depressor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12393,""

Methods Forty-one patientsÃ‚Â who underwent surgery for chronic pancreatitis in the last 24 months were followed up, of which 27 were enrolled. The data were collected telephonically. Pain was assessed using the numeric pain rating (NPR) scale and depression using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9. In patients having recent onset pain during the lockdown, oral tramadol 50 mg and amitryptiline 25 mg were prescribed and reassessed after two weeks. Results Of the 25 pain-free patients in February (pre-lockdown), 14 developed pain of varying intensity during the lockdown and were prescribed medications. Twelve out of 14 patients had very good resolution of pain after two weeks of medication. Conclusions Operated patients with chronic pancreatitis who developedÃ‚Â new-onset depression and painÃ‚Â responded well to low-dose anti-depressants in addition to analgesics.

"Studying Music During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Conditions of Studying and Health-Related Challenges","The coronavirus pandemic affects all areas of life. Performing arts and music studies have also experienced considerable changes, with university closures and a fluctuating return to normal and more limited operations. Prior studies detail the impact of the pandemic on college students, but we do not yet know what specific consequences it has for music students. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on music students' health, practicing behavior, and everyday life. In July 2020, we conducted an online survey of 80 students enrolled in performance and music education programs at a German music university and compared these data with data from a survey of 75 students at the same music university carried out in summer 2019. The survey revealed that the coronavirus pandemic led to a decrease in practicing hours and an increase of stressful thoughts and feelings. Students were mostly satisfied with Corona-measures taken by the university. Of analyzed determinants, only general fear of health problems was identified as a significant predictor of mental health status. Mental health status did not significantly differ between students surveyed in 2019 and 2020.

Depressive and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress were measured using the Italian version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Resilience was measured using the Italian version of the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA). Stressful COVID-19 related life events were explored using a checklist of events derived from the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire (IADQ). After a preliminary panel of linear regressions, mediation was tested using Structural Equation Modeling and inspecting the bootstrapped indirect effects. Afterwards, age was introduced as a mediator of the indirect effect in a moderated mediation analysis. <b>Results:</b> Twenty one thousand three hundred and thirty four subjects completed the questionnaire, 17,178 (80.52%) were female, 748 (3.5%) were &gt;60 years old. In the whole sample, the presence of any stressful event was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress. Resilience mediated the effects of stressful COVID-19-related events on depressive and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress. The moderated mediation analysis revealed that age moderated the mediation effect of Resilience between the presence of a stressful event and the selected outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Taken together, our results show that age moderates the mediating effect of Resilience in the relationship between COVID-19-related stressful events and depressive and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress. Older adults' Resilience was less influenced by stressful events, and this could be one of the reasons accounting for the better mental health outcomes observed in the older age.","Rossi, Jannini, Socci, Pacitti, Lorenzo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.635832","20210325","COVID-19; mental health; old age; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12396,""

"Caring for caregivers: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those responsible for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes","This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on guardians of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. An online survey was performed to assess the prevalence of pandemic-related emotional burden, mental health disorders and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers of children and adolescents with diabetes under the age of 18 and caregivers of youth without diabetes for the non-diabetes group were invited to participate. For the primary outcome, mental health disorders were evaluated using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), while pandemic-related emotional burden and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care were evaluated in different domains with specific questions. For analyses, a hierarchical testing strategy was performed. A total of 764 participants were included in the study. Regarding the pandemic period, caregivers of youth with type 1 diabetes endorsed significantly more pandemic-related emotional burden for both themselves (OR 1.67; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.53) and for their child (OR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.54 to 3.38) when compared to the non-diabetes group. The emotional burden evaluation on different age ranges showed that the two groups were similar when the dependent youth was younger than 6Ã‚Â years. Moreover, a positive screening for mental health disorders during social distancing was higher in the diabetes group compared to the non-diabetes group (OR 2.43; 95% CI, 1.70 to 3.47), particularly in those aged under 12Ã‚Â years old. There was no difference between groups in mental health disorders among caregivers of adolescents older than 12Ã‚Â years. Our results allow to conclude that concern, burden and mental health disorders can be present in caregivers of youth with diabetes, and behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may enhance this situation.","Alessi, de Oliveira, Feiden, Schaan, Telo","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85874-3","20210325","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12398,""

"Psychological experiences of healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID-19","The upsurge of COVID-19 has caused numerous psycho-social challenges for healthcare professionals because of its ability to spread rapidly in the community and high mortality rate. The seriousness of the disease has led many healthcare professionals plagued by stigma as well as discrimination. In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated. A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants. No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.06, 95% CI 1.25-3.39), stigmatization (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.19, 95% CI 1.29-3.72), and heavy workload (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.45, 95% CI 1.53-3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.53, 95% CI 1.56-4.09) and heavy workload (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.94. 95% CI 1.22-3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety. Fear of being infected and distress caused by fear of spreading it among family members, stigmatization, poor self-confidence, poor occupational safety and heavy workload are vital risk factors that need to be considered in future psychological support services designed for the healthcare professionals in unprecedented outbreaks like COVID-19.","Perera, Wickramarachchi, Samanmalie, Hettiarachchi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00526-5","20210325","COVID-19; Healthcare professionals; Psychological health; Self-confidence; Sri Lanka; Stigmatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12400,""
"Mental health and preventive behaviour of pregnant women in China during the early phase of the COVID-19 period","The COVID-19 has caused significant toll over the globe. Pregnant women are at risk of infection. The present study examined the frequency of washing hands with soap and wearing face mask when going out, prevalence of depression and anxiety, and identified their associated factors among pregnant women during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 24 February and 3 March 2020. A total of 15 428 pregnant women who were using maternal health care services in China completed a questionnaire which assessed their socio-demographic and pregnancy-related characteristics, contextual, cognitive and social factors related to COVID-19, frequency of washing hands and wearing face masks, and depression and anxiety. Logistics regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors of preventive behaviours and mental health. The prevalence of probable anxiety and depression was 28.2% and 43.6% respectively. 19.8% reported always wearing face mask when going out, and 19.1% reported washing hands with soap for more than 10 times per day. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that older age was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.42-0.67) and higher frequency of washing hands (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.57-3.40). Higher level of education level was associated with probable depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31-1.45) and higher frequency of wearing face mask (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50-1.57). After adjusting for significant socio-demographic and pregnancy-related factors, place of residence being locked down (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.10-1.11), being quarantined (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.42-1.57), personally knowing someone being infected with COVID-19 (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.80-1.92), perception that COVID-19 would pose long term physical harm to human (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.25-1.28) were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, while the perception that the disease will be under control in the coming month was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.59-0.63) and lower tendency of always wearing face mask (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85). Social support was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.86-0,87) and higher frequency of washing hands (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.06). The mental health and preventive behaviours of pregnant women during COVID-19 outbreak was associated with a range of socio-demographic, pregnancy-related, contextual, cognitive and social factors. Interventions to mitigate their mental health problems and to promote preventive behaviours are highly warranted.","Wang, Mo, Song, Di, Zhou, Zhao, Wu, Tian, Qiu, Xia, Wang, Li, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-021-00825-4","20210325","Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Depression; Mental health; Personal preventive behaviour; Pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12401,""
"Disaster management of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a suboptimal response to this threatening global disaster, including the response to the psychological impact. Both the economic hardship and the continuous media coverage of alarming news have exacerbated this effect which also includes increased domestic violence. To address this important aspect of disaster management and provide recommendations on how to mitigate these effects. This is a narrative review written by three experts in community medicine, disaster medicine and psychiatry reflecting the interdisciplinary approach in managing disasters. Selected important papers, personal published papers, PUBMED articles and media news related to the disaster management of the psychological effects of COVID-19 pandemic were collected over the last year, critically appraised and used in writing this manuscript. The COVID-19 pandemic causes major emotional distress. Lack of effective treatments and availability of the current vaccines for this virus increases the fear of being infected and infecting others. Negative emotions are common and are related to adjustment but may progress in the long term to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome. The COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact on mental health. The most common distress reactions include anxiety, insomnia, perception of insecurity, anger, fear of illness, and risky behaviors. Patients having mental disorders are vulnerable during the pandemic because of (1) somatic vulnerability, (2) cognitive and behavioral vulnerability, (3) psychosocial vulnerability, and (4) disruption to psychiatric care. Psychiatric wards, which are commonly separate from main hospitals, should be included in the disaster management plans. Acute care physicians carry the psychological and ethical impact of difficult triage decisions when ending the support of some patients to save others. A combination of fear and guilt may overcome normal human tolerance levels in vulnerable health workers. The moral injuries can be carried for a long time. Addressing the psychological effects is an essential component of disaster management of infectious pandemics. This should be implemented through the whole spectrum of disaster management including preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.","Sheek-Hussein, Abu-Zidan, Stip","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12245-021-00342-z","20210325","COVID-19; Distress; Domestic violence; Mental stress; New Corona virus; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12402,""

"Promoting youth mental health during COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study spanning pre- and post-pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced many novel stressors into the lives of youth. Identifying factors that protect against the onset of psychopathology in the face of these pandemic-related stressors is critical. We examine a wide range of factors that may protect youth from developing psychopathology during the pandemic. We assessed pandemic-related stressors, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and potentially protective factors in a longitudinal sample of children and adolescents (N=224, 7-15 years) assessed prior to the pandemic, during the stay-at-home orders, and six months later. We evaluate how family behaviors during the stay-at-home orders are related to changes in psychopathology relative to the assessment prior to the pandemic, identify factors that moderate the association of pandemic-related stressors with psychopathology, and determine whether these associations vary by age. Higher exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with increases in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms and this association persisted six months later. Greater engagement in exercise, a structured routine, greater time spent in nature, and less screen time, were associated with reduced internalizing and externalizing problems. The association between pandemic-related stressors and increases in psychopathology was significantly lower for youths with limited passive screen time, and marginally so for those with more time outdoors. The strong association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing symptoms was absent among children, but not adolescents, with lower news media consumption related to the pandemic both concurrently and prospectively. We provide insight into simple and practical steps that families can take that may promote resilience against mental health problems in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic and protect against psychopathology following pandemic-related stressors.","Maya L.

"On the factorial structure of autobiographical recollection","Autobiographical Recollection Test (ART; Berntsen et al., 2019) is a self-report measure of individual differences in autobiographical recollection that comprises seven subdimensions with sizeable overlaps. We examined the second-order and bifactor models of the ART scores using its Turkish translation (N = 716). Results showed that the ART scores are best represented with an incomplete bifactor model in which a general factor captures autobiographical recollection experience in general, and three specific factors capture additional individual differences in Reliving, Rehearsal, and Life-story relevance. By partitioning the variance between general and specific factors of autobiographical recollection, our analyses informed the factorial structure of the individuals` impressions about their autobiographical recollection as an individual difference variable and the correct use and interpretation of the ART total and subscale scores. Next, we examined the relations of the general and unique factors with episodic memory and depression scores (N = 524) and discussed the findings.","Berivan Ece et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-4E7-A0F","20210326","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Psychometrics; autobiographical recollection; bifactor models; autobiographical memory; autobiographical memory scales; individual differences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12405,""
"Sexual Desire in the Time of COVID-19: How COVID-Related Stressors are Associated with Sexual Desire in Romantic Relationships","The COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures caused widespread social and economic disruptions, resulting in spikes in unemployment and financial instability, along with drastic changes to people's ability to feel socially connected. These changes could have implications on peopleâ€™s sex lives as external stressors, like those introduced amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, are risk factors for depressive symptoms, which are associated with lower levels of sexual desire. The current research (N = 4,993) examined whether external stressors brought on by COVID-19 were associated with sexual desire among people in relationships (Studies 1-2), and whether this association was, in part, due to reports of depressive symptoms (Study 2). In the period immediately following the onset of the pandemic, more financial concern (Study 1) and worry (Study 2) were associated with higher sexual desire, while other factors, like stress (Studies 1-2), were associated with lower desire. We also followed a subset of participants every two weeks during the initial stages of the pandemic and at times when people reported greater stress, loneliness, financial strain, or worry than their average, they reported greater depressive symptoms, which, was in turn, associated with lower sexual desire. Results suggest that the social isolation and stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has mixed associations with sexual desire at the onset of the pandemic. But over time, when people report heightened COVID-related stressors, like stress and loneliness, they tend to report lower sexual desire for their partner, in part because these stressors are associated with more depressive symptoms.","Rhonda Nicole Balzarini et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D4-254-C2F","20210326","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; sexual desire; romantic relationships; covid-19; stress; financial strain; loneliness","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-26","",12406,""
