"Impact on Mental Health of students due to restriction caused by COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional study","Abstract Background: The goal of the study was to investigate fear, depression and anxiety symptoms among students of India due to COVID-19 pandemic and its restriction. Method: The cross-sectional web-based research was conducted between mid-November and mid-December 2020 with the objective of understanding the psychological and behavioral consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on students due to the constraint of forced control. The study included a) socio-demographic questions such as age, gender, degree enrolled and any member of the family infected with COVID-19, b) psychometric scales evaluating the psychological and behavioral impact caused by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as fear of the COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), depression by the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, and anxiety by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Results: Total number of 324 students participated in this study in which 44.4% were male and 55.6% were female. Fear of COVID-19 scale showed 68.8% student had high fear among students, 24.4% had moderate to severe depression and 51.5% had moderate to severe anxiety. The correlation between fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19s) and Generalized Anxiety scale (GAD-7) was found to be 0.474 and 0.492 was found between fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19s) scale and brief patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) Conclusion: This research concludes that there is a very strong fear of COVID-19 among students, along with anxiety and depression. This study also concludes that the fear of the COVID-19 scale and the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales have a strong positive correlation.","Amar Prashad Chaudhary; Narayan Sah Sonar; Moumita Banerjee; Jamuna TR; Shailesh Yadav","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21250695","20210209","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10398,""
"High School Sports During the CoVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact of Sport Participation on the Health of Adolescents","Context: During the fall of 2020, some high schools across the US allowed their students to participate in interscholastic sports while others cancelled or postponed their sport programs due to concerns regarding CoVID19 transmission. It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of student athletes. Objective: Identify the impact of playing a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic on the health of student athletes. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Sample recruited via email. Patients or Other Participants: 559 Wisconsin high school athletes (age=15.7+1.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP). Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch. RESULTS: PLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p<0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p<0.001). PLY athletes reported higher (better) PFABS scores (mean: [95%CI]), (PLY=23.2[22.0,24.5], DNP=16.4[15.0,17.8], p <0.001) and higher (better) PedsQL total scores (PLY=88.4[85.9,90.9], DNP=79.6[76.8,82.4], p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who played a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as higher physical activity and quality of life scores compared to adolescent athletes who did not play a sport.","Timothy McGuine; Kevin Biese; Allison Schwarz; Claudia Reardon; Scott Hetzel; M.

"Estimation of real-infection and immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in Indian populations","Infection born by Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has swept the world within a time of a few months. It has created a devastating effect on humanity with social and economic depressions. Europe and America were the hardest hit continents. India has also lost several lives, making the country fourth most deadly worldwide. However, the infection and death rate per million and the case fatality ratio in India were substantially lower than many of the developed nations. Several factors have been proposed including the genetics. One of the important facts is that a large chunk of Indian population is asymptomatic to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the real infection in India is much higher than the reported number of cases. Therefore, the majority of people are already immune in the country. To understand the dynamics of real infection as well as level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, we have performed antibody testing (serosurveillance) in the urban region of fourteen Indian districts encompassing six states. In our survey, the seroprevalence frequency varied between 0.01-0.48, suggesting high variability of viral transmission among states. We also found out that the cases reported by the Government were several fold lower than the real infection. This discrepancy is majorly driven by a higher number of asymptomatic cases. Overall, we suggest that with the high level of immunity developed against SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of the districts, it is less likely to have a second wave in India.","Prajjval Pratap Singh; Rakesh Tamang; Manoj Shukla; Abhishek Pathak; Anshika Srivastava; Pranav Gupta; Alay Bhatt; Abhishek K.

"Integrating youth mental health into cash transfer programmes in response to the COVID-19 crisis in low-income and middle-income countries","Summary Social protection measures can play an important part in securing livelihoods and in mitigating short-term and long-term economic, social, and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic  In particular, cash transfer programmes are currently being adapted or expanded in various low-income and middle-income countries to support individuals and families during the pandemic  We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15â€“24 years), including those with mental health conditions  Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences  They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic  To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises  Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage","Bauer, Annette, Garman, Emily, McDaid, David, Avendano, Mauricio, Hessel, Philipp, DÃ­az, Yadira, Araya, Ricardo, Lund, Crick, Malvasi, Paulo, Matijasevich, Alicia, Park, A.

In this article, which is part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we describe the steps needed to improve outcomes, focusing on three strategies. We argue for transforming the behavioral health system to meet people where they are, decriminalizing mental illness and substance use disorders to facilitate recovery, and raising awareness of social context and social needs as essential to effective care. We call for supporting structures in the workforce and structures of accountability, outcome measurement, and more generous financing of behavioral health care.

"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures on emergency plastic and reconstructive surgery presentations","BACKGROUND: In Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe social disruptions, including restrictions to the movement of people. Healthcare centres around the world have seen changes in the nature of injuries acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic; we therefore hypothesize that social isolation measures have changed the pattern of plastic and reconstructive surgery presentations. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was designed comparing patient presentations during the enforced COVID-19 lockdown to two previous periods. All emergency referrals requiring operative intervention by the plastic and reconstructive surgery unit of our institution were included. Patient demographics, place and mechanism of injury, drug and alcohol involvement, delays to presentation, length of admission and complication rates were collected. RESULTS: Demographics and complication rates were similar across all groups. A 31.8% reduction in total number of emergency cases was seen during the lockdown period. Increase in do-it-yourself injuries (P = 0.001), bicycle injuries (P = 0.001) and injuries acquired via substance abuse (P = 0.041) was observed. Head and neck injuries, mostly due to animal bites and falls, were also more prevalent compared to the same period the previous year (P = 0.007). As expected, over 80% of plastic surgery operations during the COVID-19 period were due to injuries acquired at home, a significant increase compared to previous periods. CONCLUSION: Despite changes in the pattern of presentations requiring plastic and reconstructive emergency surgery, traumatic injuries continued to occur during the pandemic.

"A SWOT analysis of Italian medical curricular adaptations to the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationwide survey of medical school leaders","There is a growing literature on how medical education adapts to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a need to examine the facilitators and barriers of these adaptations. This study explores the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of how Italian medical schools adapted their curricula to the COVID -19 pandemic. The authors conducted an online survey of directors of medical curricula in Italy. Free-text responses to open-ended questions about curricular adaptations and reflections on these adaptations were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Twenty out of 60 Italian medical school directors completed the survey. Strengths identified were rapid responses and a spirit of cooperation. Weaknesses included dependency on clinical facilities, teachers' limited skills to use technology, and lack of mental health support for staff. Opportunities highlighted were clear government rules, new ways of teaching and a renewed focus on underrepresented topics. Threats expressed included impaired relationships, difficulties related to online assessment, lack of IT access, and legal and insurance issues. This study, in documenting the curricular adaptations of Italian medical schools during an active global pandemic, and recording the perspectives of medical education leaders, offers important lessons for the future.","Consorti, Kanter, Basili, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159X.2021.1877266","20210208","International medical education; change; curriculum; evaluation; undergraduate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10438,""
"Curved-crease origami face shields for infection control","The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). Face shields are an important component of PPE for front-line workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing protection of the face from splashes and sprays of virus-containing fluids. Existing face shield designs and manufacturing procedures may not allow for production and distribution of face shields in sufficient volume to meet global demand, particularly in Low and Middle-Income countries. This paper presents a simple, fast, and cost-effective curved-crease origami technique for transforming flat sheets of flexible plastic material into face shields for infection control. It is further shown that the design could be produced using a variety of manufacturing methods, ranging from manual techniques to high-volume die-cutting and creasing. This demonstrates the potential for the design to be applied in a variety of contexts depending on available materials, manufacturing capabilities and labour. An easily implemented and flexible physical-digital parametric design methodology for rapidly exploring and refining variations on the design is presented, potentially allowing others to adapt the design to accommodate a wide range of ergonomic and protection requirements.","Bukauskas, Koronaki, Lee, Ott, Al Asali, Jalia, Bashford, GatÃƒÂ³o, Newman, Gattas, Shah, Ramage","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245737","20210208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10439,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychological Distress of Medical Students: A Japanese Cross-Sectional Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected medical education. However, little data are available about medical students' distress during the pandemic. This study aimed to provide details on how medical students had been affected by the pandemic. Cross-sectional study. 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The questions included how their mental status had changed before and after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). 65.9% (473/717) participated in the study. 29.8% (141/473) reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education could have been ineffective compared with in-person learning. Participant's subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (p &lt;.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.19 - 3.28), as did those who requested food aid and mental health care resources (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16 - 3.44; OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07 - 6.15, respectively). Given our findings, the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we recommend educators to inform learners that online learning is non-inferior to in-person learning, which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety.","Nishimura, Ochi, Tokumasu, Obika, Hagiya, Kataoka, Otsuka","https://doi.org/10.2196/25232","20210208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10440,""
"Telemedicine in Pediatrics: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials","Telemedicine modalities, such as video conferencing, are used by healthcare providers to remotely deliver healthcare to patients. The use of telemedicine in pediatrics has increased in recent years to improve healthcare access, optimize disease management, monitor progress of health conditions, and minimize exposure to sick patients during pandemics, such as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). To systematically evaluate the most recent evidence for the feasibility, accessibility, patient and provider satisfaction, and treatment outcomes related to the use of telemedicine across all health conditions in the pediatric populations. Studies were identified through PubMed database on May 10, 2020. We followed the guidelines for the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Included studies were randomized control trials from the last ten years that focused on telemedicine approaches as a study intervention in general or sub-specialty pediatric care. Title and abstracts were independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. Full texts were retrieved and independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. A standardized form including publication title, first author's name, publication year, participants' characteristics, study design, technology approach used, intervention characteristics, study goal, and study findings was used for data extraction. Eleven articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All studies were categorized as either randomized control trials (8/11) or cluster randomized trials (3/11). Number of participants in each study ranged from 22 to 400. Health conditions ranged from obesity (3/11), asthma (2/11), mental health (1/11), otitis media (1/11), skin conditions (1/11), type I diabetes (1/11), ADHD (1/11), and cystic fibrosis related pancreatic insufficiency (1/11). Telemedicine approaches used included traditional patient and doctor visits conducted via videoconferencing (5/11), smartphone-based interventions (3/11), telephone counseling (2/11), and telemedicine screening visits (1/11). Telemedicine interventions in all included studies showed comparable or improved outcomes related to symptom management, quality of life, satisfaction, medication adherence, visit completion rates, and disease progression, compared to control groups. Although more research is needed, evidence from this review may suggest that telemedicine use in general and subspecialty pediatric care is comparable and occasionally more beneficial, compared to in person visits. Patients, healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers may benefit from utilizing telemedicine alongside traditional in person healthcare evaluations. Future research should emphasize improving access to care and cost effectiveness and eliminating barriers of telemedicine use to maximize its potential.

"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Immediately Increases Burnout Symptoms in ICU Professionals: A Longitudinal Cohort Study","ICU professionals are at risk of developing burnout due to coronavirus disease 2019. This study assesses the prevalence and incidence of burnout symptoms and moral distress in ICU professionals before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. This is a longitudinal open cohort study. Five ICUs based in a single university medical center plus another adult ICU based on a separate teaching hospital in the Netherlands. All ICU professionals were sent a baseline survey in October-December 2019 (252 respondents, response rate: 53%), and a follow-up survey was sent in May-June 2020 (233 respondents, response rate: 50%). None. Burnout symptoms and moral distress measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Moral Distress Scale, respectively. The prevalence of burnout symptoms was 23.0% before coronavirus disease 2019 and 36.1% at postpeak time, with higher rates in nurses (38.0%) than in physicians (28.6%). Reversely, the incidence rate of new burnout cases among physicians was higher (26.7%) than nurses (21.9%). Higher prevalence of burnout symptoms was observed in the postpeak coronavirus disease 2019 period (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.32-2.53), for nurses (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.04), for professionals working overtime (odds ratio 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48-3.02), and for professionals directly engaged with care for coronavirus disease 2019 patients (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.35-2.60). Physicians were more likely than nurses to develop burnout symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.06-12.21). This study shows that overburdening of ICU professionals during an extended period of time leads to symptoms of burnout. Working long hours and under conditions of scarcity of staff, time, and resources comes at the prize of ICU professionals' mental health.","Kok, van Gurp, Teerenstra, van der Hoeven, Fuchs, Hoedemaekers, Zegers","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000004865","20210208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10444,""
"The effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on people with epilepsy (PwE): an online survey-based study","During the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the whole world faced an unusual health emergency. Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as Epilepsy, is being neglected. In this survey, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of people with Epilepsy (PwE) and to identify their risk factors for seizure worsening to direct better future medical care. We administered a web-based survey (submitted on August 5, 2020). It included socio-demographic, Epilepsy-related, and psychometric data (The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items(DASS21) and TheÃ‚Â Pittsburgh Sleep Quality IndexÃ‚Â (PSQI). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. We collected responses from an online survey of PwE during the pandemic. Out of 151 responders, 71 patients complained of issues related to Epilepsy management and all of whom reached the treating physician and solved their problems. Sleep quality was compromised in 84 patients (55.6%). Two-thirds of the patients in our cohort (66.2%) reported depression, 72.2% reported anxiety, and 75.5% reported stress. Eight patients (5.3%) got COVID-19 infection, and only one patient suffered from mild worsening of the seizure. The main concerns were shortage of medications for 46 (30.5%) patients, getting Coronavirus infection for 67 (44.4%) patients, and seizure worsening for 32 (21.3%) patients. Thirty-five patients (23.2%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by retirement or jobless state, having moderate or severe stress, poor sleep quality, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), fear of getting COVID-19 infection, fear of worsening of seizures, or shortage of medication. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced worsening of their seizures. This unusual, challenging experience clarifies the urgent need to establish telemedicine services and home-based management of Epilepsy, including ambulatory EEG, home video, and medication delivery to patients' homes to provide continuous medical care.","Abokalawa, Ahmad, Al-Hashel, Hassan, Arabi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13760-021-01609-1","20210208","COVID-19; Epilepsy; Pandemic; Seizure worsening; Sleep; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10445,""

"Trajectories of Mental Distress Among US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Cross-sectional studies have found that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected population-level mental health. Longitudinal studies are necessary to examine trajectories of change in mental health over time and identify sociodemographic groups at risk for persistent distress. To examine the trajectories of mental distress between March 10 and August 4, 2020, a key period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included 6,901 adults from the nationally representative Understanding America Study, surveyed at baseline between March 10 and 31, 2020, with nine follow-up assessments between April 1 and August 4, 2020. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between date and self-reported mental distress (measured with the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire) among U.S. adults overall and among sociodemographic subgroups defined by sex, age, race/ethnicity, household structure, federal poverty line, and census region. Compared to March 11, the odds of mental distress among U.S. adults overall were 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.65-2.07) times higher on April 1 and 1.92 (95% CI = 1.62-2.28) times higher on May 1; by August 1, the odds of mental distress had returned to levels comparable to March 11 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.96).

"The Combined Impact of Gender and Age on Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms, Depression, and Insomnia During COVID-19 Outbreak in China","The mental health problems might have been increased owing to the COVID-19 pandemic with the commencement of the year 2020, therefore, an epidemiological survey appraising the burden of mental health issues among the general population is imperative. This cross-sectional study attempts to reveal the underlying mental health conditions, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS), depression, and insomnia, relating to the pandemic situation, and to further examine the combined effects of gender and age on the COVID-19 related mental health consequences. An online survey was conducted among 2,992 adults in China from February 1st 2020 to February 10th 2020. The study uses binary logistic regression to analyze the potential factors associated with PTSD, depression, and insomnia. The results indicate that the prevalence of PTSS, depression, and insomnia are 19.5, 26.9, and 19.6% respectively during the COVID-19. Men and women show different rates of PTSS and depression, whereas no insomnia is found in both males and females. The females above 50 years of age have a lower level of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.448, 95%CI: 0.220-0.911, Cohen's d = -0.443) as compared with females aged 18-25; while the highest effect sizes for PTSS (OR = 2.846, 95%CI: 1.725-4.695, Cohen's d = 0.537) and the depression (OR = 2.024, 95%CI: 1.317-3.111, Cohen's d = 0.314) are seen in males aged 26 to 30. Besides gender, education, living conditions, direct exposure to COVID-19, the post mental and the physical health condition is related to PTSS, depression, and insomnia.

"Development of Psychological Problems Among Adolescents During School Closures Because of the COVID-19 Lockdown Phase in Italy: A Cross-Sectional Survey","<b>Background:</b> Previous studies have shown that during COVID-19 pandemic, mainly due to the imposed lockdown, significant psychological problems had emerged in a significant part of the population, including older children and adolescents. School closure, leading to significant social isolation, was considered one of the most important reasons for pediatric mental health problems. However, how knowledge of COVID-19 related problems, modification of lifestyle and age, gender and severity of COVID-19 pandemic had influenced psychological problems of older children and adolescents has not been detailed. To evaluate these variables, a survey was carried out in Italy. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional survey was carried out by means of an anonymous online questionnaire administered to 2,996 students of secondary and high schools living in Italian Regions with different COVID-19 epidemiology. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,064 adolescent students (62.8% females; mean age, 15.4 Ã‚Â± 2.1 years), completed and returned the questionnaire. Most of enrolled students showed good knowledge of COVID-19-related problems. School closure was associated with significant modifications of lifestyle and the development of substantial psychological problems in all the study groups, including students living in Regions with lower COVID-19 incidence. However, in some cases, some differences, were evidenced. Sadness was significantly more frequent in females (84%) than males (68.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and in the 14-19-year-old age group than the 11-13-year-old age group (79.2% vs. 70.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Missing the school community was a significantly more common cause of sadness in girls (26.5% vs. 16.8%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), in southern Italy (26.45% vs. 20.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and in the 14-19-year-old group (24.2% vs. 14.7%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The multivariate regression analysis showed that male gender was a protective factor against negative feelings (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), leading to a decrease of 0.63 points in the total negative feelings index. Having a family member or an acquaintance with COVID-19 increased the negative feelings index by 0.1 points (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study shows that school closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak was associated with significant lifestyle changes in all the students, regardless of age and gender. Despite some differences in some subgroups, the study confirms that school closure can cause relevant mental health problems in older children and adolescents. This must be considered as a reason for the maintenance of all school activities, although in full compliance with the measures to contain the spread of the pandemic.","Esposito, Giannitto, Squarcia, Neglia, Argentiero, Minichetti, Cotugno, Principi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.628072","20210208","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; adolescent; mask; psychological problems; school","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10454,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on medical education and the challenges: how prepared is Nigeria?","Nigeria has one of the largest concentration of human resources for health in Africa. There are 46 accredited medical schools and the majority are owned by the various State Governments. The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic on the 11<sup>th</sup> of March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The Federal Government of Nigeria through the Federal Ministry of Education closed all tertiary institutions in Nigeria including the medical schools on the 19<sup>th</sup> of March 2020 so as to curtail the effects of the pandemic. The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on tertiary institutions in Nigeria include the disruption of the academic calendar of the schools. This is capable of affecting the mental health of medical students. The smooth financing of medical education in Nigeria could be at risk. The career progression of medical students and those in the Residency Training Program and the doctors seeking greener pastures abroad are all affected. Unfortunately the state of infrastructure in the medical schools could be said to be poor. However, a good medical education scheme is said to guarantee the medical security of the populace. The Government and its agencies should work out plans of ameliorating the effects of the pandemic on medical education. This could also be a period to re-position the sector so as to be able to face similar challenges in future. The time has come for the full application of technology in delivering medical education in Nigeria. Incidentally, the pandemic has encouraged the application of e-learning techniques for the continuing professional development of medical doctors in the country. This should be the new way to go.","Ossai","https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.37.45.24915","20210208","COVID-19; Nigeria; medical education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10455,""
"Psychological Resilience as a Protective Factor for Depression and Anxiety Among the Public During the Outbreak of COVID-19","Psychological resilience may reduce the impact of psychological distress to some extent. We aimed to investigate the mental health status of the public during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and explore the level and related factors of anxiety and depression. From February 8 to March 9, 2020, 3,180 public completed the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, the Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) for psychological resilience, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) for the attitudes and coping styles. The number of people with depressive symptoms (SDS &gt; 53) was 1,303 (the rate was 41.0%). The number of people with anxiety symptoms (SAS &gt; 50) was 1,184 (the rate was 37.2%). The depressed group and anxiety group had less education, more unmarried and younger age, as well as had significant different in SDS total score (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), SAS total score (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), CD-RISC total score (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and SCSQ score (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The binary logistic regression showed that female (<i>B</i> = -0.261, <i>P</i> = 0.026), strength (<i>B</i> = -0.079, <i>P</i> = 0.000), and the subscales of active coping style in SCSQ (<i>B</i> = -0.983, <i>P</i> = 0.000) remained protective factors and passive coping style (<i>B</i> = 0.293, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and higher SAS score (<i>B</i> = 0.175, <i>P</i> = 0.000) were risk factors for depression. Optimism (<i>B</i> = -0.041, <i>P</i> = 0.015) in CD-RISC was a protective factor, and passive coping styles (<i>B</i> = 0.483, <i>P</i> = 0.000) and higher SDS score (<i>B</i> = 0.134, <i>P</i> = 0.000) were risk factors for anxiety. This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires. The mental health of the public, especially females, the younger and less educational populations, and unmarried individuals, should be given more attention. Individuals with high level of mental resilience and active coping styles would have lower levels of anxiety and depression during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Song, Yang, Yang, Zhou, Ma, Teng, Chen, Ou, Li, Mathews, Nutley, Liu, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.618509","20210208","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; public; related factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10456,""

"Perceptions, Experiences, and Challenges of Physicians Involved in Dementia Care During the COVID-19 Lockdown in India: A Qualitative Study","<b>Introduction:</b> With 5.3 million people living with dementia in India and the pandemic wreaking havoc, dementia care has faced unique challenges during the outbreak, with reduced healthcare access, travel restriction, long-term lockdown and fear of hospitalization. We explored the experiences and barriers faced by the physicians involved in dementia care during the lockdown period. <b>Methods:</b> A qualitative approach was used with purposive sampling. After an initial pilot, 148 physicians were included in the study. They were virtually interviewed in-depth based on a pre-designed semi-structured questionnaire, in areas related to tele-consultations, attributes related to dementia care, challenges faced and way forward. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analyzed using Nvivo-10 software. Triangulation, peer debriefing and respondent validation were used to ensure rigor. <b>Results:</b> The overarching categories that emerged were &quot;Tele-medicine as the future of dementia care in India,&quot; &quot;people living with dementia being uniquely susceptible to the pandemic with a triple burden of: <i>age, ageism and lack of autonomy</i>&quot; and &quot;markedly reduced healthcare access in this population with significant mental health burden of caregivers.&quot; The experiences of the physicians were categorized into their challenges during the lockdown period and perceptions related to specific facets of dementia care during the crisis. The general physicians expressed special &quot;unmet needs&quot; of dementia-specific training and specialist collaboration. Most of the participants perceived ambiguity related to the newly released telepsychiatry guidelines. <b>Conclusion:</b> Resource constraints and pandemic burden are currently high. This study looks at the &quot;voices&quot; of those actively providing dementia care during the ongoing crisis and to the best of our knowledge, is the first one from India to do so. Concurring with their experiences, PwD and their families are exposed to multiple vulnerabilities during COVID-19, need tailored care, especially at the primary healthcare level which includes general physicians. These relevant &quot;voices&quot; are discussed in light of the new tele-psychiatry guidelines and further optimization of dementia care in an aging India.","Banerjee, Vajawat, Varshney, Rao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.615758","20210208","COVID-19; India; dementia care; experiences; healthcare workers; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10458,""
"Theoretical Mapping of Suicidal Risk Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mini-Review","Suicide prevention in times of COVID-19 pandemic has become more challenging than ever due to unusual circumstances. The common risk factors identified with regard to suicidal behavior are fear of COVID-19, economic instability, poor access to healthcare facilities, pre-existing psychiatric disorders, and social disconnect. The studies done so far have reported either case studies or have made an effort to understand the risk factors. An understanding of the underlying causal pattern from existing theories, behind these risks, will enable adopting appropriate prevention mechanisms. Hence, this review examines evidence related to risk factors of suicides that occurred during COVID 19 and discusses it in the light of three major theoretical approaches: interpersonal model, stress diathesis model, and cognitive model. The insights obtained from the three viewpoints reveal that perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, stress sensitivity, cognitive errors such as magnification, catastrophic thinking, arbitrary inference, and mind-reading are likely reasons behind these risk factors for suicide. It is suggested that awareness regarding COVID-19 stressors, use of community-based approaches like gatekeeper training, and brief online psychotherapy by using techniques of mindfulness, interpersonal psychotherapy, and cognitive behavior therapy can be useful in reducing suicide risk during COVID-19.","Raj, Ghosh, Singh, Verma, Arya","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589614","20210208","COVID-19; burdensomeness; cognitive distortions; diathesis; suicide; thwarted belongingness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10459,""

"Impact of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh: a spatiotemporal approach","It has been more than 10Ã‚Â months since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Wuhan, China, still menacing the world with a possible second wave. This study aimed to analyze how meteorological variables can affect the spread of local COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Nine spatial units were considered from a meteorological standpoint to characterize COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. The daily COVID-19 incidence and meteorological variable (e.g., mean temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed) data from April 5 to September 20, 2020, were collected. The Spearman rank correlation, heat maps, and multivariate quasi-Poisson regression were employed to understand their association. The effect of meteorological variables on COVID-19 transmission was modeled using a lag period of 10Ã‚Â days. Results showed that mean temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed are substantially associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. On the other hand, daily precipitation is significantly associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19 incidence. The relative risks (RR) of mean temperature for daily COVID-19 incidences were 1.222 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.214-1.232). For wind speed, the RR was 1.087 (95% CI, 1.083-1.090). For relative humidity, the RR was 1.027 (95% CI, 1.025-1.029). Overall, this study found the profound effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 incidence across selected nine areas in Bangladesh. This study is probably the first study to explore the impact of region-specific meteorological conditions on COVID-19 incidence in Bangladesh. Moreover, adjustments on the areal-aggregated and regional levels were made for three confounding factors, including lockdown, population density, and potential seasonal effects. The study's findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in high temperatures and humidity conditions, which contradicts many other countries' prior studies. The research outcomes will provide implications for future control and prevention measures in Bangladesh and other countries with similar climate conditions and population density.","Hridoy, Mohiman, Tusher, Nowraj, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-021-03535-x","20210208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10461,""
"Magnesium and Vitamin D Deficiency as a Potential Cause of Immune Dysfunction, Cytokine Storm and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation in covid-19 patients","Magnesium and vitamin D each have the possibility of affecting the immune system and consequently the cytokine storm and coagulation cascade in COVID-19 infections. Vitamin D is important for reducing the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and plays a role in pulmonary epithelial health. While the importance of vitamin D for a healthy immune system has been known for decades, the benefits of magnesium has only recently been elucidated. Indeed, magnesium is important for activating vitamin D and has a protective role against oxidative stress. Magnesium deficiency increases endothelial cell susceptibility to oxidative stress, promotes endothelial dysfunction, reduces fibrinolysis and increases coagulation. Furthermore, magnesium deficient animals and humans have depressed immune responses, which, when supplemented with magnesium, a partial or near full reversal of the immunodeficiency occurs. Moreover, intracellular free magnesium levels in natural killer cells and CD8 killer T cells regulates their cytotoxicity. Considering that magnesium and vitamin D are important for immune function and cellular resilience, a deficiency in either may contribute to cytokine storm in the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection.","DiNicolantonio, O'Keefe","https://www.google.com/search?q=Magnesium+and+Vitamin+D+Deficiency+as+a+Potential+Cause+of+Immune+Dysfunction,+Cytokine+Storm+and+Disseminated+Intravascular+Coagulation+in+covid-19+patients.","20210208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10462,""

The threat of the virus and consequences of the pandemic have a discernible impact on the mental health of citizens. This study aims to (a) evaluate the levels of anxiety, depression and well-being in a large Spanish sample during the confinement, (b) identify potential predictor variables associated to experiencing both clinical levels of distress and well-being in a sample of 2,122 Spanish people. By using descriptive analyses and logistic regression results revealed high rates of depression, anxiety and well-being. Specifically, our findings revealed that high levels of anxiety about COVID-19, increased substance use and loneliness as the strongest predictors of distress, while gross annual incomes and loneliness were strongest predictors of well-being. Finding of the present study provide a better insight about psychological adjustment to a pandemic and allows us to identify which population groups are at risk of experiencing higher levels of distress and which factors contribute to greater well-being, which could help in the treatments and prevention in similar stressful and traumatic situations.","Valiente, Contreras, Peinado, Trucharte, MartÃƒÂ­nez, VÃƒÂ¡zquez","https://doi.org/10.1017/SJP.2021.7","20210208","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€œ19; anxiety; depression; psychological adjustment; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10464,""

"COVID-19 and cytokine storm syndrome: can what we know about interleukin-6 in ovarian cancer be applied?","Improving early diagnosis along with timely and effective treatment of COVID-19 are urgently needed. However, at present, the mechanisms underlying disease spread and development, defined prognosis, and immune status of patients with COVID-19 remain to be determined. Patients with severe disease state exhibit a hyperinflammatory response associated with cytokine storm syndrome, hypercoagulability, and depressed cell-mediated immunity. These clinical manifestations, sharing similar pathogenesis, have been well-studied in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The present review suggests treatment approaches for COVID-19 based on strategies used against ovarian cancer, which shares similar immunopathology and associated coagulation disorders.The chronicization of the hyperinflammatory cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19 highlights a defective resistance phase that leads to aspecific chronic inflammation, associated with oxidative stress, which impairs specific T-cell response, induces tissue and endothelial damage, and thrombosis associated with systemic effects that lead to severe multi-organ failure and death. These events are similar to those observed in advanced ovarian cancer which share similar pathogenesis mediated primarily by Interleukin-6, which is, as well demonstrated in ovarian cancer, the key cytokine driving the immunopathology, related systemic symptoms, and patient prognosis.Consistent with findings in other disease models with similar immunopathology, such as advanced ovarian cancer, treatment of severe COVID-19 infection should target inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation disorders, and immunodepression to improve patient outcome. Correctly identifying disease stages, based on available laboratory data, and developing a specific protocol for each phase is essential for effective treatment.","MacciÃƒÂ², Oppi, Madeddu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-021-00772-6","20210208","COVID-19; Corticosteroids; Immunopathology; Interleukin-6; Ovarian cancer; Oxidative stress; Resistance; Tolerance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10467,""

Primary data were collected via an electronic survey and assessed via a retrospective pre/post design. Analyses compared practices before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Overall, data suggest that participants experienced significant pre/post decreases in self-care practices across multiple domains. As well, findings indicate that participants who identified as married, financially stable, and working non-remotely, and in good physical/mental health engaged in significantly more self-care practices than other participants, at post.

"The impact of viral epidemics and pandemics on acute mental health service use: An integrative review","The aim of this integrative review was to examine the impact of past viral epidemics on mental health, with a specific focus on changes in numbers of acute mental health presentations and mental health service recommendations in response to this, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following PRISMA methodology, databases were searched for relevant publications. A total of 83 articles with a range of methodologies were included to ensure broad coverage of this rapidly emerging research area. The literature supports an initial increase in mental health concerns which generally do not reach the threshold for diagnosis with a mental illness, but present to frontline telephone services. There is a potential delay before community and hospital-based mental health services see an increase in new or relapsing mental illness presentations. However vulnerable populations, such as people with pre-existing mental illness, are at increased risk of mental health issues during such public health crises. Many of the general recommendations distilled from the literature are closely aligned with existing strategic frameworks for mental health service provision. However, in review of these frameworks, gaps in the literature become more apparent, such as a failure to include people with lived experience, peer workers, and First Nations People in the COVID-19 mental health response.","Bowman, Branjerdporn, Turner, Kamara, Tyagi, Delos Reyes, Stapelberg","https://doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2021.1886864","20210208","COVID-19; SARS; mental health; service use; strategic frameworks; viral pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10469,""

"Trajectories of depression, anxiety and pandemic experiences; A longitudinal study of youth in New York during the Spring-Summer of 2020","Initial reports suggest that mental health problems were elevated early in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have followed-up participants as the pandemic evolved and examined both between and within person predictors of symptom trajectories. In the current study, adolescents and young adults (N=532) in New York were surveyed monthly between March 27<sup>th</sup> and July 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020, a period spanning the first peak and subsequent decline in COVID-19 infection rates in the region. Surveys assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Child Depression Inventory and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, as well as experiences related to the pandemic. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July. Some pandemic experiences followed a similar quadratic trajectory, while others decreased linearly across the study. Specific relationships emerged between some types of pandemic experiences and depression and anxiety symptoms. While symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth may have been elevated early in the pandemic, these findings suggest they subsided across Spring-Summer of 2020, with higher levels of both corresponding to a period of peak infection rates and decreases paralleling the decline in pandemic experiences and COVID-19 infection rates.","Hawes, Szenczy, Olino, Nelson, Klein","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778","20210207","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10471,""

"Idiographic network models of social media use and depression symptoms","Disentangling the impact of social media use on our well-being is a priority for psychological research. Numerous studies indicate that active social media use (ASMU) tends to enhance well-being, whereas passive social media use (PSMU) undermines it. However, such research has conducted analyses at the group-level, thus potentially obscuring individual differences. In this study, we examined person-centered relationships between social media use and depression symptoms by using a secondary analysis of a publicly available experience sampling dataset (Aalbers et al., 2019). Dutch undergraduate students (N = 125) reported PSMU, ASMU, and depression symptoms 7 times daily for 14 days. We (a) visualized interindividual variability in temporal associations between social media use and individual depression symptoms, (b) compared the aggregate network model to idiographic models, and (c) determined the distribution of person-specific temporal associations between PSMU, ASMU, and depression symptoms. Overall, we found that associations between social media use and depression symptoms differed substantially from individual to individual in both strength and kind. In addition, PSMU and ASMU were very weakly to weakly associated with depression symptoms for most individuals. Future work should examine the differential impact that social media have on our well-being, and how their effects may differ depending on our demographic characteristics, personality traits, and usage patterns.","Micaela Rodriguez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-A5B-FF0","20210209","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Psychometrics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-esteem","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10474,""
"How Relationship Satisfaction Influences Post-Pandemic COVID-19 Anxiety: A Four-Wave Study in China","The social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic exerts lasing impacts on peopleâ€™s mental health. However, whether and how peopleâ€™s pre-existing positive social relationships can serve as stable reserves to alleviate people psychological distress following the disaster remains unknown. To address the question, the current study examined whether pre-pandemic relationship satisfaction would predict post-pandemic COVID-19 anxiety through middle-pandemic perceived social support and/or gratitude using four-wave data in China (N = 222, 54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17). Results showed that peopleâ€™s COVID-19 anxiety decreased from the peak to the trough pandemic stage; perceived social support increased markedly from the pre-pandemic to the peak and remained stable afterwards, while relationship satisfaction remained unchanged throughout. Further, it was middle-pandemic perceived social support, but not gratitude, mediated the association between pre-pandemic relationship satisfaction and post-pandemic COVID-19 anxiety, indicating perceived social support played a more crucial role than gratitude in this process. Last, it is suggested to distinguish perceived social support from gratitude as two different components of social interactions.","Jingyi Ou et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604B-1D6-40D","20210209","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; relationship satisfaction; covid-19 anxiety; gratitude; perceived social support; longitudinal","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-09","",10475,""
