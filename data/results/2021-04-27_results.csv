"Depression and Anxiety Symptoms in Young Adults Before and During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Evidence from a Canadian Population-Based Cohort","Background: Concerns have been raised that the Covid-19 pandemic could increase risk for poor mental health, especially in young adults, a vulnerable age group. We investigated changes in depression and anxiety symptoms (overall and severe) from before to during the pandemic, as well as whether these changes are linked to Covid-19 related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities in young adults followed in the context of a population-based cohort. Method: Participants (n=1039) from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development reported on their depression and anxiety and completed a Covid-19 questionnaire during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Summer 2020 (age 22 years). Assessments at age 20 (2018) were used to estimate pre-pandemic depression and anxiety symptom severity. Results: While overall levels of depression and anxiety symptoms did not change, there was an increase in rates of severe depression (but not severe anxiety) from before (6.1%) to during (8.2%) the pandemic. Covid-19 related variables (e.g., loss of education/occupation, frequent news seeking) and pre-existing vulnerabilities (e.g., low SES, low social support) were not associated with changes in depression or anxiety symptoms. Further, youth with pre-existing depression and anxiety symptoms did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic, compared to those without; instead, they tended to show an improvement. Interpretation: Depression and anxiety symptoms in young adults from Quebec in Summer 2020 were comparable to symptoms reported in 2018. Most Covid-19 related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities were not associated with change in symptoms. However, the increased rate of severe depression is concerning.","K.

"Depression during the COVID-19 pandemic amongst residents of homeless shelters in France","Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected global mental health and well-being. However, the impact amongst homeless persons has not been fully evaluated. The ECHO study reports factors associated with depression amongst the homeless population living in shelters in France during the Spring of 2020. Methods: Interview data were collected from 527 participants living in temporary and/or emergency accommodation following France's first lockdown (02/05/20 - 07/06/20), in the metropolitan regions of Paris (74%), Lyon (19%) and Strasbourg (7%). Interviews were conducted in French, English, or with interpreters (33% of participants, ~20 languages). Presence of depression was ascertained using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: Amongst ECHO study participants, 30% had symptoms of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9[&ge;] 10). Multivariate analysis revealed depression to be associated with being female (aOR: 2.15; CI: 1.26-3.69), being single (aOR: 1.60; CI: 1.01-2.52), having a chronic illness (aOR: 2.32; CI: 1.43-3.78), facing food insecurity (aOR: 2.12; CI: 1.40-3.22) and participants' region of origin. Persons born in African and Eastern Mediterranean regions showed levels of depression comparable to those of French participants (30-33%) but higher than migrants from European countries (14%). Reduced rates of depression were observed amongst participants aged 30-49 (aOR: 0.60; CI: 0.38-0.95) and over 50 (aOR: 0.28; CI: 0.13-0.64), compared to 18-29-year-olds. Conclusions: Our results indicate high levels of depression among homeless persons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The value of these findings extends beyond the health crisis, as predicted future instability and economic repercussions could particularly impact the mental health of this vulnerable group.","Honor Scarlett; Camille Davisse-Paturet; Cecile Longchamps; Tarik El Aarbaoui; Cecile Allaire; Anne-Claire Colleville; Mary Convence-Arulthas; Lisa Crouzet; Simon Ducarroz; Maria Melchior","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.21255993","20210426","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13172,""
"Knowledge and Impact of COVID-19 on Middle-Aged and Older People living with HIV in Lima, Peru","COVID-19 has had an unprecedented worldwide impact, and Peru has had one of the highest COVID-19 case rates despite implementation of an early strict nationwide quarantine. Repercussions on Peru healthcare system may impact vulnerable populations, particularly people with HIV (PWH). We explored the knowledge of COVID-19 and the socioeconomic and health impact of the pandemic among middle-aged and older PWH. A cross-sectional telephone survey was administered to 156 PWH age >=40 years receiving care in one of two large HIV clinics in Lima, Peru. The majority of PWH (age 52+/-7.7 years, 41% female, 65% completed secondary school or less) were knowledgeable regarding COVID-19 symptoms and prevention methods. Nearly half of those employed prior to the pandemic reported job loss. Female sex (unadjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85 [95%CI 1.27-2.69]), low educational level (PR 1.62 [1.06-2.48]) and informal work (PR 1.58 [1.06-2.36]) were risk factors for unemployment but not in adjusted models. Increased anxiety was reported in 64% and stress in 77%. COVID-19 has had a substantial socioeconomic and mental health impact on PWH living in Lima, Peru, particularly those with lower educational levels and informal workers. Efforts are needed to ensure continued medical care and socioeconomic support of PWH in Peru.","Monica Maria Diaz; Diego M Cabrera; Marcela Gil-Zacarias; Valeria Ramirez; Manuel Saavedra; Cesar Carcamo; Evelyn Hsieh; Patricia J Garcia","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.21255998","20210426","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13173,""
"Preparedness and impact of COVID 19 infection at tertiary care neurology centers in Pakistan","We aimed to assess the response and impact of covid 19 pandemic at tertiary care centers in Pakistan especially pertaining to neurological care, facilities and training. A pre-tested survey form was sent to 40 neurology tertiary care centers in all the provinces in the country in the first week of July 2020. 33 filled forms were received, out of which 18 were public (government) and 15 were private hospitals. Estimated 1300 HCW (faculty, medical officers, trainees and nurses) work at these 33 participating centers. There were 17 deaths among HCW (1.3%) at ten centers. Sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) were provided to 158 HCW (12%). 129 (10%)HCW tested positive for COVID 19 at 31 centers including trainees/medical officers (39), consultants (29) and nursing and other staff (61). Due to low neurology admissions, 23/33 hospitals (70%) posted neurology trainees in COVID 19Ã‚Â units to contribute to covid care. Less than 50% hospitals did covid screening PCR before admission to neurology wards. Only 10% hospitals provide training and regular update to HCW. Neurology tele-health services were started for clinically stable patients at 15 (45%) centers. Only 60% neurology training programs were able to start online training. Ongoing research studies and trials focusing neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were done at 10 (30%) centers. Modification of facilities for COVID patients showed that 24(72%) hospitals strictly reduced the number of attendants accompanying patients. Only 10 (30%) centers had neurophysiological tests being conducted on COVID-19 patients. Mental health support services to HCW were provided at 12 (36%) centers. Among HCW 10% tested positive for covid and 1.3% died. Mental health support services offered for HCW were available in 36% institutions. Neurology training was substantially affected due to low admissions, limited ward rounds and limited availability of online training.","Kanwar, Awan, Sajjad, Farooq, Chand, Larak, Malik, Wazir, Aslam, Hashim, Niazi, Rasheed, Khan, Hamdani, Saleem, Iqbal, Asif, Shahbaz, Majid, Wasay","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.117462","20210426","COVID -19; Health care workers; Neurology training; Pakistan; Personal protective equipment; Tertiary care centers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13174,""
"COVID-19 as a traumatic stressor is an indicator of mental health symptomatology","The mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are gaining attention. While many are experiencing increased stress due to COVID-19, some perceive the pandemic as traumatic. This preliminary study identified respondents who endorsed a COVID-19-related trauma as their most stressful traumatic experience (i.e., index trauma). We analyzed data from an online Canadian survey (May-July 2020;Ã‚Â NÃ‚Â =1,018). Nearly 3% of participants endorsed a COVID-19-related index trauma.

"","During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities confined adults, adolescents and children to their homes. Recent articles warn of possible long-term consequences on mental health, especially for those who suffer from underlying psychiatric conditions and for vulnerable sections of the population. The present study explores the psychological impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on outpatients at the Centre of Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS), which is based in Barcelona. A total of 441 caregivers answered an online ad-hoc surveyÃ¢â‚¬â€°on their sociodemographic and economic situation, perceived stress, and clinical changes and coping strategies observed in their children during lockdown. The Chi-square test was used to compare the response percentages for each behaviour or symptom between age, gender and diagnostic groups. Variance and post-hoc test were also analyzed, as was the Pearson correlation. The use of electronic devices has significantly increased. There has also been an increase in symptoms such as attentional problems, fatigue and irritability, among others. Differences were found between age and gender groups. The diagnostic groups most affected by confinement were Autism Spectrum Disorders and Conduct Disorders. The survey also discovered a relationship between the loss of family income, parental stress and increased symptoms in children. Confinement has increased externalizing symptoms and behaviours as well as Covid-19 related concerns, somatic problems and anxieties. It is important to observe the fluctuation of symptoms and how young people adapt to the pandemic in order to reach a better understanding of the situation and devise new strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic.","Lopez-Serrano, DÃƒÂ­az-BÃƒÂ³veda, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-VallespÃƒÂ­, Santamarina-PÃƒÂ©rez, Bretones-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Calvo, LeraMiguel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.04.002","20210426","COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Infecciones por coronavirus / psicologÃƒÂ­a; adolescentes; adolescents; child; confinamiento; epidemias; epidemics; niÃƒÂ±os","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13176,""
"[The COVID-19 implications: the role of stress and stigmatization]","At all levels of society, almost polarizing attitudes towards coronavirus are manifested, ranging from panic and empty store shelves to complete denying the existence of coronavirus problem. The wave of coronavirus parties and as well as demonstrations against restrictive measures related to infection swept the world. In addition, protests against arrivals from COVID risk areas are known. Stigma and fear can severely impede efforts to manage the spread of COVID outbreak. The predisposing factors in development of COVID stigma are lack of knowledge, rapid virus spreading, relatively higher mortality and absence of effective treatment. Meanwhile, at the level of society, particular processes are taking place, when not only infected ones, but also healthy members of society become subject to stigmatization, that can be determined as &quot;probably&quot; infected.

"Impact of COVID-19 social-distancing on sleep timing and duration during a university semester","Social-distancing directives to contain community transmission of the COVID-19 virus can be expected to affect sleep timing, duration or quality. Remote work or school may increase time available for sleep, with benefits for immune function and mental health, particularly in those individuals who obtain less sleep than age-adjusted recommendations. Young adults are thought to regularly carry significant sleep debt related in part to misalignment between endogenous circadian clock time and social time. We examined the impact of social-distancing measures on sleep in young adults by comparing sleep self-studies submitted by students enrolled in a university course during the 2020 summer session (entirely remote instruction, N = 80) with self-studies submitted by students enrolled in the same course during previous summer semesters (on-campus instruction, N = 452; cross-sectional study design). Self-studies included 2-8 week sleep diaries, two chronotype questionnaires, written reports, and sleep tracker (Fitbit) data from a subsample. Students in the 2020 remote instruction semester slept later, less efficiently, less at night and more in the day, but did not sleep more overall despite online, asynchronous classes and ~44% fewer work days compared to students in previous summers. Subjectively, the net impact on sleep was judged as positive or negative in equal numbers of students, with students identifying as evening types significantly more likely to report a positive impact, and morning types a negative impact. Several features of the data suggest that the average amount of sleep reported by students in this summer course, historically and during the 2020 remote school semester, represents a homeostatic balance, rather than a chronic deficit. Regardless of the interpretation, the results provide additional evidence that social-distancing measures affect sleep in heterogeneous ways.","Smit, Juda, Livingstone, U, Mistlberger","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250793","20210426","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13178,""
"Levels and predictors of fear and health anxiety during the current outbreak of COVID-19 in immunocompromised and chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional correlational study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has become a clinical threat to healthy people as well as immunocompromised patients and those with pre-existing chronic diseases around the world. This study, which used a cross-sectional correlational design, aimed to assess the levels of fear and health anxiety and to investigate their predictors during the current outbreak of COVID-19 in immunocompromised and chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia. Sociodemographic and clinical data, fear of COVID-19, and health anxiety measurements were collected by online surveys from June 15 to July 15, 2020. Univariate and multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors. A total of 1,030 patients in 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia completed the questionnaire. A significant number of patients with chronic diseases experienced considerable levels of fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was found that 21.44% of participants met the criteria for anxiety cases, and 19.4% were considered borderline anxiety cases. In regression analysis, significant predictors of fear and health anxiety were female gender, lower education, middle-aged, divorced or widowed, receiving immunosuppressants, type of chronic disease (Crohn's disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases), and media use as a source of knowledge about COVID-19. Immunocompromised and chronic disease patients are vulnerable to fear and anxiety during epidemic infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Optimizing this population's compliance with appropriate infection prevention and control strategies is crucial during the infectious outbreaks to ensure their safety, to decrease the risk of infection and serious complications, and reduce their fear and health anxiety. Effective positive psychological interventions and support strategies also need to be immediately implemented to increase psychological resilience and improve the mental health of these patients. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia need special attention from health authorities, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to manage maladaptive forms of health anxiety and fear.","Al-Rahimi, Nass, Hassoubah, Wazqar, Alamoudi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250554","20210426","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13179,""
"The Impact of 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic on Physical and Mental Health: A Comparison between China and Spain","The differences between physical and mental health across continents during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were unknown. This study compared the levels of impact of COVID-19 and mental health between people from Spain and China and correlated mental health parameters with variables relating to symptoms similar to COVID-19, COVID-19 knowledge, and precautionary measures. We collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary measures. Participants filled the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). To analyze the differences in the mental health parameters, the mean scores between the Chinese and Spanish respondents were compared by the independent sample t-test. The differences in categorical variables between the two samples were analyzed by the chi-squared test. Linear regression was used to calculate the univariate associations between independent variables and mental health parameters for the Chinese and Spanish respondents separately with adjustment for age, gender and education. A total of 1528 participants (687 from Spain; 841 from China) were recruited. The mean age of Chinese respondents was 24.73 years (SD=7.602; Range: 18-65 years), and the mean age of Spanish respondents was 43.06 years (SD=11.951; Range: 18-76 years). Spanish participants reported significantly more symptoms similar to COVID-19 infection (e.g., fever, sore throat and breathing difficulty), contact history with COVID-19, higher perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, frequent use of medical services and less confidence in medical services as compared with Chinese (p&lt;0.001). Spanish participants reported significantly higher stress and depression scores, while the Chinese participants reported significantly higher IES-R scores (p&lt;0.001). Chinese participants encountered more discrimination from other countries (p&lt;0.001). Significantly more Chinese participants reported the use of face masks than Spanish (p&lt;0.001). More health information was associated with adverse mental health in Spanish (p&lt;0.05).

"The Efficacy of computerized Cognitive Behavior Therapy (cCBT) for Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Patients with COVID-19: Randomized Controlled Trial","The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher than usual. Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was urgently needed. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response. To evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19. We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression and/or anxiety for patients who scored at or above 7 scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) and/or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at 5 sites were randomized into 2 groups: cCBT+ treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 126) and cCBT without TAU (n =126); the cCBT+TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD17 and HAMA scores. The secondary outcome measures were the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Assessments were carried out at pre- and post-intervention. The patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression in one of the centers were assessed again within 1 month after the post-intervention assessment. The cCBT+TAU group displayed a significant decreased score on the HAMD17, HAMA, SDS, SAS, and AIS after the intervention, compared to that in the TAU group (all P &lt; .001). A mixed-effects repeated-measures model revealed significant improvement in symptoms of depression (HAMD17 and SDS scores), anxiety (HAMA and SAS scores), and insomnia (AIS score) during the post-intervention and follow-up periods in the cCBT+TAU group (all P &lt; .05, Bonferroni correction). Additionally, the improvement of insomia among the female and middle-school-educated populations in the CCBT+TAU group showed no significant differences when compared to the TAU group (both P &gt; .05). The findings of this study suggest that the cCBT program we developed was an effective nonpharmacological treatment for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among patients with COVID-19. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects of cCBT for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in patients with COVID-19.

"Associations Between Rural-Urban Status, Health Outcomes and Behaviors, and COVID-19 Perceptions Among Meditation App Users: A Longitudinal Survey","Rural-urban differences in health outcomes and behaviors have been well-documented, with significant rural health disparities frequently highlighted. Mobile health (mHealth) apps, such as meditation apps, are a novel method for improving health and behaviors. These apps may be a critical health promotion strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially be used to address rural health disparities. However, limited research has assessed whether meditation app health outcomes are associated with rural/urban residence, and it is unclear whether disparities in health and behaviors between rural and urban populations would persist among meditation app users. We aimed to explore associations between rural-urban status, psychological outcomes, and physical activity among users of a mobile meditation app. We further aimed to explore associations between rural-urban status and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity, and to explore changes in these outcomes in rural vs. urban app users over time. This study was a secondary analysis of a national survey conducted in subscribers to the meditation app, Calm. Eligible participants completed online baseline (April-June) and follow-up (June-September) surveys assessing demographics, psychological outcomes, physical activity, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Participants (N=8392) were female (83.9%), non-Hispanic (93.6%), White (91.8%), had high socioeconomic status (52.3% Ã¢â€°Â¥$100,000 income; 86.4% Ã¢â€°Â¥bachelor's degree) and resided in a metropolitan area core (85.7%; Rural-Urban Commuting Area 1). Rural-urban status was not associated with baseline stress, depression, anxiety, pre-COVID-19 and current physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Repeated-measures models showed overall decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on physical activity from baseline to follow-up, and no significant changes in stress or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress and mental health over time. Models also showed no significant main effects of rural-urban status, COVID-19 statewide prevalence at baseline, or change in COVID-19 statewide prevalence. We did not find associations between rural-urban status and psychological outcomes (i.e., stress, depression, anxiety), physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Rural-urban status does not appear to drive differences in outcomes among meditation app users, and the use of mHealth apps should continue to be explored as a health promotion strategy in both rural and urban populations. Furthermore, our results did not show negative cumulative effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes and physical activity among app users in our sample (majority urban, White, female and of high socioeconomic status) Further research is needed to investigate meditation apps as a health promotion strategy in rural and urban populations.","Bhuiyan, Puzia, Stecher, Huberty","https://doi.org/10.2196/26037","20210426","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13182,""

Possible differences in demographic variables between groups were compared using Mann Whitney U test and Chi-squared test. Significant demographic differences between groups were controlled for using logistical regression analysis or an independent one-way analysis of covariance. Thousand hundred and two pregnant women completed the questionnaires during COVID-19, and 364 pregnant women before COVID-19. We found no differences in clinically high levels of anxiety (HADS-AÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°8) and depression (HADS-DÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°8) in women during COVID-19 (19.5% and 13.2%, respectively) and women before COVID-19 (23.1% and 15.7%, respectively). A question was implemented whether participants related their stress level to COVID-19. Women who related their stress to the COVID-19 pandemic reported significantly higher overall stress levels on the PSS-10 compared to women with stress unrelated to COVID-19 (mean, 15.62; standard deviation [SD], 6.44 vs. mean, 10.28; SD, 5.48; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In contrast to previous studies, COVID-19 did not increase anxiety and depression levels in Dutch pregnant women. Women who related their perceived stress to the COVID-19 pandemic experienced higher stress levels than women who did not relate their stress to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that interventions that specifically aim to reduce COVID-19 stress, may help to reduce overall stress levels in pregnant women during the pandemic.","Zilver, Broekman, Hendrix, de Leeuw, Mentzel, van Pampus, de Groot","https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482X.2021.1907338","20210426","COVID-19; Pregnancy; SARS-COV-2; anxiety; depression; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13184,""
"Functional Connectome Prediction of Anxiety Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic","Increased anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely noted. The purpose of this study was to test whether the prepandemic functional connectome predicted individual anxiety induced by the pandemic. Anxiety scores from healthy undergraduate students were collected during the severe and remission periods of the pandemic (first survey, February 22-28, 2020, N=589; second survey, April 24 to May 1, 2020, N=486). Brain imaging data and baseline (daily) anxiety ratings were acquired before the pandemic. The predictive performance of the functional connectome on individual anxiety was examined using machine learning and was validated in two external undergraduate student samples (N=149 and N=474). The clinical relevance of the findings was further explored by applying the connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety to distinguish between individuals with specific mental disorders and matched healthy control subjects (generalized anxiety disorder, N=43; major depression, N=536; schizophrenia, N=72). Anxiety scores increased from the prepandemic baseline to the severe stage of the pandemic and remained high in the remission stage. The prepandemic functional connectome predicted pandemic-related anxiety and generalized to the external sample but showed poor performance for predicting daily anxiety. The connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety further distinguished between participants with generalized anxiety and healthy control subjects but were not useful for diagnostic classification in major depression and schizophrenia. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the functional connectome to predict individual anxiety induced by major stressful events (e.g., the current global health crisis), which advances our understanding of the neurobiological basis of anxiety susceptibility and may have implications for developing targeted psychological and clinical interventions that promote the reduction of stress and anxiety.","He, Wei, Yang, Zhang, Cheng, Feng, Yang, Zhuang, Chen, Ren, Li, Wang, Mao, Chen, Liao, Cui, Li, He, Lei, Feng, Chen, Xie, Rolls, Su, Li, Qiu","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20070979","20210426","Anxiety; Coronavirus/COVID-19; Functional Connectome; Neuroimaging; Resting-State fMRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13185,""

"Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in a representative Australian adult cohort","To estimate initial levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety, and their changes during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia; to identify trajectories of symptoms of depression and anxiety; to identify factors associated with these trajectories. Longitudinal cohort study; seven fortnightly online surveys of a representative sample of 1296 Australian adults from the beginning of COVID-19-related restrictions in late March 2020 to mid-June 2020. Symptoms of depression and anxiety, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales; trajectories of symptom change. Younger age, being female, greater COVID-19-related work and social impairment, COVID-19-related financial distress, having a neurological or mental illness diagnosis, and recent adversity were each significantly associated with higher baseline depression and anxiety scores. Growth mixture models identified three latent trajectories for depression symptoms (low throughout the study, 81% of participants; moderate throughout the study, 10%; initially severe then declining, 9%) and four for anxiety symptoms (low throughout the study, 77%; initially moderate then increasing, 10%; initially moderate then declining, 5%; initially mild then increasing before again declining, 8%). Factors statistically associated with not having a low symptom trajectory included mental disorder diagnoses, COVID-19-related financial distress and social and work impairment, and bushfire exposure. Our longitudinal data enabled identification of distinct symptom trajectories during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Early intervention to ensure that vulnerable people are clinically and socially supported during a pandemic should be a priority.","Batterham, Calear, McCallum, Morse, Banfield, Farrer, Gulliver, Cherbuin, Rodney Harris, Shou, Dawel","https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51043","20210426","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Depressive disorders; Infectious diseases; Longitudinal studies; Respiratory tract infections","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13187,""
"Psychological burden of covid-19 health crisis on health professionals and interventions to minimize the effect: what has history already taught us?","Health professionals have been at the frontline of the health service since the outbreak of covid-19, responding promptly to diagnose, support and treat infected patients. World Health Organization (WHO) has already praised their contribution and their essential role in controlling this disease. Some of the main concerns of covid-19's impact to health service staff include work overload, exhaustion, and high risk of self-infection or transmission to family members. Moreover, during the pandemic, caregivers' mental health inevitably becomes vulnerable, with salient stress and anxiety-related symptoms. Uncertainty, fear of contagion, guilt, hopelessness, stigmatization and, in some cases, long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are few of the potential effects posed by this outbreak on health workers. In this review, lessons learnt from previous global crises or pandemics on the psychological impact of health workers are presented. History could potentially provide essential information on how to best manage, support and optimize our approach to this highly appreciated and much needed group of professionals. Targeted and prompt interventions could reduce the psychological strain of health professionals, thus, further improving provided patient care. Covid-19 is an on-going health crisis and this work, even though generated by limited existing data, could be used to inform governments and/or institutions and lead on decisions and changes in current guidelines.","Tsonis, Diakaki, Gkrozou, Papadaki, Dimitriou, Paraskevaidis, Kyrgiou, Paraskevaidis, Paschopoulos, Tsapakis, Siafaka","https://doi.org/10.1708/3594.35763","20210426","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13188,""
"Embracing resilience in multiple sclerosis: a new perspective from COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in several psychological consequences. Past epidemiological experiences already showed the deep albeit heterogeneous psychological repercussions of pandemics. Nevertheless, little is known about COVID-19 outbreak and the possible strategies for boosting resilience in patients with chronic diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Therefore, we designed a study aiming to assess the changes in mental distress during COVID-19 outbreak in patients with MS and to identifyfactors contributing to resilience's development.We enrolled 106 patients (69 relapsing-remitting, 20 secondary-progressive, and 17 primary-progressive) whose neuropsychological assessment before the COVID-19 pandemic (1 January 2019-1 March 2020) was available. It consisted of Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and patient-reported MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ-P). All patients were re-tested during Italian lockdown through an online survey, comprehensive of sociodemographic information, HADS self-rating Scale, MSNQ-P Questionnaire and finally Connor-Davidson Resilience self-rating Scale (CD-RISC 25), in order to evaluate resilience.No significant changes in HADS and MSNQ-P scores were detected during COVID-19 pandemic in our population. Though, pre-existing lower HADS and MSNQ-P scores but not demographic, disease- and treatment-related elements were found significantly (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001) and independently associated with a better resilience attitude.","Sbragia, Colombo, Pollio, Cellerino, Lapucci, Inglese, Mancardi, Boffa","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1916964","20210426","COVID-19; anxiety; multiple sclerosis; pandemic; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13189,""
"Financial toxicity, mental health, and gynecologic cancer treatment: The effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among low-income women in New York City","New York City (NYC) emerged as an epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and marginalized populations were affected at disproportionate rates. The authors sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on cancer treatment, anxiety, and financial distress among low-income patients with gynecologic cancer during the peak of the NYC pandemic. Medicaid-insured women who were receiving gynecologic oncology care at 2 affiliated centers were contacted by telephone interviews between March 15 and April 15, 2020. Demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained through self-report and retrospective chart review. Financial toxicity, anxiety, and cancer worry were assessed using modified, validated surveys. In total, 100 patients completed the telephone interview. The median age was 60 years (range, 19-86 years), and 71% had an annual income &lt;$40,000. A change in employment status and early stage cancer (stage I and II) were associated with an increase in financial distress (P &lt; .001 and P = .008, respectively). Early stage cancer and telehealth participation were significantly associated with increased worry about future finances (P = .017 and P = .04, respectively). Lower annual income (&lt;$40,000) was associated with increased cancer worry and anxiety compared with higher annual income (&gt;$40,000; P = .036 and P = .017, respectively). When controlling for telehealth participation, income, primary language, and residence in a high COVID-19 prevalence area, a delay in medical care resulted in a 4-fold increased rate of anxiety (P = .023, 95% CI, 1.278-14.50). Race was not significantly associated with increased financial distress, cancer worry, or anxiety. Low socioeconomic status was the most common risk factor for increased financial distress, cancer worry, and anxiety. Interventions aimed at improving access to timely oncology care should be implemented during this ongoing pandemic.","Chen, Zhou, Glynn, Frey, Balogun, Kanis, Holcomb, Gorelick, Thomas, Christos, Chapman-Davis","https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33537","20210426","Medicaid; anxiety; cancer worry; financial toxicity; gynecologic oncology; health care disparity; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13190,""
"Effects of a multi-faceted education and support programme on anxiety symptoms among people with systemic sclerosis and anxiety during COVID-19 (SPIN-CHAT): a two-arm parallel, partially nested, randomised, controlled trial","No trials have tested multifaceted mental health interventions recommended by public health organisations during COVID-19. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program on anxiety symptoms and other mental health outcomes among people vulnerable during COVID-19 owing to a pre-existing medical condition. The SPIN-CHAT Trial was a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, partially nested, randomised, controlled trial (1:1 allocation to intervention or waitlist). Eligible participants with systemic sclerosis were recruited from the international SPIN COVID-19 Cohort. SPIN COVID-19 Cohort participants were eligible for the trial if they completed baseline measures and had at least mild anxiety symptoms, had not tested positive for COVID-19, and were not currently receiving mental health counselling. SPIN-CHAT is a 4-week (3 sessions per week) videoconference-based group intervention that provided education and practice with mental health coping strategies, and provided social support to reduce isolation. Groups included 6-10 participants. The primary outcome analysed in the intention-to-treat population was anxiety symptoms (PROMIS Anxiety 4a version 1.0) immediately post-intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04335279 and is complete. Of participants who completed baseline measures between April 9, 2020, and April 27, 2020, 560 participants were eligible and 172 participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or waitlist (n=86). Mean age was 55Ã‚Â·0 years (SD 11Ã‚Â·4 years), 162 (94%) were women, and 136 (79%) identified as White. In intention-to-treat analyses, the intervention did not significantly reduce anxiety symptoms post-intervention (-1Ã‚Â·57 points, 95% CI -3Ã‚Â·59 to 0Ã‚Â·45; standardised mean difference [SMD] -0Ã‚Â·22 points) but reduced symptoms 6 weeks later (-2Ã‚Â·36 points, 95% CI -4Ã‚Â·56 to -0Ã‚Â·16; SMD -0Ã‚Â·31). Depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks post-intervention (-1Ã‚Â·64 points, 95% CI -2Ã‚Â·91 to -0Ã‚Â·37; SMD -0Ã‚Â·31); no other secondary outcomes were significant. No adverse events were reported. The intervention did not significantly improve anxiety symptoms or other mental health outcomes post-intervention. However, anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks later, potentially capturing the time it took for new skills and social support between intervention participants to affect mental health. Multi-faceted interventions such as SPIN-CHAT have potential to address mental health needs in vulnerable groups during COVID-19, yet uncertainty remains about effectiveness.

"Psychological Health amidst COVID-19: A Review of existing literature in the Indian Context","The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a global health crisis. As of now, the total confirmed cases have exceeded 50 million and total deaths more than 1 million across the world. Such widespread diseases in the past have been associated with a surge in mental health disturbances. In this backdrop, the present review article pertains to discuss the overall impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health by synthesizing the existing literature from India, using PRISMA technique. The articles have been retrieved from Google scholar, NCBI and PubMed database. The result obtained on synthesizing the literature indicates that lockdown (home confinement) and social distancing as a measure to mitigate the outbreak of disease have affected physical and mental well-being. There has been an increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders due to sustained stress related to COVID-19. It has led to a medico-socio-economic crisis around the world. The pandemic continues to evolve with several countries experiencing multiple waves due to continuous mutations in the virus. Hence, it is essential to carefully observe and monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the onset and progression of poor mental health.","Shukla, Manohar Singh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100736","20210426","Anxiety; Depression; India; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13192,""

"Coping During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Older Adults Across the United States","<b>Objective:</b> Older adults may struggle with stresses and daily life challenges associated with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Yet they may also utilize emotional and behavioral coping strategies. This qualitative paper aims to identify ways of coping with worries and stress during the pandemic from the perspectives of older adults in the United States. <b>Methods:</b> The COVID-19 Coping Study recruited 6,938 adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 through online multi-frame sampling from April 2-May 31, 2020 across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The online questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on daily life, mental health, and well-being. This included an open-ended question regarding participants' coping strategies. We used qualitative content analysis to identify and code diverse coping strategies. Our general inductive approach enabled findings to emerge from the most frequent and dominant themes in the raw data. <b>Results:</b> A total of 5,180 adults [74% of the total sample; mean age 67.3 (SD 7.9); 63.8% female] responded to the question about using strategies to cope with living through the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequently-reported strategies included exercising and going outdoors, modifying routines, following public health guidelines, adjusting attitudes, and staying socially connected. Some coping strategies were health-limiting (e.g., overeating), while most strategies encouraged self-improvement, positive adjustment, and wellness. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides novel qualitative evidence on coping strategies of older adults early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings can inform community and clinical interventions to support older adults that harness positive coping strategies such as exercise, modified routines, and social strategies to improve physical and mental health, foster social support, and encourage meaningful daily activities during times of stress and trauma.","Finlay, Kler, O'Shea, Eastman, Vinson, Kobayashi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.643807","20210426","aging; coping strategies; mental health; qualitative methods; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13194,""
"Evaluation of a Short-Term Digital Group Intervention to Relieve Mental Distress and Promote Well-Being Among Community-Dwelling Older Individuals During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Study Protocol","Older individuals are at an increased risk of experiencing adverse social and health consequences due to both the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, such as social distancing. To promote community-dwelling older individuals' well-being during this time, the aims of the current project are to develop effective strategies in order (a) to increase older individuals' digital literacy, and (b) to help them acquire behavioral and cognitive skills that will improve their coping abilities with the stressful situation created as a result of the pandemic, as well as reducing adverse mental health effects. The project comprises an intervention arm that includes digital group sessions for older individuals meant to improve their digital literacy, promote their effective coping, and relieve their mental distress and loneliness. Subjects receive a short-term (seven sessions), twice-weekly, digitally guided group intervention through Zoom (a video conferencing app), and WhatsApp (instant messaging app). The wait list control-group participants receive twice-weekly telephone calls from a research assistant during a parallel period. Web-based questionnaires are filled in pre- and post-participation. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed by comparing pre- and post-measures, between intervention and control groups. This protocol offers a model for helping to support vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is applicable regardless of the outbreak of a global health crisis or the imposition of lockdown rules; in fact, it has the potential to contribute to the social inclusion of vulnerable populations during routine times as well as during emergencies.

"Assessing the mental health condition of home-confined university level students of Bangladesh due to the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic drove the Government of Bangladesh to shut down educational institutions, which had an enormous effect on the psychological health of students. This study aimed to assess the mental health status of Bangladeshi university students during the lockdown period. Through an online-based questionnaire, information was collected from 509 university students of Bangladesh from June 19, 2020, to June 28, 2020, using convenient sampling. K-means clustering was applied to organize students according to their psychological health score, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to determine the association among the student's activities and their mental health during the pandemic. In addition, these associations were examined through chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression. Students were categorized into four categories where 4.32% had mild, 72.7% had moderate, 12.57% had moderately severe, and 10.41% suffered from severe mental health imbalance. The results showed that having family members affected by the coronavirus, facing insecurity, using social media, and smoking habits increased the mental health imbalances of students; in contrast, being worried about studying, future career, spending more time with family members, and participation in household chores reduced the mental health disturbances of students. On the other hand, the results of the ordinal logistic regression indicated that sleeping time and participation in household chores were preventive factors for students. This study reveals that a large proportion of University students of Bangladesh suffered from mental health disturbances during the lockdown period. Implementing mental health plans and providing job security, improved communication approaches toward family members, not flattening illusive news, and preoccupation in household activities may assist to enhance the mental health status of the university students. The authors believe that this study's findings will be helpful to expedite the rate of attaining the sustainable development goal associated with health status in Bangladesh.","Alam, Ali, Banik, Yasmin, Salma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01542-w","20210426","COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health assessment; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13196,""

"Quality of Life and Its Predictive Factors Among Healthcare Workers After the End of a Movement Lockdown: The Salient Roles of COVID-19 Stressors, Psychological Experience, and Social Support","Although healthcare workers play a crucial role in helping curb the hazardous health impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their lives and major functioning have been greatly affected by the pandemic. This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (QoL) of Malaysian healthcare workers and its predictive factors. An online sample of 389 university-based healthcare workers completed questionnaires on demographics, clinical features, COVID-19-related stressors, psychological experiences, and perceived social support after the movement lockdown was lifted. All domains of QoL were within the norms of the general population except for social relationship QoL, which was lower than the norm. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that COVID-19-related stressors (e.g., stress due to annual leave being frozen, loss of daily routine, and frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients) and psychological sequelae (e.g., greater severity of depression, anxiety, and stress) predicted lower QoL. Conversely, greater perceived social support from friends and significant others predicted higher QoL. Clinical and demographic characteristics predicted QoL to a lesser extent: A history of pre-existing medical illness was associated only with lower physical health QoL, whereas older age and being single, divorced, or widowed were only predictive of higher environmental QoL. Efforts to enhance QoL among healthcare workers in response to the pandemic should focus on mitigating COVID-19-related stressors and psychological sequelae and facilitating social support.","Woon, Mansor, Mohamad, Teoh, Leong Bin Abdullah","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.652326","20210426","COVID-19-related stressors; Malaysia; healthcare workers; perceived social support; psychological sequelae; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13198,""

It also suggests ways in which to improve the mental health levels of students with financial difficulties by improving their mental resilience.","Feng, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.649195","20210426","COVID-19; all-round development of college students; college students with financial difficulties; mental health level; psychological resilience score","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13199,""
"Suffering and Salutogenesis: A Conceptual Analysis of Lessons for Psychiatry From Existential Positive Psychology (PP20) in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on the thoughts, emotions and behavior of millions of people all around the world. In this context, a large body of scientific literature examining the mental health impact of this global crisis has emerged. The majority of these studies have framed this impact in terms of pre-defined categories derived from psychiatric nosology, such as anxiety disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. These constructs often fail to capture the complexity of the actual experiences of the individuals being studied; more specifically, they describe these experiences exclusively in terms of disease, while neglecting their potentially adaptive or &quot;salutogenic&quot; aspects. Similarly, discussion of psychological assistance for these individuals has largely been confined to a reiteration of &quot;evidence-based&quot; psychological or pharmacological techniques which can be delivered using remote access technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches are likely to be of mixed efficacy. Conversely, &quot;negative emotions&quot; or distressing psychological experiences may actually be functional in the setting of a disaster or crisis, serving to minimize harm, maximize social coherence and compliance, and facilitate adherence to safety measures. The limitations of the &quot;conventional&quot; approach are, to a certain degree, inherent to the prevailing medical model of mental health. Beyond these considerations lies the concept of &quot;salutogenesis,&quot; a term which refers to the innate capacity of individuals to create and maintain health and well-being in the face of adversity. Using principles derived from the second wave of positive psychology (PP2.0), particularly its emphasis on the totality of human experience and the possibility of deriving meaning and character growth from suffering, this paper conceptually analyses the relevant aspects of salutogenesis and PP2.0, and proposes an alternate approach for addressing mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an approach, while acknowledging the utility of the conventional medical-psychotherapeutic model in specific cases, reduces the risk of medicalizing human experience, and provides individuals and communities with opportunities for growth and adaptation. The benefits of this proposal could potentially extend far beyond the current crisis, offering an opportunity for the field of psychiatry and mental health research to move away from a purely &quot;disease-centered&quot; model.","Rajkumar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.646334","20210426","COVID-19; mental health; positive psychology; psychiatry; salutogenesis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13200,""
"The Psychological and Academic Effects of Studying From the Home and Host Country During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objective:</b> This study explored the psychological and academic effects of studying online from the home vis-ÃƒÂ -vis host country during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the experience of international students at the University of Warsaw, Poland. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 357 international students from 62 countries (236 in the host country and 121 in the home country) completed an online questionnaire survey 2 months after transition to online learning. We studied students' levels of loneliness, life and academic satisfaction, acculturative stress, academic adjustment, performance, loyalty, and perceptions of the online learning experience. <b>Results:</b> The country-of-residence variable had no statistically significant effects on most psychological and academic variables. Significant effects were observed only for two academic variables. Specifically, students who returned to the home country found online communication with other students more contributing to their online learning experience and exhibited higher academic adjustment than students who remained in the host country. This suggests the positive influence of (peer and familial) support on online learning experience from the home country. Furthermore, a significant difference in experiencing acculturative stress occurred for students in quarantine/self-isolation in the host country, which expands prior literature on the disruptive effects of social distancing on students' mental health. Finally, this study confirmed the expected increased levels of loneliness among self-isolating students in both countries, hence extending prior results to the home- and host-country contexts. No relationship between self-isolation and students' life or academic satisfaction was found, which is explained by the specific nature of the learning-from-home experience.","Wilczewski, Gorbaniuk, Giuri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644096","20210426","COVID-19; academic adjustment; acculturative stress; international students (foreign students); loneliness; online learning; quarantine; satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13201,""
"Educational and Social Exergaming: A Perspective on Physical, Social, and Educational Benefits and Pitfalls of Exergaming at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Afterwards","Physical inactivity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) signify two pandemics with negative physical, mental, and economic consequences. Younger and older people have not reached the recommended physical activity level for years. Societal restrictions due to COVID-19 additionally reduce opportunities for physical activity, and they increase social isolation. Here, we outline how playing exergames with others (social exergaming) at home could foster physical and mental health and promote communication and discussions on exergaming. Accordingly, we highlight the educational and social benefits of exergaming at home and delineate the concept of Educational and Social Exergaming (EASE). We outline specific benefits and pitfalls of exergaming regarding its physical and nonphysical effects, including educational values of discussing exergaming experiences and related topics. Moreover, we discuss the relevance of practical guidelines for educational and social exergaming at home as well as prospects for future research. Overall, educational and social exergaming could alleviate several detrimental effects of both pandemics on the health and well-being of people of all ages.","RÃƒÂ¼th, Kaspar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644036","20210426","COVID-19; exergaming; home exercising; media education; physical activity; social gaming; social learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13202,""
"Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health During COVID-19: Acceptability, Feasibility, and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention","The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (<i>n</i> = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over 1 week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%).

"The Psychological Effect of COVID-19 on Home-Quarantined Nursing Students in China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly caused socioeconomic impacts. However, little is known about the psychological effect of COVID-19 on home-quarantined nursing students. The present study aimed to identify the prevalence and major determinants of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 6,348 home-quarantined nursing students. Mental health status was assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9) and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Check List-Civilian version (PCL-C), respectively. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors of anxiety, depression and PTSS. The overall prevalence of anxiety was 34.97%, and the rates of &quot;mild,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; and &quot;severe&quot; anxiety were 26.24, 7.04, and 1.69%, respectively. Depression was detected in 40.22% of the nursing students, and the prevalence of &quot;mild,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;moderately severe,&quot; and &quot;severe&quot; depression was 27.87, 7.18, 4.08, and 1.09%, respectively. The overall prevalence of PTSS was 14.97%, with the prevalence of &quot;mild&quot; and &quot;moderate-to-severe&quot; PTSS reported at 7.04 and 7.93%, respectively. Male gender and insufficient social support were common risk factors for anxiety, depression and PTSS. In conclusion, about one-third, two-fifths, and one-seventh of Chinese nursing students had anxiety, depression and PTSS during the period of home quarantine, respectively. Timely and appropriate psychological interventions for nursing students should be implemented to reduce the psychological harm caused by COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Zou, Zhang, Zhang, Zhang, Fu, Mao, Cao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.652296","20210426","COVID-19; China; anxiety; depression; nursing students; post-traumatic stress symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13204,""
"Coping With the COVID-19 Pandemic: Examining Gender Differences in Stress and Mental Health Among University Students","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a wide variety of unprecedented challenges, many of which appear to be disproportionately affecting the mental health and well-being of young adults. While there is evidence to suggest university students experience high rates of mental health disorders, less is known about the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health and how they are coping with this stress. To address this gap, we conducted an online study among undergraduate students (<i>n</i> = 366) to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academics, social isolation, and mental health, as well as the extent to which they have been implementing a variety of coping strategies. The pandemic had a more pronounced negative effect on female students' academics, social isolation, stress and mental health compared to male counterparts. Moreover, for females, frequent use of social media as a coping mechanism was associated with greater perceived negative impacts on their academic performance and stress levels, compared to males. However, frequent social media use related to similar negative mental health effects for both males and females. While male and female students both reported using substances to cope, for males the use of cannabis was associated with greater negative impacts on academic outcomes, stress and mental health compared to females. These findings highlight the need for adequate student support services across the post-secondary sector, and point to the importance of gender informed interventions to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Prowse, Sherratt, Abizaid, Gabrys, Hellemans, Patterson, McQuaid","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.650759","20210426","COVID-19; coping; emerging adults; mental health; stress; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13205,""
"Looking Back to Move Forward: Reflections on the Strengths and Challenges of the COVID-19 UK Mental Health Research Response","In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the swift response of mental health research funders and institutions, service providers, and academics enabled progress toward understanding the mental health consequences. Nevertheless, there remains an urgent need to understand the true extent of the short- and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, necessitating ongoing research. Although the speed with which mental health researchers have mobilized to respond to the pandemic so far is to be commended, there are valid concerns as to whether speed may have compromised the quality of our work. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we must take time to reflect on our initial research response and collectively consider how we can use this to strengthen ensuing COVID-19 mental health research and our response to future crises. Here, we offer our reflections as members of the UK mental health research community to discuss the continuing progress and persisting challenges of our COVID-19 response, which we hope can encourage reflection and discussion among the wider research community. We conclude that (1) Fragmentation in our infrastructure has challenged the efficient, effective and equitable deployment of resources, (2) In responding quickly, we may have overlooked the role of experts by experience, (3) Robust and open methods may have been compromised by speedy responses, and (4) This pandemic may exacerbate existing issues of inequality in our workforce.","Demkowicz, Panayiotou, Parsons, Feltham, Arseneault, Ingram, Patalay, Edge, Pierce, Creswell, Victor, O'Connor, Qualter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.622562","20210426","COVID-19 pandemic; coproduction; mental health research; open science; robust methods; workforce inequality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13206,""

"A Proposed Sentiment Analysis Deep Learning Algorithm for Analyzing COVID-19 Tweets","With the rise in cases of COVID-19, a bizarre situation of pressure was mounted on each country to make arrangements to control the population and utilize the available resources appropriately. The swiftly rising of positive cases globally created panic, anxiety and depression among people. The effect of this deadly disease was found to be directly proportional to the physical and mental health of the population. As of 28 October 2020, more than 40 million people are tested positive and more than 1 million deaths have been recorded. The most dominant tool that disturbed human life during this time is social media. The tweets regarding COVID-19, whether it was a number of positive cases or deaths, induced a wave of fear and anxiety among people living in different parts of the world. Nobody can deny the truth that social media is everywhere and everybody is connected with it directly or indirectly. This offers an opportunity for researchers and data scientists to access the data for academic and research use. The social media data contains many data that relate to real-life events like COVID-19. In this paper, an analysis of Twitter data has been done through the R programming language. We have collected the Twitter data based on hashtag keywords, including COVID-19, coronavirus, deaths, new case, recovered. In this study, we have designed an algorithm called Hybrid Heterogeneous Support Vector Machine (H-SVM) and performed the sentiment classification and classified them positive, negative and neutral sentiment scores.

"[Intensive Care Nurses, Psychological Disorders and COVID-19 The COVID IMPACT NATIONAL STUDY]","The COVID-19 pandemic has turned hospital under tension. Front-line staff, those most heavily exposed to the virus, are also those most at risk of developing psychological disorders. The aim of this national survey was to determine the prevalence of psychological disorders among the nurses working in intensive care unit during the pandemic. We developed an electronic questionnaire distributed by email between June 17th and July 17th, 2020. The responders were 381 health care professionals (nurses, anaesthetists nurse, operating room nurses and health managers). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact Event Scale Revisited were used to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Operating Room Nurses were those who suffered the most from psychological disorders: anxiety disorder (64%) (p = 0.055), depression (45%) (p = 0.004) and post-traumatic stress disorder (45%) (p = 0.008). Nurses usually working in intensive care were the least affected by psychological disorders: anxiety disorder (30%), depressive disorder (11%) and post-traumatic stress (20%). The risk factors for developing a psychological disorder are the low level of training in intensive care unit (ICU), not being volunteer for working in ICU and having a burnout history. This study describes a profile of professionals at risk of developing psychological disorders in this setting. Prevention should be based on staff training and psychological support.","Caillet, Allaouchiche","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pratan.2021.04.008","20210426","COVID-19 pandemic; Caregivers; Intensive Care Unit; anxiety; depression; psychological disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13209,""
"The effects of COVID-19 continuous traumatic stressors on mental health and cognitive functioning: A case example from Turkey","There is a need to accurately assess the specific impacts of the various traumatic stressors caused by COVID-19 on mental health. The goal was to evaluate the impact of different types of COVID-19 stressors (infection fears, lockdown, and economic stressors) on mental health and cognitive functioning. We used a sample of 262 Turkish adults. We administered an online questionnaire that included measures of COVID-19 traumatic stressors, PTSD, depression, anxiety, executive function deficits, and cumulative stressors and traumas (CST). The analyses included correlations, hierarchical regression, path analysis, and PROCESS mediation analysis. All COVID-19 traumatic stressors types and their cumulative load predicted PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits after controlling for previous cumulative stressors and traumas and COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 lockdown's stressors were the strongest predictors, compared to COVID-19 fears and economic stressors. Path analysis and PROCESS mediation results indicated that COVID-19 traumatic stressors had direct effects on working memory deficits, direct and indirect effects on PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and indirect effects on inhibition deficits. Anxiety, depression, and inhibition deficits mediated its indirect effects on PTSD. The results have conceptual and clinical implications. COVID-19 continuous posttraumatic stress syndrome that includes comorbid PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits is different and does not fit within the current trauma frameworks. There is a need for a paradigm shift in current stress and trauma frameworks to account for the COVID-19 continuous global stressors and for clinical innovations in intervention to help its victims.

"Effects of restraining measures due to COVID-19: Pre- and post-lockdown cognitive status and mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted all countries to adopt restraining measures to mitigate the spread of the disease. Usually, large-scale disasters tend to be accompanied by significant increases of psychological distress, depression and anxiety. Confinement measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have similar consequences. In the present study we aim to evaluate how COVID-19 affected the overall psychological functioning of Portuguese individuals by providing a comparison of current data with status prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study sample was composed of 150 cognitively healthy participants. Results show an overall maintenance of cognitive capacities, although subjective cognitive decline complaints significantly increased during the pandemic. Regarding mental health, restraining measures culminated in an aggravation of depressive and decrease of the perceived quality of life, associated with feelings of loneliness and perceived social isolation. Finally, higher levels of pre-COVID-19 quality of life seem to play a protective role against depression and anxiety and predict less difficulties in emotion regulation, feelings of solitude and cognitive complaints. In sum, confinement due to COVID-19 implied an aggravation of the mental health of the Portuguese population, which appears to have been attenuated in those with higher pre-pandemic levels of perceived quality of life.","Nogueira, Gerardo, Silva, Pinto, Barbosa, Soares, Baptista, Paquete, Cabral-Pinto, Vilar, SimÃƒÂµes, Freitas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01747-y","20210426","Aging; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cognition; Depression; Loneliness; Mental health; Pandemic; Quality of life; Social restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13211,""
"Caregivers' joint depressive symptoms and preschoolers' daily routines in Chinese three-generation families: Does household chaos matter?","The benefits of routines for children have been consistently demonstrated in previous literature. However, factors that may confer risks for child routines have seldom been examined, particularly in families where parents and grandparents co-care the children. This study aimed to investigate the associations of parents' and grandparents' depressive symptoms with preschoolers' daily routines in Chinese three-generation families and to determine whether household chaos mediated or moderated the associations. The participants were from 171 urban three-generation families where mothers, fathers, and grandmothers (97 paternal and 74 maternal) were primary caregivers. Mothers, fathers, and grandmothers reported their depressive symptoms at Wave 1; at Wave 2 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), caregivers reported household chaos and child routines. The results revealed that child routines were negatively predicted by parents' joint depressive symptoms rather than grandmothers' depressive symptoms. In the associations, household chaos acted as a mediator rather than a moderator. Specifically, household chaos marginally mediated the associations between parents' and grandmothers' depressive symptoms and child routines only in maternal three-generation families. These findings suggest that in three-generation families, caregivers with more depressive symptoms may elicit more chaotic family environments, which may in turn compromise their children's daily routines.","Jiang, He, Lin, Zhou, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01595-w","20210426","Child routines; Depressive symptoms; Household chaos; Three-generation families","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13212,""

"Going Virtual During a Pandemic: An Academic Psychiatry Department's Experience with Telepsychiatry","The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) led healthcare providers, including mental health providers, across the U.S. to swiftly shift to telemedicine. This shift gave our Department of Psychiatry a chance to better understand key challenges and opportunities vis-ÃƒÂ -vis virtual mental healthcare. We aimed to obtain provider feedback on the use of telepsychiatry and to learn from the provider perspective about patient experiences with video visits. This information will be used to inform the telemedicine strategy at a systems level within our psychiatry department, our academic health system, as well as the field of telemedicine as a whole. A 22-item online questionnaire comprising 16 quantitative and six qualitative items was distributed to providers currently using video visits to provide care. A total of 89 mental health providers completed the questionnaire. Outcomes demonstrated that while providers perceive challenges associated with virtual care (e.g., fatigue, technology-related issues, and age-related concerns), they also recognize a number of benefits to themselves and their patients (e.g., convenience and increased access). Overall, provider satisfaction, comfort, and willingness to use telepsychiatry was high. The vast majority of providers adapted quickly to the use of virtual platforms; many endorse advantages that suggest virtual care will continue to be a modality they provide in the future, post-COVID-19. It will be important to continue to evaluate aspects of virtual care that may limit clinical assessments and to optimize use to improve access, convenience, and cost-efficiency of mental healthcare delivery.","Parikh, Taubman, Grambeau, Menke, Blazek, Sullivan, Severe, Patel, Dalack","https://www.google.com/search?q=Going+Virtual+During+a+Pandemic:+An+Academic+Psychiatry+Department's+Experience+with+Telepsychiatry.","20210426","COVID-19; coronavirus; e-Health; mental health; pandemic; psychiatry; service delivery systems; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13214,""

We attribute this increased depression to the restrictive measures on activities, visits, and physical contact between patients with AD and family members during the lockdown.","Haj, Moustafa, Gallouj","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-210190","20210426","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; COVID-19; depression; lockdown; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13215,""
"Detecting the Relationship between the Stress Levels and Perceived Burnout in Law-enforcement Officers during the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-sectional Study","The present study aimed to determine the effect of burnout and stress levels on law enforcement officers' perceptions and behaviors to emphasize the need for adequate attention and care in these individuals during the COVID-19 outbreak. The research group of this cross-sectional study conducted in July-August 2020 was formed by the law enforcement officers. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Burnout Measure-Short Version (BM-SV) and a personal data form prepared by the researchers were used in the study. Data were analyzed using the IBM <i>SPSS</i> Statistics 16.0 software package program. The PSS scores were higher and significant in the group whose working hours were not increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and they thought that there was a decrease in crime rates and did not need psychological support (pÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â .05). The PSS scores were higher and significant in the group who took the warnings about COVID-19 into consideration, were afraid of contracting the virus, did not care about the progress of the epidemic and used the mask correctly. Additionally, the BM-SV scores were higher and significant in the group who stated that they were not afraid of contracting the virus (pÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤.05). A comprehensive crisis prevention and intervention system including epidemiological monitoring/observing, screening, referral and targeted interventions should be established to reduce the perceived level of stress and burnout in law enforcement and prevent further mental health problems.","Sener, Arikan, GÃƒÂ¼ndÃƒÂ¼z, GÃƒÂ¼lekci","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2021.1915910","20210426","COVID-19; burnout; law enforcement officers; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13216,""

"Experiences of critical care nurses fighting against COVID-19: A qualitative phenomenological study","This study sought to describe the experiences of critical care nurses caring for patients infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A qualitative phenomenological design was used. We enrolled 15 nurses who provided care for patients infected by COVID-19 purposively and through snowballing, using a phenomenological approach in critical care units of Iran's public hospitals between May and June 2020. The semi-structured interviews were carried out either via face-to-face or telephone and were analyzed using the 7-step method of Colaizzi. The experiences of nurses caring for patients infected with COVID-19 were categorized into four challenges, including psychological (eight subthemes), organizational (six subthemes), social (six subthemes), and professional (five subthemes). In general, based on the current classification, there seems to be a mixture of positive and negative effects on the psychological, social, and professional challenges and the negative effect only on the organizational challenges. Positive and negative emotions and experiences have coexisted for the critical care nurses since the COVID-19 outbreak. Emotional support and psychological counseling play an important role in maintaining nurses' optimal mental health during the COVID-19 crisis. Adequate protective equipment, financial and nonfinancial supports, effective communication, training and hiring of staff, and appropriate work shifts are also required to reduce nurses' negative experiences when providing care for the affected individuals.","Chegini, Arab-Zozani, Rajabi, Kakemam","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12583","20210425","COVID-19; challenges; critical care; experience; nurse; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13218,""
"Psychological assessment and lived experiences of recovered COVID-19 patients who presented for convalescent plasma donation","Increasingly, it has been seen that patients recovering from COVID-19 may face a second battle of coping with its mental health ramifications. These psychological issues can even be experienced by patients who were asymptomatic or had mild to moderate symptoms, potentially impacting their quality of life. This was a prospective observational study to analyse the psychological impact of COVID-19 in recovered patients who presented as prospective convalescent plasma (CP) donors. An interview for the psychological assessment of the prospective donors was carried out. Depression and anxiety in the participants were assessed by HAM-A, and HAM-D scores and Quality of Life were assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF scale. A total of 51 prospective donors were assessed, with a mean age of 34.37 (Ã‚Â±9.08) years, with the majority being males (46). No clinically significant depression and anxiety were found on the basis of HAM-D and HAM-A scores. The worst affected quality of life parameter, based on the WHOQOL-BREF scale, was physical quality of life followed by environmental, psychological, and social relationships. Moreover, due to infection, social stigma was experienced by 49.02% of the donors, while 21.97% had anxiety related to convalescent plasma donation as a common livid experience. Poor quality of life and social stigma during the recovery phase is prevalent in COVID-19 recovered patients, for which formulation of holistic support strategies are the need of the hour.","Maheshwari, Varshney, Gupta, Bajpai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tracli.2021.04.008","20210425","COVID-19; Convalescent Plasma Donor; Lived Experiences; Psychological status; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13219,""
"The psychosocial impact on frontline nurses of caring for patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in New York City","Infectious disease pandemics, such as COVID-19, have dramatically increased in the last several decades. To investigate the personal and contextual factors associated with the psychological functioning of nurses responding to COVID in the New York City area. Cross sectional data collected via a 95-item internet-based survey sent to an email list of the 7,219 nurses employed at four hospitals. 2,495 nurses responded (RR 35%). The more that nurses cared for COVID patients as well as experienced home-work conflict and work-home conflict the higher the nurses' depression and anxiety. When asked what has helped the nurses to carry out their care of patients the most common responses were support from and to co-workers, training in proper PPE, and support from family/friends. Understanding the potential triggers and vulnerability factors can inform the development of institutional resources that would help minimize their impact, reducing the risk of psychological morbidity.","Kovner, Raveis, Van Devanter, Yu, Glassman, Ridge","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2021.03.019","20210425","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemics; Nurse's role","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13220,""
"Associations between COVID-19 perceptions, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among adults living in the United States","Associations among illness perceptions of viruses, anxiety and depression symptoms, and self-management decisions, such as mask-wearing, are critical to informing public health practices to mitigate the short- and long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic. Guided by the common-sense model of self-regulation, this observational study examined associations among illness perceptions of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression symptoms among community-dwelling adults. Data were collected from 1380 adults living in the United States early in the pandemic (03-23-2020 to 06-02-2020). Participants completed online surveys. Analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics and correlations. While increased anxiety symptoms were associated with less perceived personal control, greater concern, and higher emotional responsiveness, increased depression symptoms were related to lower concern as well as greater emotional responsiveness and perceived consequences of the pandemic. Associations among illness perceptions, anxiety, and depression symptoms may impact viral spread mitigation behavior adoption.","Wierenga, Moore, Pressler, Hacker, Perkins","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2021.03.020","20210425","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Illness Perceptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13221,""

"The effect of prohibiting outside food during COVID-19 pandemic on the body weight of schizophrenic patients taking olanzapine or clozapine: a retrospective self-controlled study","Olanzapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) with the greatest risk of weight gain, and changes in feeding behavior are among the most important underlying mechanisms. However, few studies have investigated the role of diet-alone interventions in improving individuals' weight gain by taking AAPs. In closed management mental hospitals of China, family members are allowed to bring food to patients regularly, causing patients to have caloric intake added to their 3 daily meals. However, during the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bringing food to the hospital was temporarily prohibited in mental health institutions in China to prevent the spread of the virus. This study sought to compare the body weight and body mass index (BMI) changes of patients taking olanzapine or clozapine undergoing diet-alone interventions caused by this prohibition. A retrospective self-controlled study was conducted on 90 patients with schizophrenia from a single-center treated with olanzapine or clozapine monotherapy, or combined with aripiprazole or ziprasidone which has a small metabolic impact. A paired-samples t-test was used to compare the changes in body weight and BMI before and after the 3-month prohibition, and general linear regression was used to analyze the effects of gender, age, disease course, duration of drug exposure, and equivalent dose on the BMI improvement. Also, the percentage of people who lost weight and that of individuals who lost 5% of their pre-prohibition body weight were calculated. Paired-samples t-test showed that after 3-month prohibition, the patients' body weight (71.68Ã‚Â±6.83 vs. 66.91Ã‚Â±7.03, P&lt;0.001) and BMI (26.43Ã‚Â±2.11 vs. 24.63Ã‚Â±1.81, P&lt;0.001) decreased significantly. Weight loss rate accounted for 99.1%, and weight loss of 5% from the pre-prohibition body weight accounted for 71.8%. General linear regression showed that the duration of drug exposure (ÃŽÂ² =-0.678, P&lt;0.001) was significantly and negatively correlated with the BMI changes. No significant correlation of gender, age, disease course, or equivalent dose with BMI changes was found. Diet-alone interventions facilitate weight loss in chronically hospitalized schizophrenia patients taking AAPs. Conduction of dietary intervention in the early stages of medication may yield greater benefits.","Zhang, Wang, Hu, Ding, Li, Wu, Hu, Wang, Sun","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2513","20210425","COVID-19 pandemic; caloric restriction; clozapine; olanzapine; weight","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13223,""
"COVID-19 pandemic: pain, quality of life and impact on public health in the confinement in Spain","Given the uncontrolled increase of those affected by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, COVID-19, and the possibility of the health system collapsing in Spain, the Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14th, declared a state of alarm for the management of this health crisis. The whole population, despite their social background, were confined inside their homes during this arduous situation. There are numerous articles that endorse the idea that their home conditions, the number of people with whom they coexist with, their employment, gender, amount of physical exercise, as well as their body mass index and their diagnosis in COVID-19 are characteristics that may represent an increased risk of suffering pain and changes in their quality of life. We proposed a study to determine the impact of the confinement on pain, quality of life and public health of the Spanish population due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An observational study was carried out during April and May 2020 through an online survey. It was statistically analysed through descriptive analysis and inferential analysis by bivariate logistic regression, ordinal logistic and Pearson's chi square. A total of 225 questionnaires were obtained between April and May 2020. For subjects suffering pain before confinement, significant relationships were drawn between experiencing pain and work-related activities (P=0.006), as well as, physical activity or the absence of it (P=0.033). In addition, an important association between experiencing pain and gender was discovered, both for people suffering pain before and during confinement (P=0.007 and P=0.011). Furthermore, the confinement has affected the quality of life of those affected, particularly in relation with suffering pain before and during confinement (P=0.001 and P=0.000), Job type (P=0.016) and BMI (P=0.025) and affecting more Physical Role, Emotional Role and Mental Health, followed by Physical Function. The presence of pain in subjects undergoing confinement is persistent, with varying intensity and frequency based on age, gender, physical activity, and work status. In any of these conditions, the quality of life of the subjects in confinement has been severely affected, which to this day creates a severe public health problem.","Iglesias-LÃƒÂ³pez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Isidoro, Castellanos-SÃƒÂ¡nchez","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2514","20210425","COVID-19; pain; quality of life; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-27","",13224,""
"COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs and their relationship with perceived stress and pre-existing conspiracy beliefs in a Prolific Academic sample: A replication and extension of Georgiou et al (2020)","The authors conducted a close replication of a study by Georgiou et al (2020), who found amongst 660 (reported in abstract) or 640 (reported in participant section) participants that 1) Covid-19 related conspiracy theory beliefs were strongly related to broader conspiracy theory beliefs, that 2) Covid-19 related conspiracy beliefs were higher in those with lower levels of education, and that 3) Covid-19 related conspiracy beliefs were positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards different individual items measuring the governmentâ€™s response. Finally, they find that 4) Covid-19 beliefs were unrelated to self-reported stress. In a pre-registered replication and extension in a study sufficiently well-powered to detect f2 = 0.05, at an alpha level of .05, with an a priori power of .95, and with 5 Predictors in a multiple regression analysis, we do not find the same results. First, we find that education level is unrelated to Covid-19 related conspiracy beliefs, that stress is related to Covid-19 related conspiracy beliefs, but that the governmentâ€™s response is indeed related to Covid-19 related conspiracy beliefs. We point out measurement problems in measuring conspiracy beliefs, extend the study through supervised machine learning by finding that attachment avoidance and anxiety are important predictors of conspiracy beliefs (Covid-19-related and beyond).
