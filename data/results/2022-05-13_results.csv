"Testimonies during the pandemic: psychoanalytic reflections on trauma, State, economy and death; Testemunhos durante a pandemia: reflexÃµes psicanalÃ­ticas sobre trauma, Estado, economia e morte","Resumo Este trabalho propÃµe-se a refletir sobre a experiÃªncia do sujeito perante a pandemia de covid-19 por meio de uma perspectiva psicanalÃ­tica. O material analisado discursivamente foi constituÃ­do por testemunhos de estudantes de graduaÃ§Ã£o em psicologia publicados em um espaÃ§o virtual durante o perÃ­odo de distanciamento social. Os processos de subjetivaÃ§Ã£o destacados em nossa anÃ¡lise foram discutidos em quatro nÃºcleos temÃ¡ticos: enfrentar o potencial traumÃ¡tico: poder testemunhar a queda do Outro; o (des)amparo dos sujeitos por parte do Estado: a potencializaÃ§Ã£o do sofrimento psÃ­quico; o imperativo superegoico da produÃ§Ã£o capitalista e os vestÃ­gios produtivos da improdutividade; (im)possibilidades do luto: transformaÃ§Ãµes da nossa atitude diante da morte. Ao fim, buscamos evidenciar criticamente o aspecto destrutivo e autoritÃ¡rio da gestÃ£o estatal dos afetos sobre os sujeitos e a potÃªncia transformativa (analÃ­tica e polÃ­tica) das experiÃªncias da improdutividade, da indeterminaÃ§Ã£o e do desamparo.; Abstract This study aims to reflect on subject's experience in the face of the covid-19 pandemic from a psychoanalytic perspective. The material discursively analyzed was constituted by testimonies of undergraduate psychology students published in a website during the period of social distancing. The subjectivation processes emphasized in our analysis were discussed in four thematic groups: facing the traumatic potential: being able to witness the fall of the Other; the (un)protection of the subjects by the State: the potentiation of psychological suffering; the superegoic imperative of capitalist production and the productive traces of unproductivity; and (im)possibilities of mourning: changes in our attitude towards death. Finally, we seek to critically evidence the destructive and authoritarian aspect of the state management of affections on subjects and the transformative power (analytical and political) of the experiences of unproductivity, indeterminacy, and helplessness.","Departamento de PsicologiaSouza Junior, Luiz Alberto de; Departamento de PsicologiaHenderson, Guilherme Freitas","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0104-12902021000300308","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: SaÃºde Soc;30(3): e200435, 2021.; Humans; Male; Female; Psychoanalysis; Coronavirus; Social Theory; Psychological Distress; Physical Distancing; COVID-19","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31275,""
"Changing landscape of respiratory conduct and its stressful impact during covid-19 crisis","Background: The country was placed under a nationwide lockdown on April 1st, which was then extended twice more until May 9th. When the lockdown came to an end, it was gradually lifted. Following the initial wave, the nation has fought COVID-19 by implementing ""smart lockdowns"" and enforcing standard operating procedures (SOPs). Aims: To assess participants' respiratory etiquette, anxiety, and depression in the context of the COVID pandemic after the constraint of lockdown has been lifted. Methods: From May 2020 to February 2021, a total of 120 participants participated in this cross-sectional study. Data collection is done through the use of a proforma. Anxiety and depression were measured using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales, which were used in conjunction with each other. It was disseminated by a deliberate snowball sampling procedure. Consent was obtained through the use of Google Forms. Results: Only 30 percent of the 120 participants wore a mask at all times. Anxiety and despair were experienced by 49 percent and 42 percent of those surveyed, respectively. Anxiety and depression were shown to be related with 35-50 year old females, HCPs, and family members who tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusions: Following the lockdown, participants' respiratory hygiene etiquette may have deteriorated, maybe due to their decreased anxiety about COVID-19 infection. Females, HCPs, and family members who tested positive for COVID-19 were shown to have higher levels of anxiety and sadness than other groups.","Mudassar, S.; Ali, M.; Habib, B.; Bashir, F.; Ahmed, S.; Mubeen, A.; Nisar, U.","https://doi.org/10.53350/pjmhs22163222","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Medical and Health Sciences; 16(3):222-223, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31276,""
"Pandemi SÃ¼recinde Konya &Iacute;linde Yasayan Yasli Bireylerde Meydana Gelen Sosyal ve Psikolojik Degisimlerin Peyzaj Mimarligi AÃ§isindan Degerlendirilmesi","Covid-19, which affects the whole world and is accepted as a pandemic by the world health organization, caused millions of people to die. The elderly are in the group with the highest risk of losing their lives due to the Covid-19 virus. Stricter restrictive / protective measures have been taken for the elderly in Turkey, as in the whole world. With this research, it is aimed to evaluate the sociological and psychological effects of the ""elderly"", who are one of the health risk groups of the society, in terms of landscape architecture, during the pandemic days when they had to experience various problems after the outbreak. In the study, face-to-face and online questionnaires were applied to individuals aged 50 and over on a voluntary basis. As a result of the study, it was determined that the implementation of curfews and restrictions for the elderly and the formation of an isolated lifestyle from other age groups caused an increase in loneliness and anxiety levels and negative psychological effects. It has been revealed that the activities that individuals will carry out in the green area, their conversations and socializing with their peers, and walks in the open area have a positive psychological and sociological effect for the elderly. It has been determined that the elderly who become lonely and depressed at home with the restrictions imposed under pandemic conditions want to be in green areas. The sociological and psychological positive effects of being in green areas and spending time, and the changes in the behaviour and emotions of the elderly who have pandemic restrictions paralleled the response of the participants to the questionnaire.","GÃ¼ngÃ¶r, SertaÃ§, BÃ¼tÃ¼ner, Fatma","https://doi.org/10.24925/turjaf.v9isp.2458-2465.4863","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Turkish Journal of Agriculture - Food Science and Technology; 9(sp):2458-2465, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31277,""
"Assessment of Psychological Impact on the Health Care Workers due to Covid-19 Pandemic in Tertiary Care Hospitals of Karachi","OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workers in tertiary care hospitals of Karachi. METHODOLOGY: This is a multicentric cross-sectional study conducted at tertiary care hospitals of Karachi (Pakistan). A total of 350 health care workers, including both males and females, from different private and Government tertiary care hospitals, were approached and enrolled after fulfilling the selection criteria from May to Aug 2020. The semi-structured Performa was used for demographic details while the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD 7) were administered to evaluate depression and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: Out of 350 participants, 220 (62.8%) have depression in this study, while 206 (58.8%) have anxiety. The degree of depression was mild in 81 (23.1%) of health care workers, moderate in59 (16.8%), moderately severe in 50 (14.2%), severe in 30 (8.6%). Similarly, mild anxiety was present in 75 (21.4%), moderate in 74 (21.1%), and severe anxiety in 57 (16.3%) persons. The most common problem they faced is -Fear of transmission of disease family /close friends, being present in 311 (88.9%) p-value = 0.014. CONCLUSION: It is evident that health care workers are affected with depression and anxiety due to pandemic. It is necessary to take appropriate steps to manage the psychological impact of the stress to be more productive in their respective fields.","Mahmood, K.; Feroz, S.; Nisa, Z. U.; Raza, M.

"Income, ethnic diversity and family life in East London during the first wave of the pandemic: an assets approach","Objective: This paper reports first results from a survey of 992 parents and parents to be living in an ethnically diverse and socio-economically unequal borough of East London during the coronavirus pandemic that reduced mobility, closed services and threatened public health. Background: Little is known about the place based impacts of the pandemic on families with young children. We describe the living circumstances of families with children under five or expecting a baby living in Tower Hamlets during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and then examine the relative importance of household characteristics such as ethnicity and household income for adverse impacts on survey respondents, as seen in mental health outcomes. Method: a community survey sample recruited with support from the local council comprised 75% mothers/pregnant women, 25% fathers/partners of pregnant women. Reflecting the borough population, 35 percent were White British or Irish and 36 percent were Bangladeshi, and the remainder were from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Adopting an assets based approach, we describe material, familial and community assets using three household income bands and seven ethnic groups. We then use regressions to identify which assets were most important in mitigating adversity. Results: We find that material assets (income, employment, food insecurity, housing quality) were often insecure and in decline but familial assets (home caring practices, couple relationships) were largely sustained. Community assets (informal support, service provision) were less available or means of access had changed. Our analyses find that while descriptively ethnicity structured adverse impacts of the pandemic related changes to family life, income and couple relationships were the most important assets for mitigating adversity as seen in mental health status. Conclusion: Supporting family assets will require close attention to generating local and decent work as well as enhancing access to community assets.","Cameron, C.; O'Brien, M.; Whitaker, L.; Hollingworth, K.; Hauari, H.","https://doi.org/10.20377/jfr-725","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Jfr-Journal of Family Research; 34(1):221-248, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31282,""
"Who suffered most? Parental stress and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","Objective: This study examines gender and socioeconomic inequalities in parental psychological wellbeing (parenting stress and psychological distress) during the COVID19 pandemic in Germany. Background: The dramatic shift of childcare and schooling responsibility from formal institutions to private households during the pandemic has put families under enormous stress and raised concerns about caregivers' health and wellbeing. Despite the overwhelming media attention to families' wellbeing, to date limited research has examined parenting stress and parental psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Germany. Method: We analyzed four waves of panel data (N= 1,771) from an opt-in online survey, which was conducted between March 2020 and April 2021. Multivariable OLS regressions were used to estimate variations in the pandemic's effects on parenting stress and psychological distress by various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results: Overall, levels of parenting stress and psychological distress increased during the pandemic. During the first and third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, mothers, parents with children younger than 11 years, parents with two or more children, parents working from home as well as parents with financial insecurity experienced higher parenting stress than other sociodemographic groups. Moreover, women, respondents with lower incomes, single parents, and parents with younger children experienced higher levels of psychological distress than other groups. Conclusion: Gender and socioeconomic inequalities in parents' psychological wellbeing increased among the study participants during the pandemic.","Li, J.

"COVID-19 and the Brain: Infection Mechanisms, Electroencephalographic Findings and Clinical Implications","The term long-COVID refers to a wide array of psychological impacts arising from infection with the Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has been reported to attack the nervous system directly, with nondirect impacts to organs and systems, such as elevated inflammation, blood pressure, and immune responses also damaging the brain. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used to image these insults and provides a valuable tool to guide understanding of infection mechanisms and, consequentially, therapeutic intervention. Due to the high likelihood of neurological complications, neurofeedback and other forms of neuromodulation may be particularly well suited to help long-COVID patients recover. However, clinicians providing neuromodulation interventions should be aware of, and take adequate steps to minimize, risks to themselves and others in providing face-to-face services. This review seeks to provide mental health professionals with an overview of the impacts of COVID-19 upon the nervous system, details current EEG findings, and outlines possibly relevant neurofeedback and neuromodulation interventions.","Rountree-Harrison, D.","https://doi.org/10.15540/NR.9.1.48","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: NeuroRegulation; 9(1):48-66, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31284,""
"Editorial: From Exceptional Cases to Everyday Abuses: Labour exploitation in the global economy","[...]of these measures, hundreds of millions of workers have been deprived of their usual incomes. First and foremost, it has become clear that the burdens associated with the pandemic have fallen much harder on some categories of people than others. Despite claims that flexible working arrangements are mutually beneficial, these workers typically have 'no job security, in-work benefits, or labour rights, and are very vulnerable to the whims of employers'.6 Platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk are able to leverage their market position to depress wages and conditions.7 Not all digital work is inherently exploitative, but the deck is nonetheless heavily stacked against most workers thanks to the challenges associated with collective organising, competition, jurisdictional challenges, and limited regulation. Guy Standing, for example, has theorised 'the creation of a global ""precariat""', which he portrays as an emerging class within the global economy that is collectively defined by a shared lack of labour-related security.13 While there is broad agreement that vulnerability and insecurity are foundational themes, Standing's critics have questioned the extent to which this singular framework smooths over differences in context and circumstances.","Quirk, Joel, Robinson, Caroline, Thibos, Cameron","https://doi.org/10.14197/atr.201220151","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Anti - Trafficking Review; - (15):1-19, 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31285,""
"Depression in Ibero-America in the COVID-19 context: An analysis of scientific production in Scopus","Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems such as depression have increased in the general population and health care personnel. Objective: Describe the characteristics of publications on depression in the COVID-19 context, with authors affiliated to Ibero-American institutions. Method. The study describes the main characteristics of the publications on depression in the Covid-19 context conduct-ed by authors affiliated to Ibero-American institutions. A retro-spective and descriptive analysis of 1,072 articles indexed in the Scopus database between January 2020 and September 2021 was performed. Results. The results show that original and review articles are the most carried out. Spain is the Ibero-American coun-try that contributes the largest number of scientific articles on depression, representing 33.68% of the Ibero-American production, followed by Brazil and Portugal, countries that exceed 10.00% of the production. The authors are mainly affiliated with institutions in Brazil, Spain and Portugal. Also, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health and Frontiers in Psychology are the journals with the largest number of publications. The most cited article is doc-umentary review and was published by authors affiliated with Ibero-American institutions in Brazil and Paraguay. Finally, it was found that the most used keywords were the descriptors depression, mental health, pandemic and Covid-19. Conclusions. The scientific production on depression is un-equal, and it is important to consolidate the scientific literature through collaborative networks between researchers and institutions in Ibero-America.","Saavedra-LÃ³pez, M.

"Anxiety and depression in medical and non-medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic","Objective: To explore the factors associate with anxiety and depression in medical and non-medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Online questionnaires were distributed through the We Chat official account, and a total of 387 people were surveyed, including 170 medical personnel and 217 non-medical personnel. The contents of the questionnaires included General Situation Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale ( GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale ( CD-RISC-10). Lo gistic regression was employed to analyze the influencing factors of anxiety and depression. Results: The detection rates of depression and anxiety were 42. 9% and 46. 5% respectively in the medical staff, and 62. 7% and 52. 5% in the non-medical staff respectively. Among all the surveyed persons, non-medical personnel (OR = 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 36 - 0. 93, P &lt; 0. 05) were risk factors for depression, and contacting (suspected) infected persons (OR = 2. 63, 95% CI: 1. 43 -4. 85, P &lt; 0. 01) was a risk factor for anxiety. Poor mental resilience was ariskfor depressive mood (Medical staff: OR = 10. 36, 95% Cl: 3. 46 - 31. 05, P &lt; 0. 001;Non-medical staff: OR = 17. 14, 95% Cl: 6. 39 45. 97, P &lt;0. 001) and anxiety (Medical staff: OR= 14. 30, 95%Cl: 4. 68 -43. 69, P &lt;0. 001;Non-medical staff: OR = 11. 18, 95% Cl: 4. 65 - 26. 92, P &lt; 0. 001). Conclusion: It suggests that during the COVID-19 epidemic both medical staff and non-medical staff experience a certain degree of anxiety and depression. The lower the mental re silience is, the higher the risk of anxiety and depression.

"Factors Related to Depression among Caregivers Attending Post-Ischemic Stroke Patients","BACKGROUND: Stroke is known as chronic disease, leading to disability which makes help from caregivers become necessary. Attending stroke patients possess certain challenges and burdens toward the caregivers. AIM: We aim to investigate risk factors related to depression among caregivers attending post-ischemic stroke. METHODS: Eighty-three caregivers and post-ischemic stroke patients were collected consecutively from the Neurology Department of Universitas Sumatera Utara Hospital, Medan, Indonesia. Linear regression was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Our multivariate study shows that patientâ€™s age, caregiverâ€™s gender, patientâ€™s gender, and modified Barthel Index are associated with depression with adjusted R2 of 59.3%.

"The Psychological Condition of Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic at a Referral Hospital in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia","BACKGROUND: The significant increase in positive cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia has increased the number of health care personnel, nurses, and physicians who have been exposed to the virus, which raises the psychological burden on health professionals. AIM: This study aims to analyze the relationship between the psychological responses of health professionals and anxiety/depression in the hospital using the Fear of COVID-19 scales and the hospital anxiety and depression scale, respectively. METHODS: The method is quantitative with a cross-sectional survey, which uses an online questionnaire involving about 207 health professionals working at the COVID-19 referral hospital. RESULTS: The result of the Pearson correlation test showed that the highest fear level of health professionals against COVID-19 was 41.5%, while the highest anxiety and depression levels are at the usual level of 76.3% and 60.4%, respectively. There was a direct relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and anxiety or depression, with significant values of 0.000 or 0.026, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the significance of the psychological state of health professionals during a pandemic. Therefore, the government must provide mental support to health professionals through counselling and more accurate and up-to-date information.","Said, A.; Novianti, A.

"The â€œHealthcare Workersâ€™ Wellbeing [Benessere Operatori]â€ Project: A Longitudinal Evaluation of Psychological Responses of Italian Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: COVID-19 forced healthcare workers to work in unprecedented and critical circumstances, exacerbating already-problematic and stressful working conditions. The â€œHealthcare workersâ€™ wellbeing (Benessere Operatori)â€ project aimed at identifying psychological and personal factors, influencing individualsâ€™ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: 291 healthcare workers took part in the project by answering an online questionnaire twice (after the first wave of COVID-19 and during the second wave) and completing questions on socio-demographic and work-related information, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Brief Cope. Results: Higher levels of worry, worse working conditions, a previous history of psychiatric illness, being a nurse, older age, and avoidant and emotion-focused coping strategies seem to be risk factors for healthcare workersâ€™ mental health. High levels of perceived social support, the attendance of emergency training, and problem-focused coping strategies play a protective role. Conclusions: An innovative, and more flexible, data mining statistical approach (i.e., a regression trees approach for repeated measures data) allowed us to identify risk factors and derive classification rules that could be helpful to implement targeted interventions for healthcare workers.","Perego, G.; Cugnata, F.; Brombin, C.; Milano, F.; Preti, E.; Di Pierro, R.; De Panfilis, C.; Madeddu, F.; Di Mattei, V.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Well-Being of College Students","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an overall increase in stress and depression in society. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the psychological condition of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore factors influencing their daily functioning. The study focused on four main aspects such as mental well-being, sexuality, concern about financial status, and trust in medical authorities. The study was based on a specially designed survey. The questionnaire was created using Google Forms and shared on social media sites. A total of 630 students participated in the survey, 17 surveys were excluded due to incomplete data and 613 surveys (97.30%) were considered for the final analysis. During isolation, 68.0% of students experienced fear of missing out (FOMO). A total of 73.4% were frustrated due to spending a lot of time in front of a computer. A significant decrease in motivation to study was reported by 78.1% of the respondents. Students showed significantly different attitudes towards sexuality. Concern about the financial situation was reported by 48.7% of respondents. The state of the Polish economy was of concern to 86.4% of respondents. A total of 74.5% of students declared concern about their career development. During the pandemic, 59.0% of respondents became concerned about their health. The attitude towards vaccination was described as positive by 82.5% of the respondents. The percentage of respondents experiencing negative psychological effects relative to the overall epidemiological situation of COVID-19 is troubling. Given the unexpected length and severity of the pandemic, we suggest that studentsâ€™ concerns be more thoroughly understood and addressed.","Sauer, N.; Salek, A.; Szlasa, W.; Ciecielag, T.; Obara, J.; Gawel, S.; Marciniak, D.; Karlowicz-Bodalska, K.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095089","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31291,""
"Motherâ€™s Loneliness: Involuntary Separation of Pregnant Women in Maternity Care Settings and Its Effects on The Experience of Mothers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of the study was to investigate the challenges of involuntary separation experienced by women during pregnancy and childbirth in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted by the means of a self-administered questionnaire. One thousand and eleven women (1011) from Poland took part in the study, with an average age of approximately 30 years. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Warmia and Mazury University in Olsztyn, Poland. The results show that the majority of the surveyed women experienced involuntary separation from their partners during pregnancy and childbirth: 66.27% had no choice but to give birth alone and 84.37% had not been able to attend medical appointments with their partners. Solitary encounters with healthcare were associated with the feeling of fear (36.4%), anger (41%), a sense of injustice (52.2%), acute sadness (36.6%) and a sense of loss (42.6%), with all the reported levels higher in younger women. Over 74% of respondents were afraid of childbirth without a partner present. Almost 70% felt depressed because of a lonely delivery experience. Nearly a quarter of the mothers surveyed declared that if they could go back in time, they would not have made the decision to become pregnant during the pandemic. Based on our study, we found that adjustments to prenatal and neonatal care arrangements under COVID-19-related regimens are needed. Our pro-posal is to implement at least three fundamental actions: (1) risk calculations for pandemic-related cautionary measures should take into account the benefits of the accompanied medical appointments and births, which should be restored and maintained if plausible;(2) medical personnel should be pre-trained to recognise and respond to the needs of patients as a part of crisis prepared-ness. If the situation does not allow the patient to stay with her family during important moments of maternity care, other forms of contact, including new technologies, should be used;(3) psychological consultation should be available to all patients and their partners. These solutions should be included in the care plan for pregnant women, taking into account a risk-benefit assessment.","Malarkiewicz, P.; Maksymowicz, S.; Libura, M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095081","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31292,""
"Sleep and Health-Related Characteristics among Adolescents during COVID-19: An Update","Two opposing effects on adolescentsâ€™ health during COVID-19 lockdown have been de-scribed: A beneficial one due to longer sleep times during school closures and a detrimental one of psychological distress. This study investigated how sleep and health changed in the course of the pandemic when schools were open again. Overall, 12,238 adolescents in Switzerland participated in three cross-sectional online surveys: In 2017 under regular conditions (control group), during pandemic school closures in 2020 (closure group), and in 2021 still under pandemic conditions, but schools were open again (postclosure group). Sleep behavior and health-related characteristics (health-related quality of life;caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine use) in all three groups and depressive symptoms in the closure and postclosure groups were assessed. The sleep period on school days was longer in the closure group (median 9.00 h, interquartile range 8.25â€“9.75) and similar in the postclosure (7.92, 7.00â€“8.50) compared to the control group (7.75, 7.08â€“8.33). Health-related characteristics were better during school closures and similar to worse in the postclosure compared to the control group. Depressive symptom levels were higher in the postclosure than in the closure group. Therefore, beneficial effects were specific to school closures and adolescentsâ€™ psychological distress increased over the course of the pandemic.","Albrecht, J.

"Physiological and Psychological Relaxation Effects of Fir Essential Oil on University Students","Numerous studies have reported a significant increase in stress experienced by students owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, interest in stress management using nature-derived substances has increased. However, studies examining the effects of olfactory stimulation by fir are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological and psychological effects of inhaling fir essential oil. Additionally, differences between male and female participants were com-pared. Twenty-six university students (16 female and 10 male students;mean age, 21.5 Â± 1.9 years) participated in this study. Fir essential oil was used for olfactory stimulation, with normal room air as the control. The odor was administered for 3 min. Heart rate variability and heart rate were used as indicators of autonomic nervous system activity. The Profile of Mood States and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used as psychological indicators. The ln(Low Frequency/High Frequency) ratio, which is an indicator of sympathetic nervous activity reflecting a stressful or aroused state during stimulation with fir essential oil, was significantly lower than during the control condition. Assessment of psychological indicators showed that the positive mood of â€œvigorâ€ improved significantly and negative moods of â€œtensionâ€“anxietyâ€, â€œdepressionâ€, â€œangerâ€“hostilityâ€, â€œfatigueâ€ and anxiety levels reduced significantly after inhaling fir essential oil compared to the control condition. This study showed that inhalation of fir essential oil has physiologically and psychologically relaxing effects, with differences in results depending on the sex of the participants.","Kim, C.; Song, C.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095063","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31294,""
"Shared Virtual Reality Experiences during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Gratifications and Effects of Engagement with Immersive Videos","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and recent economic recession have been impacting many peopleâ€™s mental health. The experience of social distancing created new hardships for people who already reported symptoms of depression or anxiety. In these circumstances, new technologies, such as immersive virtual reality (VR) videos, could serve as useful tools for facilitating interac-tions, emotional sharing, and information processing within a virtual environment. In this study, researchers aimed to enrich the information processing literature by focusing on the uses and gratifications of 360-degree VR videos during the pandemic. Through employing survey research with 1422 participants located in the U.S. and structural equation modeling for data analysis, this study found that five types of gratification, including utilitarian (i.e., navigation), hedonic (i.e., enjoyment), sensual (i.e., realism), social (i.e., community), and symbolic (i.e., coolness), significantly motivated users to use such immersive videos. Simultaneously, data demonstrated that these five types of gratification could influence usersâ€™ cognitive engagement with virtual content. In addition, such VR engagement facilitated usersâ€™ positive attitudes toward immersive videos and continued usage of them. The findings provided practical implications for COVID-19 global recovery as well.","Cheng, Y.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, W.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095056","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31295,""
"Pancarditis as the Clinical Presentation of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: A Multimodality Approach to Diagnosis","Eosinophilic pancarditis (EP) is a rare, often unrecognized condition caused by endomyocardial infiltration of eosinophil granulocytes (referred as eosinophilic myocarditis, EM) associated with pericardial involvement. EM has a variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic cases to acute cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support (MCS) or chronic restrictive cardiomyopathy at high risk of progression to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). EP is associated with high in-hospital mortality, particularly when associated to endomyocardial thrombosis, coronary arteries vasculitis or severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. To date, there is a lack of consensus about the optimal diagnostic algorithm and clinical management of patients with biopsy-proven EP. The differential diagnosis includes hypersensitivity myocarditis, eosinophil granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), hypereosinophilic syndrome, parasitic infections, pregnancy-related hypereosinophilia, malignancies, drug overdose (particularly clozapine) and Omenn syndrome (OMIM 603554). To our knowledge, we report the first case of pancarditis associated to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) with negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Treatment with steroids and azathioprine was promptly started. Six months later, the patient developed a relapse: treatment with subcutaneous mepolizumab was added on the top of standard therapy, with prompt disease activity remission. This case highlights the role of a multimodality approach for the diagnosis of cardiac involvement associated to systemic immune disorders.","Lioncino, M.; Monda, E.; Dellegrottaglie, S.; Cirillo, A.; Caiazza, M.; Fusco, A.; Esposito, F.; Verrillo, F.; Ciccarelli, G.; Rubino, M.; Triggiani, M.; Scarpa, R.; Caforio, A.

"Hope and depression in Brazilian head and neck cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Head and neck cancer is characterised as traumatic, when compared to other types of cancer, due to the physical, physiological and social impact it has on the patient. Objective: To evaluate hope and severe depression in patients with head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Quantitative, observational, and analytical;conducted in the outpatient department of the head and neck department of an ontological hospital in the city of Curitiba, Parana, Brazil, with 60 patients with head and neck cancer being treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Data collection took place between May and September 2020, with the application of three questionnaires: socio-demographic and clinical;Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), to evaluate severe depression;and the Herth hope scale. Data analysis was through descriptive statistics and non-parametric Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests. Results: The age of participants ranged from 34 to 85 years, with 61.7% being male. The diagnosis of cancer occurred in the oral cavity (53.3%) and larynx (33.3%);28.3% (n = 17) presented with a diagnosis of depression;8.6% (n = 5) are in treatment with psychology;and 10.3% (n = 6) are in treatment with psychotropic drugs. The analysis of the association of the PHQ-9 score with sex showed a mean score of 7.7 +/- 6.2, with a higher level of depression in women. The mean hope score was 41.3 +/- 3.1;however, during the pandemic, 35% (n = 21) reported feelings of anguish, anxiety and fear, with the latter being predominant and in association with the PHQ-9 score showing a mean of 8.2 +/- 6.2 (p = 0.123). The association of hope with the number of children was statistically significant (p = 0.034) and in the education variable with the PHQ-9 score (p = 0.019).

"Evaluation of perceived stress and coronavirus-specific anxiety among hospitalized COVID-19 patients - A cross-sectional study","Background: COVID-19 pandemic enmeshed all people across the globe in myriad of problems and adversely affected their physical and mental health. Among all, patients who had been infected with COVID-19 might be at higher risk of psychological distress for obvious reasons. Aims and Objectives: The aim of the study was to find out the prevalence and level of perceived stress and coronavirus-specific anxiety in patients affected by COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on in-patients of a COVID-19 designated hospital who were about to get discharged. After screening the eligible patients with GHQ-12, patients who gave consent were interviewed with perceived stress scale (PSS)-4 and coronavirus anxiety scale. Results: Mean age of the study population was 41 years and majority (54.4%) belonged to 40-60 years of age. Slight preponderance of females (54.1%) noted and17.4% lost their source of income and encountered acute financial crisis. Mean duration of stay in the hospital was 10.2 (Â±4.4) days. Mean perceived stress and coronavirus-specific anxiety were 9.6 (Â±2.2) and 10.39 (Â±3.1), respectively. Loss of a family member due to COVID-19 infection, active COVID-19 infection in any family member, poor social support, and financial crisis were the factors correlated with higher PSS scores. Conclusion: Psychosocial factors contributed significantly for the higher level of perceived stress in COVID-19 patients in our study.

"Prevalence of stress, burnout, and job satisfaction among mental healthcare professionals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Objective To assess the levels of stress, burnout, and job satisfaction among mental healthcare professionals in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on mental healthcare professionals in Jeddah between January 2017 and October 2018. Sociodemographic characteristics and levels of stress, burnout, and job satisfaction were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and Job Satisfaction Scale (JSS). Descriptive statistics were used. Independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to assess for effects of demographic variables on the perceived stress score, emotional exhaustion (EE) score, depersonalization (DP) score, professional accomplishment (PA) score, and the job satisfaction score (JSS). Results A total of 107 participants were included (50.5% men;49.5% women) with response rate of 79.2%. Prevalence of stress was 56.1%. High levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were present among 41 (38.3%) and 26 (24.3%) of the respondents, respectively, while high score of low personal accomplishment were present among 61 (57%) respondents. In terms of job satisfaction, 25 (23.4%) were satisfied and 74 (69.2%) were indecisive. Male participantsâ€™ emotional exhaustion score (27Â±12) was significantly higher than females (22 Â±10), (t(105) = 1.99, p-value = 0.049). Also, participants with a monthly income above SR 20,000 had significantly higher total job satisfaction (p-value = 0.041). Conclusions Our findings suggest rates of stress and burnout among mental health professionals that warrant attention, with less than one-quarter of the participants being satisfied with their jobs. Further studies are needed to expand the findings and to explore the contributing factors. Additionally, interventions should be established by authorities to address the increasing rates of stress and burnout.","Alqarni, Turki, Alghamdi, Abdulrahman, Alzahrani, Alhussain, Abumelha, Khalid, Alqurashi, Zahid, Alsaleh, Ahmad","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267578","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(4), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31299,""
"Antenatal screening of depressive and manic symptoms in south Brazilian childbearing women: a transversal study in advance of the pandemic scenario","Background: The diagnosis of mood disorders (MD) during pregnancy is challenging and may bring negative consequences to the maternal-fetal binomial. The long waitlist for specialized psychiatric evaluation in Brazil contributes to the treatment omission. Almost 20.0% of women treated with antidepressants have a positive screening for bipolar disorder. Therefore, it has been recommended the investigation of depressive and bipolar disorder during prenatal care. Unfortunately, the screening for mood disorders is not a reality in Brazil and many childbearing women remain undiagnosed. The objective of this study is to observe the frequency of MD and the effectiveness of screening scales for routine use by health professionals during prenatal care in high-risk pregnancies. Methodology/Principal: findings This cross-sectional study included 61 childbearing women in their second trimester who were interviewed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ). The cut-off point was EPDS 13 and MDQ 7 and the SCID-5 was the gold standard diagnosis. MD were diagnosed in 24.6% of the high-risk pregnancies. EDPS was positive in 19.7% and the frequency of major depression was 8.2%. 16.4% of the childbearing women were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, while MDQ was positive in 36.1%. 11.5% of the women had EPDS and MDQ positive. EPDS sensitivity was 80.0% and specificity 92.1%, whereas MDQ presented a sensitivity of 70.0% and specificity of 70.6%. Conclusion/Significance: There is a high prevalence of MD in high-risk pregnancies. The routine use of EPDS simultaneously to MDQ during antenatal care is effective and plays an important role in early diagnosis, counselling, and promotion of perinatal mental health.","Fraga, F.

"Mental Health Effects of COVID-19 Media Exposure Are Amplified in the United States Compared to Italy","Background: Prolonged media exposure is widely shown to have adverse effects on peopleâ€™s mental health. Do these effects show variation across different countries? In the present study, we compared the link between media exposure and mental health-related outcomes in the United States and Italy, two countries with high levels of early COVID-19 prevalence. Method: Participants matched on age and gender in the United States (n = 415) and Italy (n = 442) completed assessments of media exposure, stress, anxiety, COVID-19 worry, and other variables in August 2020. Results: Media exposure was strongly linked with stress, anxiety, and COVID-19 worry, net of the effects of neuroticism, political identification, and demographics. We also observed Country x Media exposure interactions in the prediction of stress and COVID-19 worry. Media exposure more strongly predicted stress and COVID-19 worry in the United States than Italy. Conclusions: Findings are among the first to document cross-national differences in the impact of media exposure.","Anthony Mancini et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0046-3F6-901","20220513","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology|Cross-cultural Psychology; cross-national; worry; italy; united states; covid-19; stress; media exposure","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31306,""
"Well-Being and COVID-19 Worry: Divergent Effects through Social Interaction and Depression in a Cross-National Study","Can worrying about COVID-19 have positive consequences for well-being? In a preregistered study, we examined the effect of worries about COVID-19 on well-being through divergent associations with social interaction and depression. In August 2020, participants from high and low prevalence regions in the United States and Italy (N = 857) completed assessments of COVID-19 worry, social interaction, depression, and well-being. Worries about COVID-19 predicted both more social interaction and more depression. In mediational analyses, an adaptive pathway of COVID-19 worry through social interaction was associated with higher well-being, whereas a maladaptive pathway through depression was associated with lower well-being. Further, a comparison of high and low COVID-19 prevalence regions replicated the mediational findings for social interaction, providing evidence against reverse causation and common method variance. Findings suggest that normative worries about acute stressors can both benefit and undermine well-being, depending on their impact on social behavior or depression.","Anthony Mancini et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0045-A17-C07","20220512","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology|Cross-cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; psychosocial gains from adversity; worry; social behavior; covid-19; depression; well-being","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31307,""
"â€œWeird dualityâ€: Learning from peer mentorsâ€™ experiences of supporting student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: To explore the experiences of university peer mentors in the pandemic context and apply participatory methods to co-produce recommendations for practice. Participants: Thirteen peer mentors from varied undergraduate and postgraduate mentoring programmes in one university in South-East England. Methods: A two-phase qualitative design involving individual interviews and a focus group, followed by a participatory action group with a subset of phase 1 participants. Results: Peer mentors identified an increasing student need for mental health support during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, engaging with prospective mentees was a challenging process for many participants. Peer mentors assumed multiple roles. Mentor-mentee relationship were characterised by intimacy and mutuality, which were seen as conducive to providing authentic support but also presented significant challenges in negotiating boundaries. Conclusions: Peer mentoring is a complex activity, characterised by a sense of multiplicity and mutuality. Peer mentors require greater supervision and training to manage these complexities.","Clio Berry et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E017D-5EB-21C","20220513","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mentoring; student support; mental health; peer support; higher education; university students; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","",31308,""
