"2019 Research Grant Does opioid tapering prior to spinal fusion improve surgical outcomes: a randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND CONTEXT Preoperative opioid use in spine patients is associated with adverse patient-reported outcomes, higher rates of perioperative complications, increased postoperative opioid dependence, and greater surgical costs. PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to determine whether a structured preoperative opioid tapering regimen can successfully reduce postoperative opioid use and improve outcomes in spinal fusion surgery. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Single center RCT. PATIENT SAMPLE To date, 12 patients enrolled (5 control, 7 taper). OUTCOME MEASURES Milligram morphine equivalent (MME) opioid use;back and leg numeric pain rating scale (NPRS);PROMIS (depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, satisfaction, physical function, pain interference, pain behavior);other medication use;intra- and perioperative outcomes;complications;subjective opiate withdrawal scale (SOWS). METHODS Patients undergoing thoracolumbar, lumbar, or lumbosacral spinal fusion surgery and taking opioids daily for 4 weeks prior to the preoperative planning visit were eligible for inclusion (buprenorphine and long-acting formulations excluded). Consenting patients were randomized to undergo a 4-week tapering program (reduction of 10% per week for a total of 40% prior to surgery) or to the control group. Patients were guided through the tapering process via weekly phone calls. Control patients also received weekly phone calls with the same outcomes administered, with the exception of the SOWS. All patients were followed postoperatively with weekly phone calls for 6 weeks, and via their 3- and 6-month postoperative visits. A preliminary analysis of the data to date was performed through data visualization and univariate statistics (a=0.5, SAS v9.4). RESULTS Initially, this study was powered conservatively for 78 patients. The COVID pandemic resulted in significant study disruptions and enrollment challenges. Patients, many of whom are seeking surgery for poorly controlled pain, were wary of tapering their opiate use, with the top reasons for study refusal including: (1) pain not well controlled, unwilling to risk randomization, (2) pain well controlled, unwilling to risk randomization, (3) Insufficient time, (4) no response after initial contact, and (5) unresponsive to any contact. For the 12 patients enrolled to date [50% female, median age 68 (range 49â€“74)]. The breakdown of opioids taken was: hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 (41%), oxycodone/acetaminophen 3 (25%), tramadol 3 (25%), and oxycodone 1 (8%). All but 2 (16%) of patients used additional pain medications, most commonly acetaminophen (50%) and gabapentin (42%). The median number of levels fused in both groups was 5 (range control: 2-5, range experimental: 2-11). There were no obvious differences in baseline demographics, surgical approach, or analgesia. Total in-hospital MME was a median of 365 (IQR 143-395) for the control group and 295 (IQR: 189-322) for the taper group (pÂ =Â 0.625). Three (60%) of the control group and 1 (15%) of the taper group required a pain consult (pÂ =Â 0.222). None of the control group and 4 (57%) of the taper group had perioperative complications (pÂ =Â 0.081). Control and taper patients had similar baseline NPRS pain;however, the taper group had lower back pain during the taper period (median back pain 1.5 to 6 points lower;p &lt;0.05 for taper weeks 1 & 3;p &lt;0.10 for taper weeks 2 and 4). Postoperative pain did not differ between groups. Visually, trends in leg pain were similar, but the variability was larger. No differences were evident in the PROMIS CATs between groups. During the taper period, none of the tapering patients experienced more than mild withdrawal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Patients are hesitant to participate in preoperative opiate tapering, and the COVID epidemic further exacerbated these anxieties. In those patients who did taper, there is some evidence towards reduced preoperative pain and potentially lower in-hospital MMEs. To date, no differences are evident in postoperative PROMs. Enrollment of additional patients is ongoing, as is the analysis of pre- and postoperative MMEs.

"Resiliencia en las personas mayores durante la primera ola pandÃ©mica de la COVID-19 en Chile: una perspectiva desde los determinantes sociales de la salud","Resumen Objetivo: Evaluar la asociaciÃ³n entre los determinantes sociales de la salud (DSS) y la resiliencia en las personas mayores durante el primer periodo de confinamiento en la pandemia COVID-19 en Chile. MÃ©todos: Se realizÃ³ un estudio observacional con diseÃ±o transversal utilizando los datos de una encuesta representativa a nivel nacional. En dicha encuesta, mediante un proceso de aleatorizaciÃ³n sistemÃ¡tica, una submuestra de personas con edad = 60 aÃ±os de la comunidad fueron entrevistadas telefÃ³nicamente durante la primera ola pandÃ©mica de la COVID-19 en Chile. La resiliencia se evaluÃ³ utilizando la Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) y los sÃ­ntomas depresivos con el Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Los DSS considerados fueron: edad, gÃ©nero, nivel educacional, condiciÃ³n laboral, aislamiento social, soledad, insatisfacciÃ³n de necesidades de vivienda y de atenciÃ³n en salud. Resultados: Se obtuvo una muestra total de 582 personas. La edad promedio fue de 71 aÃ±os (DT=7.64;69% mujeres). Se obtuvo una asociaciÃ³n significativa entre una baja resiliencia y las siguientes condiciones: alta soledad (<U+200B><U+200B>OR: 1.776 [IC 95%: 1.146-2.751], alto riesgo de aislamiento social (OR: 1.667 [IC 95% 1.149-2.419]) y sÃ­ntomas depresivos (OR: 2.602 [IC 95% 1.795-3.774]). El gÃ©nero femenino fue un factor protector (OR: 0.589 [IC 95%: 0.406-0.855]). ConclusiÃ³n: Los DSS como la alta soledad y el aislamiento social son factores que se asocian con una baja resiliencia de las personas mayores durante la pandemia de la COVID-19, por lo que se deben tener en cuenta al momento de planificar estrategias de intervenciÃ³n en la salud pÃºblica. Objective: To assess the association between social determinants of health (SDH) and resilience in older people during the first period of confinement in the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. Materials and methods: An observational study with a cross-sectional design was conducted using a nationally representative survey data-set. In this survey, using a systematic randomization process, a subsample of people aged = 60 years from the community were interviewed by telephone during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. Resilience was assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale. The SDH considered were: age, sex, educational level, employment status, social isolation, loneliness, discontent with housing and health care needs. Results: A total sample of 582 persons was obtained. The mean age was 71 years (SD=7.64;69% women). A significant association was obtained between low resilience and the following conditions: loneliness (OR: 1.776 [95% CI: 1.146-2.751]), high risk of social isolation (OR: 1.667 [95% CI 1.149-2.419]), and depressive symptoms (OR: 2602 [95% CI 1795-3774]). Female gender was a protective factor (OR: 0.589 [95% CI: 0.406-0.855]). Conclusion: The SDH, such as loneliness and social isolation, are factors associated with low resilience in older people during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be taken into account in planning public health intervention strategies.","Oppenheimer-Lewin, Dafna, Ortega-Palavecinos, Maritza, NÃºÃ±ez-CortÃ©s, Rodrigo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2022.08.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista EspaÃ±ola de GeriatrÃ­a y GerontologÃ­a;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36979,""
"Trends in Negative Emotions Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","Objectives To identify trends in the prevalence of negative emotions in the United States throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, between March 2020 and November 2021. Study design Descriptive, repeated cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative survey data. Methods Data originated from Gallupâ€™s COVID-19 web survey, encompassing 156,684 observations. Prevalence estimates for self-reported prior-day experience of sadness, worry, stress, anger, loneliness, depression, and anxiety were computed, plotted using descriptive trend graphs, and compared to 2019 estimates from the Gallup World Poll. Differences between estimates were evaluated by inspecting confidence intervals. Results Stress and worry were the most commonly experienced negative emotions between March 2020 and November 2021;worry and anger were significantly more prevalent than pre-pandemic. The prevalence of sadness, worry, stress, and anger fluctuated considerably over time and declined steadily to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2021. Distinctive spikes in the prevalence of several negative emotions, especially sadness and anger, were observed following the murder of George Floyd. Conclusions Several negative emotions exhibited excess prevalence during the pandemic, especially in spring/summer 2020. Despite recent reductions to pre-pandemic levels, continued monitoring is necessary to inform policies and interventions to promote population well-being.","Hagen, Daniel, Lai, Alden Yuanhong, Goldmann, Emily","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.08.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36980,""
"Delayed Onset Catatonia after COVID-19","COVID-19 has many complications that are associated with this infection. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and can present with symptoms documented both during acute COVID-19 infection and developing after the resolution of respiratory symptoms. Patients have presented with a variety of symptoms such as anosmia, seizures, cognitive and attention deficits, new or progression of existing anxiety, depression, psychosis, and rarely catatonia. Although rare, catatonia and each of its subtypes have now been reported as complications of COVID-19 and therefore, should be considered known to occur in both during the acute and postinfectious states. Diagnosis of catatonia in the context of COVID-19 should be considered when work-up for more common medical causes of encephalopathy are negative. There have been cases documented in the literature of patients presenting to the hospital with catatonia during COVID-19 infection. However, we present a case of akinetic catatonia in setting of COVID-19 infection and premorbid serious mental illness that was diagnosed and treated on an outpatient basis with close collaboration between primary care and psychiatry.","Bajwa, Jasdeep Singh, Fu, Annabel, Mirabelli, Mark H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycr.2022.100043","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Case Reports;: 100043, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36981,""
"Psychiatric Symptoms in COVID-19-positive Individuals in the General Population: Trajectories of Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia","The present study investigates differences in the trajectories of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems among infected versus non-infected case-controlled individuals. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were selected from a representative sample in Norway (N &gt; 10,000). In total, 126 of these individuals were infected during the project period, and this group was analyzed at T5 (May 2021). Of these positive cases, those who had completed both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 at all three measurement points were selected for longitudinal analysis using multilevel modeling. There was a significant difference at T5 between those who had tested positive for COVID-19 and matched controls. Anxiety and depression were reduced among those who tested positive, but there were no differences in trajectory when compared to matched controls. Limitations include the use of self-report measures and the assessment of symptoms at a time when strict virus mitigation protocols were in place. The present findings indicate that individuals who test positive for COVID-19 exhibit higher levels of depressive symptoms after restrictions are lifted. However, comparison of anxiety and depression symptom trajectories with matched controls reveals that both groups exhibited stable or slightly decreased symptoms.","Johnson, Sverre Urnes, Amundsen, Ole Myklebust, Johnson, Miriam Sinkerud, Hoffart, Asle, HalsÃ¸y, Ã˜yvind, Skjerdingstad, Nora, Ebling, Sara, Ebrahimi, Omid V.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114806","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114806, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36982,""
"Emotional eating and depression during the pandemic: QuarantEat, an Italian nationwide survey","Objective : This study aimed to explore the consequences of the lockdown among the Italian general population by focusing on depression and emotional overeating (EO). Research Methods & Procedures: QuarantEat was an Italian nationwide cross-sectional study conducted using a Computer-Assisted Web Interview method (6th-31st May 2020). The 40-item questionnaire included the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index and the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire-5. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed. Results : A total of 1865 adults participated. Depression and EO were reported by 57.6% and 49.3% of the sample, respectively. Considering multivariable models, females, students, participants who smoked more/equal during lockdown and individuals with EO were more likely to report depression. Following a healthier diet or exercising during lockdown reduced the probability of depression. The likelihood of EO was higher for participants who were female, consumed more food, had a less healthy diet, were overweight and obese, consumed more chocolate, consumed more snacks between meals or before going to sleep/during the night, and were at risk for depression. Increasing age, having a relationship, and not having increased TV/computer watching time while eating reduced the odds of EO. Conclusions : QuarantEat highlighted high levels of depression and EO right after the end of lockdown measures. It also outlined the importance of the relationships between mental health and health risk behaviors, such as smoking, exercise, diet, and changes in eating behaviors due to lockdown. It is essential to plan interventions using a holistic approach and reach every individual overcoming the limits caused by the restrictive measures.","Moro, Giuseppina Lo, Bert, Fabrizio, Catozzi, Dario, Scacchi, Alessandro, Siliquini, Roberta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2022.111825","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nutrition;: 111825, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36983,""
"Global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health services: A systematic review","The purpose of the review was to investigate the changes in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies was conducted from February 2021 to March 2022 using four databases and five languages. 29 studies reporting on mental health services in 63 countries were included. Findings were organised according to nine major topics: (1) lack of preparedness vs. timely response and flexible solutions, (2) changes in access, referrals, and admission, (3) impacts on outpatient, community and psychosocial services, (4) inpatient: reorganisation of hospital psychiatric units/acute wards, (5) diagnostic and therapeutic adaptations, (6) effects on medication, (7) infection control measures, (8), changes in patientsâ€™ demands, engagement, and mental health, and (9) impacts on staff and team. Many services were closed intermittently or considerably reduced while telepsychiatric services were extensively expanded. Face-to-face services decreased, as did the work with therapeutic groups. Many inpatient units restructured their services to accommodate COVID-19 patients. While the digitalisation of services allowed for better access to services for some, restrictive measures hindered access for most. Staff experienced changes such as heightened impacts on their own mental health, burdens on patients and the pausing of professional training. Clearly, diverse findings of studies relate to different (national) contexts, type of service offered, but also to the time of the investigation, as studies noted several distinct phases of change during the pandemic. This review suggests directions for policy and service development, such as fostering community services and providing support services for particularly vulnerable populations.","Duden, Gesa Solveig, Gersdorf, Stefanie, Stengler, Katarina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.08.013","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36984,""
"How can machine learning be used in stress management: A systematic literature review of applications in workplaces and education","In today's competitive and rival world, stress has emerged to be an integral part of every person's life which affects an individual directly or indirectly in many ways. The COVID-19 pandemic even glorified the importance and cruciality of managing stress, anxiety and depression as these created a massive impact on the economy, education, healthcare, business areas and other aspects of society in every possible manner. This study determines to find all the feasible contributing factors to stress, anxiety and depression which influence individuals coming from vivid occupational backgrounds due to personal, work-related, psychological and interpersonal reasons. Our research aims to define and describe the impact of the rise in technology and the COVID-19 pandemic on the stress levels of an individual. It includes variously supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in detecting stress efficiently and effectively among a huge population. The objective of this paper is to make those millions of people aware of the early detection and treatment of stress before it becomes life-threatening to them. The paper finally throws light on how stress-related research will help policymakers in the education field and general industry sector to rebuild the policies on stress and countermeasures to avoid stress.","Mittal, Shivani, Mahendra, Sumedha, Sanap, Viraj, Churi, Prathamesh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjimei.2022.100110","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Information Management Data Insights; 2(2):100110, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36985,""
"Anaesthetic management of a parturient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome","Introduction: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital vascular disease which is characterised by capillary, venous and lymphatic malformations. We describe the anaesthetic management of a 36 year old parturient with COVID-19 and KTS, who underwent an elective caesarean section. Very few such cases have been described and the multi-system nature of condition poses various challenges to both the obstetrician and the anaesthetist. Case Report: We had a 36-year-old woman who had experienced three previous normal vaginal deliveries and an elective caesarean section (CS) four years previously under general anaesthetic(GA) at 36 weeks gestation. She was told by a vascular surgeon that she was not suitable for regional anaesthesia. There was no recent imaging of her back to rule out arteriovenous(AV) malformations. Her past history included gastric bypass surgery under GA two years ago. She also had depression, varicose veins and three previous deep venous thrombosis andwas on prophylactic lowmolecularweight heparin. She had tested positive for COVID-19 4 days previously, and had mild symptoms of cough and sore throat. After a multi-disciplinary discussion involving an obstetrician, vascular surgeon, haematologist and anaesthetist, a decision was made to proceed with GA despite recent COVID-19, because of the possibility of AV malformations, in agreement with the patient. After securing two wide bore cannulae and adequate preoxygenation, a modified Rapid Sequence Induction was performed, and a tracheal tube was secured. Anaesthesia was maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. After delivery of the baby, oxytocin 5U, followed by an infusion, midazolam, morphine, ondansetron and dexamethasone were administered. Extubation was performed when the patient was fully awake. In recovery, further opioids were given for pain. There were no concerns for the newborn. Estimated blood loss was 200 mL. Discussion: Gestation and its physiology may further exacerbate the manifestations of KTS, with increased obstetric risk. The success in the management of these patients requires the participation of a multidisciplinary team, consisting of obstetrician, anaesthetist, urologist, haematologist and vascular surgeon, with appropriate collaboration among the professionals involved. Periodic imaging and clotting tests are recommended to evaluate the evolution of vascular malformations in the pelvis, uterus and vagina, and identify neuraxial changes, to guide the safest way of delivery and anaesthesia.","Palit, D.; Al Janabi, B.; Doraiswami, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2022.103496","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia; 50:103, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36986,""
"Mental well-being of ICU nurses after the second surge of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study","Objectives To determine the impact of the second surge of the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2020 to June 2021) on mental well-being of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and factors associated with mental health outcomes. Methods An online survey was available for Dutch ICU nurses in October 2021, measuring mental health symptoms;anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and post-traumatic stress disorder (Impact of Event Scale-6). Additionally, work-related fatigue was measured using the Need For Recovery-11 questionnaire. Previous data from the first surge (March until June 2020) were used to study mental well-being longitudinally in a subgroup of ICU nurses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with mental health symptoms. Results In total, 589 ICU nurses (mean age 44.8 [SD, 11.9], 430 [73.8%] females) participated, of whom 164 also completed the questionnaire in 2020. After the second surge, 225/589 (38.2%) ICU nurses experienced one or more mental health symptoms and 294/589 (49.9%) experienced work-related fatigue. Compared to the first measurement, the occurrence of mental health symptoms remained high (55/164 [33.5%] vs. 63/164 [38.4%], p=0.36) and work-related fatigue was significantly higher (66/164 [40.2%] vs. 83/164 [50.6%], p=0.02). Granted holidays as requested (aOR, 0.54;95% CI, 0.37-0.79), being more confident about the future (aOR, 0.59;95% CI, 0.37-0.93) and a better perceived work-life balance (aOR, 0.42;95% CI, 0.27-0.65) were significantly associated with less symptoms. Conclusion The second surge of the COVID-19 pandemic further drained the mental reserves of ICU nurses, resulting in more work-related fatigue.","Heesakkers, Hidde, Zegers, Marieke, van Mol, Margo M.

"Family caregiversâ€™ responses to a visitation restriction policy at a Korean surgical intensive care unit before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","Background Since the COVID-19 pandemic, restricting family visits in the ICU has increased concerns regarding negative psychosocial consequences to patients and families. Objectives To compare the quality of life, depressive symptoms, and emotions in family caregivers of ICU patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore familiesâ€™ perceptions and suggestions for the visitation. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted in 99 family caregivers of adult surgical ICU patients from an urban academic medical center in South Korea (February to July 2021). The WHO's Quality of Life-BREF, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression, and Visual Analogue Scale were used to assess quality of life, depressive symptoms, and emotions, respectively. The Family Perception Checklist was used to assess familiesâ€™ perceptions and suggestions about the visitation restriction. Results were compared with the data from our previous survey (n=187) in 2017. Results Family caregivers were mostly women (n=59), adult children (n=43) or spouse (n=38) of patients with mean age of 47.34 years. Family caregivers surveyed during the pandemic reported worsening sadness (54.66 Â± 28.93, 45.58 Â± 29.44, P=0.005) and anxiety (53.86 Â± 30.07, 43.22 Â± 29.02, P=0.001) than those who were surveyed in. While majority of families were satisfied with the visitation restrictions (86.9%), only 50.5% were satisfied with the amount of information provided on the patient's condition. Conclusions Visitation restriction is necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic despite sadness and anxiety reported in caregivers. Hence, alternative visitation strategies are needed to mitigate psychological distress and provide sufficient information to ICU family caregivers.","Suh, Jiwoo, Na, Sungwon, Jung, Seungho, Kim, Kwan Hyung, Choo, Sungji, Choi, JiYeon, Kim, Jeongmin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2022.08.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heart & Lung;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36988,""
"Understanding the mental health impacts of poor quality private-rented housing during the UK's first COVID-19 lockdown","This paper examines the mental health impacts of poor quality private-rented housing in the north of England during the UK's first COVID-19 lockdown. The paper draws on data collected from semi-structured telephone interviews with 40 renters in the private-rented sector. We use the Power Threat Meaning Framework to highlight how substandard housing was a social and material vulnerability which, underpinned by powerlessness, resulted in threats that created and exacerbated the mental-ill health of precarious private renters.

Our aim was to carry out a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of mental health symptoms in HCWs in Colombia. Methods : A cross-sectional web-survey study was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic mid-2021 including HCWs in two hospitals in Colombia. The PCL-5, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scales were used to assess the prevalence of symptoms and severity of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in Colombia. Results : From 257 surveyed respondents, 44.36% were nurses, 36.58% physicians and 19.07% other health professionals. The prevalence of PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms were 18.68%, 43.19%, and 26.85%, amongst HCWs. The regression model evidence a strong risk of PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms in HCWs in Colombia during the second wave of COVID-19 in the middle of 2021. Conclusions : The prevalence for several mental health symptoms in HCWs in Colombia were higher compared with the general population. HCWs are at-risk population to develop chronic symptoms and mental disorders during and after outbreaks. These results will be helpful to tailor strategies to support the physical and mental health of the HCWs in LMICs.","Guillen-Burgos, Hernan Felipe, Gomez-Ureche, Janitza, Acosta, Nahir, Acevedo-Vergara, Kaleb, Perez-Florez, Manuel, Villalba, Elizabeth, Maloof, Dieb, Dau, Alberto, Salva, Silvia, Mattar, Salvador, Escaf, Jorge, Perez, Abdel, Parra-Saavedra, Miguel, Medina, Patricia, Torres, Jose, Mesino, Cesar, Torrenegra, Riguey, Tapia, Jesus, Salcedo, Soraya, Maestre, Ronald, Galvez-Florez, Juan Francisco","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2022.100293","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Trauma & Dissociation;: 100293, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36990,""
"Mortality by Cause of Death during Year 1 of the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Cohort of Older Adults from Baltimore Maryland who Have Injected Drugs","Background . In 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose deaths increased. However, no studies have characterized changes in mortality during the pandemic in a well-characterized cohort of people who use drugs in active follow-up at the time of pandemic onset. Design . We compared all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the first year of the pandemic (Mar â€“ Dec 2020) to the five years preceding (Jan 2015 â€“ Feb 2020), among participants in the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) study: a community-recruited cohort of adults from Baltimore who have injected drugs. 3,510 participants contributed 17,498 person-years [py] of follow-up time. Cause and dates of death were ascertained through the National Death Index. Comparisons were made for the full cohort and within subgroups with potentially differential levels of vulnerability. Results . All-cause mortality in 2020 was 39.6 per 1,000 py, as compared to 37.2 per 1,000 py pre- pandemic (Adjusted Incidence Rate RatioÂ =Â 1.09, 95%: confidence interval: 0.84-1.41). Increases were mostly attributable to chronic disease deaths;injury/poisoning deaths did not increase. No pre-post differences were statistically significant. Conclusion . In this exploratory analysis of an older cohort of urban-dwelling adults who have injected drugs, mortality changes during the first year of the pandemic differed from national trends and varied across potentially vulnerable subgroups. More research is needed to understand determinants of increased risk of mortality during the pandemic among subgroups of people who use drugs.","Feder, Kenneth A.; Sun, Jing, Rudolph, Jacqueline E.; Cepeda, Javier, Astemborski, Jacquie, Baker, Pieter A.; Pigott, Damani A.; Kirk, Gregory D.; Mehta, Shruti H.; Genberg, Becky L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103842","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103842, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36991,""
"Factors associated with COVID-19 fear among healthcare professionals in Bangladesh","To determine the factors associated with the COVID-19 fear, we conducted an online survey among healthcare professionals in Bangladesh. The â€œfear of COVID-19 scaleâ€ was used to measure the fear. The predicting factors were identified by deploying a multiple linear regression model. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the relationship between mental health symptoms and COVID-19 fear. The overall fear score was 19.39Â Â±Â 5.26 (MÂ Â±Â SD) out of 28. Multiple linear regression identified financial constraints, self-employment, and general duties as the independent predictors of COVID-19 fear. However, structural equation modelling found a strong positive relationship between anxiety, insomnia, and fear. Results might be helpful for the policymakers and mental healthcare professionals to identify and manage maladaptive levels of fear and worry because of the coronavirus outbreak.","Ali, Mohammad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dialog.2022.100037","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Dialogues in Health;: 100037, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36992,""
"Digital aging and mental health deteriorations: Risk mitigation in the older people with liver disease in Indonesia","Objectives: Indonesia is entering an aging society with an older people population reaching 26.82 million people or 9.92% of the total population in 2020 and it is predicted that around one-fifth of Indonesia's population in 2045 will be older people. The senior citizen is the covid-19 most at risk due to comorbidities and low digital literacy. In Indonesia, the liver is one of the highest comorbid factors in increasing the risk of death by 13.5 times and increasing to 16.8 times in the elderly due to COVID-19. This condition increases the aging market in Indonesia but low digital literacy will affect the lower QoL. Materials and Methods: Using data from the 2014 Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), this study aims to analyze mental health problems and mobile phone ownership in older adults (60) with Liver disease. Results: The analysis shows that the proportion of older people with liver disease reaches 4,07% and 59,18% are male. 57,5% of them experienced mental health problems and the percentage is higher in men. However, the percentage of elderly with liver disease experiencing mental health problems will decrease by 6,78% when they have a cellphone. The elderly SES in Indonesia has a fairly diverse distribution between provinces and 55,8% of them are still working. Nearly half of older people's education attainment is elementary school, which reaches 46.05 percent. In general, the elderly with higher digital literacy prefer to seek treatment at a formal health facility than traditional practitioners such as shamans. They tend to seek outpatient care treatment at a community health center or Puskesmas (44,11%), specialist (29,41%), and private hospital (11,76%). Conclusion: Increasing digital aging encourages elderly health literacy, as well as decreases mental health problems. Mainstreaming the digital aging issue can help various information and services needed by the elderly to be healthier, independent, and with dignity.","Purba, R. H.

"CURRENT GAPS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: INTERVIEWS WITH PHYSICIANS ACROSS VARIOUS MEDICAL SPECIALTIES","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brought unforeseen challenges and had many unfortunate consequences. The unprecedented uncertainty and other drastic changes that were driven by the pandemic illuminated some of the existing flaws in our healthcare system and in medical education. Numerous articles have been published discussing the impact of COVID-19;however, relatively few focus on its relation to medical education, specifically regarding communication, health equity, and uncertainty in medicine. We aim to explore these challenges as opportunities to guide improvements in medical education curriculum in these areas. METHODS: Physicians across Colorado from various medical specialties and unique practice environments were interviewed. We developed a standard set of interview questions that focused on the impact of the pandemic in the context of physicians' practices, the effect on patient care, adaptations, and the impact on trainees' education. Audio files of the interviews were transcribed, analyzed, and tallied according to a list of systematically established themes. The final data was reviewed to identify common and critical themes that could be used as an opportunity to create a positive transformation to medical education. RESULTS: Thirty-one physicians across 20 different medical specialties and sub-specialties were interviewed within the month of April 2020. Analysis of the interviews identified a number of common themes including significant mental health impact, a lack of data to drive clinical decisions, challenges in communication with patients and their families, and a disproportionate impact of the pandemic on underserved communities. Next steps include the administration and analysis of a follow-up survey of proposed innovative solutions for all interviewed physicians. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic illuminated gaps in our healthcare system that were already present but not readily apparent. These identified themes impact all specialties, demonstrating that many of these gaps are universal in the field of medicine, and we believe that the best way to effect change is to incorporate these topics into medical education. Challenging trainees to navigate complex cases that may lack absolute answers would emphasize critical thinking and better prepare physicians for the uncertainties and complexities of medicine. As telehealth has transformed healthcare delivery, students must learn to navigate the nuances of virtual care without sacrificing the quality of care. Also, the increased prevalence of anxiety has highlighted the importance of being adequately trained to identify and address mental health disorders regardless of medical specialty. Lastly, the pandemic's disproportionate impact on underserved populations emphasizes the importance for students to be well-versed on topics such as health equity, policy reform and advocacy, and economics in ways that allow for actionable change.","Yu, S.; Kim, E.; Little, C.; Tompkins, A.

"Self-Management of Fear due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Changes it has brought to the Every Day Life","Introduction: The recent pandemic of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, has had financial and social repercussions apart from its consequences to the physical and mental health of humans. Aim: The aim of this work was to study the way of the self-management of stress and fear which has been caused by the pandemic crisis, as well as the impact of the pandemic on daily living. More specifically, the factors which influenced the management of the symptoms of fear, either in a positive or in a negative way, were studied, and also the ways individuals and their families use to manage fear. Method: The method which was used was the case study of an adult female who lives and works in a Greek town, during the third curfew, in March 2021. The tool which was used for data collection was the semistructured interview, by utilizing a questionnaire consisting of 10 open-ended questions. Before the start of the interview, a signed informed consent form was obtained. The questions were divided into three topic areas, with the first concerning the demonstration of stress before the pandemic broke out, the second concerning the fear during the pandemic, and the third dealing with the ways of managing fear, the availability of persons capable of helping, as well as the kind of help she could have sought to cope with this situation. Results: The results of this study showed the impact of the curfew restrictions for the management of the pandemic on the daily lives of the people who experience them. Before the start of the pandemic, stress was primarily related to work and to the need of maintaining a routine. Public fear intensified during the pandemic and the lockdown, both in relation to work and in relation to the pandemic itself, and also in relation to its effects on work and social life, and certainly on physical and mental health. Her stress affected the rest of her family members;however, her social network proved to be a significant support. Conclusions: Stress and fear increased during the pandemic and the lockdown which was imposed in Greece in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This stress, which prior to the pandemic was focused mainly on work-related issues, spread to other areas of daily life, a fact that affected all the family members. Discussions and support from the husband, and also from the wider circle of family and friends, helped deal with and manage the situation which was caused by the pandemic, due to the special living conditions which were in force.","Vlachou, C.; Argyriadis, A.; Argyriadi, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Self-Management+of+Fear+due+to+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+and+the+Changes+it+has+brought+to+the+Every+Day+Life","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Review of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics, International Edition; 36(1):17-22, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36995,""
"Immediate Psychological Impact of COVID 19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Pediatric Healthcare Workers","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has been effecting the world since December, 2019. Front line healthcare professionals faced increased stress level while dealing with overload of patients. Hence it triggered feelings of loneliness, despair and physical mental fatigue. Objective: To determine the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of pediatric healthcare workers by using Depression Anxiety Stress scoring scale, DASS-21 scale. Methods: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 1st July to 30th November 2020 in the department of Pediatric Medicine Unit II, King Edward Medical University/Mayo Hospital, Lahore. A 21 -item Depression Anxiety Stress scoring scale was circulated online among Healthcare workers of Teaching hospitals of Lahore. These included Pediatric Specialists, General Physicians, Postgraduate Trainees in Paeds Medicine, House Officers in Paeds Medicine and Pediatric Nurses. 150 Healthcare workers (HCWs) participated. Responses were analyzc.d with SPSS V26 Results: Out of 150 healthcare workers, 101(67.3%) were falling in the range of 20-30 years, 76(50.7 females, 81(54%) were singles, maximum 59(39.3%) were postgraduate trainees and majority 65(43.4%) had &lt;2 years working experience.

"EXPERIENCES OF PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS DURING AND AFTER COVID-19 INDUCED QUARANTINE IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH STATUS: A QUALITATIVE STUDY","The aim of this study was to explore experiences of people with rheumatoid arthritis during and after COVID-19 induced quarantine in terms of physical activity and health status. Rheumatoid arthritis affects multiple facets of the person, both physically and psychologically. Physical activity is considered a safe and effective intervention to improve symptoms and systemic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis. In the context of the COVID-19 countries like Spain were forced to impose restrictions on mobility, prohibiting outings even to perform physical activity. Structured interviews were conducted and developed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia -11 questionnaire. Data were analysed using a six-step thematic analysis. The results make it clear that even though the patients declared that physical activity is essential for them to deal with their disease, most of the participants affirmed that they significatively reduced their levels of physical activity during the pandemic. Physical activity should be promoted in people, even in difficult times, to improve disease outcomes, wellbeing and mental health. Knowing the experiences of these patients enable nursing managers to develop interventions that ensure the delivery of comprehensive nursing care regarding physical activity and health status, in future situations like this pandemic.","Laura, Jonatan, Banwell, BelÃƒÂ©n, Gabriel, AndrÃƒÂ©s","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13784","20220903","COVID-19; Exercise; Health Status; Rheumatoid Arthritis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36998,""
"The Evolving Personal, Professional and Physical Impact on Healthcare Professionals During Three Covid-19 Waves: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to huge pressure on not only healthcare systems, but also on healthcare professionals. As the pandemic continues, the aim of this study is to evaluate how 10 reactions of healthcare professionals evolved during the first 18 months of COVID-19. : A repeated cross-sectional study was performed with eight measurement points between April 2020 and September 2021 in Belgium. Participants were asked how frequently (on a scale of 0 to 10) they experienced positive and negative reactions during normal circumstances and during past week, referred to as before and during COVID-19, respectively. These reactions were stress, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, muscle strain, hypervigilance, leaving profession, headache, doubting knowledge and skills, flashbacks and fear. : In total 13 308 respondents were included in our study. During both the first (March 2020) and second COVID-19 peak (November 2020), the measured personal, professional and physical reactions were significantly higher compared to before COVID-19. The third wave in April 2021 was shorter and less severe with regard to hospital admissions and deaths, yet an important impact on healthcare professionals could still be observed. 'Fatigue', 'stress', 'difficulty sleeping' and 'muscle strain' are the most worrying reactions in September 2021, which are increasing compared to the previous measurements. : Our results showed that acute stress reactions decreased over time but that chronic stress reactions and professional reactions such as 'intent to leave', increased. Healthcare organizations and policy makers should realize that 18 months after the start of COVID-19 almost all of the measured reactions continue to be more prevalent than before COVID-19. Moreover, the continuous increase over the last three measurement periods of the number of healthcare professionals who want to leave their profession is alarming. Continuous follow-up of the personal, professional and physical reactions is more than necessary.","Seys, Peeters, Doggen, Vanhaecht","https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzac069","20220903","COVID-19; Corona; Mental health; Pandemic; Professions; Workforce and workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",36999,""
"Dental trainees' mental health changes, sources of stress, coping strategies, and suggestions for mental health improvement 1 year into the pandemic","The goal of this study was to assess how the mental health of dental trainees has changed during the pandemic and to identify the most stressful aspects of trainees' programs, stress coping strategies, and suggestions for individual and institution-driven solutions to improve wellness. The study focused on dental trainees at the University of Washington who completed a wellness survey in fall 2020 (n = 126; response rate = 35.5%) and spring 2021 (n = 105; response rate = 29.6%). The survey included self-report measures assessing four mental health outcomes: depression, anxiety, isolation from peers, and burnout. Stressful aspects of the training program, coping strategies, and institution-driven solutions were measured with open-ended survey items. The chi-square test was used to compare mental health outcome measures between fall and spring and open-ended survey responses were inductively coded. The prevalence of self-reported depression and anxiety did not change between fall 2020 and spring 2021 (17.2% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.473; 22.4% vs. 23.7%, p = 0.818). Isolation from peers and burnout each significantly increased by almost 20% from fall 2020 to spring 2021 (46.8% vs. 64.3%; p = 0.009 and 26.6% vs. 43.9%; p = 0.017). Trainees identified workload as the most stressful aspect of their program and described using exercise and social support to cope with stress. Trainees suggested institution-supported increases in social events and mental health resources. One year into the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, poor mental health outcomes were common among dental trainees because of high workload and isolation from peers.

"Vestibular syndromes after COVID-19 vaccination: a prospective cohort study","Dizziness and vertigo are common post-COVID-19-vaccination symptoms. We aimed to prospectively evaluate objective central or peripheral-vestibular function in patients with dizziness, vertigo, and postural symptoms that started or worsened after COVID-19-vaccination. Out of 4,137 patients who presented between 01/2021 and 04/2022 at the German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, LMU Munich, we identified 72 patients (mean age 47yrs) with enduring vestibular symptoms following COVID-19-vaccination. All underwent medical history-taking, neurological and neuro-otological workup with bithermal calorics, video head-impulse-test, orthoptics, and audiometry. Diagnoses were based on international criteria. The distribution of diagnoses was compared to a cohort of 39,964 patients seen before the COVID-19-pandemic. Symptom onset was within the first four weeks post-vaccination. The most prevalent diagnoses were somatoform vestibular disorders (34.7%), vestibular migraine (19.4%), or overlap syndromes of both (18.1%). These disorders were significantly overrepresented compared to the pre-pandemic control-cohort. 36% of patients with somatoform complaints reported a positive history of depressive or anxiety disorders. Nine patients presented with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, three with acute unilateral vestibulopathy, and seven with different entities (vestibular paroxysmia, MeniÃƒÂ¨re's disease, polyneuropathy, ocular muscular paresis). Causally related central-vestibular deficits were lacking. Novel peripheral-vestibular deficits were found in four patients. Newly induced persistent vestibular deficits following COVID-19-vaccination were rare. The predominant causes of prolonged vestibular complaints were somatoform vestibular disorders and vestibular migraine, possibly triggered or aggravated by stress-related circumstances due to the COVID-19-pandemic or vaccination. An increase of other central or peripheral vestibular syndromes after COVID-19-vaccination was not observed.","Gerb, Becker-Bense, Zwergal, Huppert","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15546","20220903","COVID-19; Vestibular syndrome; vaccination; vertigo; vestibulopathy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37001,""
"A Pilot Study of the Gut Microbiota Associated With Depressive Symptoms and Sleep Disturbance Among Chinese and Korean Immigrants in the United States","Depression is prevalent among Asian Americans (AsA) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depression often leads to sleep disturbance in this population. The gut microbiota (GM) plays a critical role in mental health and sleep quality, and the composition of the GM is largely unknown among AsA. Examine associations of the GM with depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance among Chinese and Korean American immigrants. Depressive symptoms (PROMIS Short Form-Depression) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) were collected via surveys. PROMIS measure T-score &gt; 55 indicates positive depressive symptoms, and a total PSQI score &gt; 5 indicates sleep disturbance. 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene regions were sequenced from fecal specimens to measure GM. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis effect size were applied to examine associations of the GM with symptoms. Among 20 participants, 55% (<i>n</i> = 11) reported depressive symptoms and 35% (<i>n</i> = 7) reported sleep disturbance. A higher ÃŽÂ±-diversity was marginally associated with lower depressive symptoms: Chao1 (r = -0.39, <i>p</i> = 0.09) and Shannon index (r = -0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.08); ÃŽÂ²-diversity distinguished participants between categories of depressive symptoms (weighted UniFrac, <i>p</i>=0.04) or sleep disturbance (Jaccard, <i>p</i>=0.05). Those with depressive symptoms showed a higher abundance of <i>Actinobacteria,</i> while those without depressive symptoms had a higher abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>. No significant taxa were identified for sleep disturbance. Gut microbial diversity showed promising associations with depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance among Chinese and Korean immigrants. Specific taxa were identified as associated with depressive symptoms.

"Effectiveness of a Mindful Compassion Care Program in reducing burnout and psychological distress amongst frontline hospital nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Recent studies have shown that nurses have been more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than any other group of hospital workers in terms of anxiety, depression, and burnout. Several clinical studies had previously demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness and compassion interventions in reducing burnout and emotional distress amongst healthcare professionals. A parallel-group randomized controlled trial will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a mindfulness and compassion-focused programme on frontline nurses who had been working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-two participants will be recruited from Verona University Hospital Trust (Veneto Region, north-east Italy) and will be divided equally into an intervention group and a control group. Primary outcome will be assessed using the Emotional Exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS). Secondary outcomes will be measured by the Cynicism and Professional Efficacy subscales of the MBI-GS, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Impact of Stressful Events (IES-R), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Forms of Self-Criticising/attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale (FSCRS). The study aims to fill a gap in the literature and present a scientifically validated intervention for those healthcare professionals most exposed to the stressful conditions of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"A machine learning analysis of COVID-19 mental health data","In late December 2019, the novel coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2) and the resulting disease COVID-19 were first identified in Wuhan China. The disease slipped through containment measures, with the first known case in the United States being identified on January 20th, 2020. In this paper, we utilize survey data from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research and apply several statistical and machine learning models and techniques such as Decision Trees, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Random Forests, Gradient Tree Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Synthetic Minority Oversampling, and Chi-Squared Test to analyze the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the mental health of frontline workers in the United States. Through the interpretation of the many models applied to the mental health survey data, we have concluded that the most important factor in predicting the mental health decline of a frontline worker is the healthcare role the individual is in (Nurse, Emergency Room Staff, Surgeon, etc.), followed by the amount of sleep the individual has had in the last week, the amount of COVID-19 related news an individual has consumed on average in a day, the age of the worker, and the usage of alcohol and cannabis.","Rezapour, Hansen","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-19314-1","20220902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37004,""
"Perceptions, Coping Strategies, and Mental Health of Residents during COVID-19","Since the inception of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United States has been the leader in cases and deaths. Healthcare workers treating these severely ill patients are at risk of many deleterious consequences. Residents, in particular, may be affected by physical as well as psychological consequences. Because data are sparse on perceptions, coping strategies, and the mental health of residents during COVID-19, we explored these issues in survey data from a community-based academic program in the southeastern United States. In May 2020, when US deaths from COVID-19 reached 100,000, we administered multiple-choice online anonymous surveys to assess resident perceptions, coping strategies, and self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. We used the COPE inventory to assess coping strategies and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire. A total of 59 (41.3%) of 143 eligible residents completed the survey, 52 (88.1%) of whom believed that they were likely or very likely to become infected with COVID-19. If infected, 17 (28.8%) believed that their illness would be serious or very serious. The top three strategies to cope with COVID-19 included acceptance, self-distraction, and use of emotional support. With respect to depression, anxiety, and stress, all of the mean scores were in the normal range. During COVID-19, residents in a southern community-based program with an academic affiliation reported effective coping strategies, predominantly acceptance, self-distraction, and use of emotional support. They reported concerns about becoming infected and, if they did, that their illness would likely be serious. Finally, they have not experienced depression, anxiety, or reported stress. The findings may be restricted in generalizability to a southern community-based program with an academic affiliation.","DeDonno, Ferris, Molnar, Haire, Sule, Hennekens, Wood","https://doi.org/10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001439","20220902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37005,""
"New prescription fills of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Los Angeles County, California","This study examined whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with changes in new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescription fills. Using IQVIA Xponent data on new SSRI fills in Los Angeles (L.A.) County from March 2019 to June 2021, the authors implemented an interrupted time series analysis comparing the monthly volume and trend of overall fills and fills by age and gender from before to after the pandemic declaration. The rate of new SSRI prescription fills briefly decreased after the pandemic declaration but then consistently increased through the rest of the study period. These increases were primarily driven by women, young adults (i.e., 18-39Ã¢â‚¬Â¯year-olds), and those under 18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old. Sample is limited to one county and may not be generalizable to other municipalities. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significant increases in new SSRI fills among women, young adults, and those under 18. These increases were relatively small compared to increases in depressive symptoms during the same time period.","Levin, Acosta, Faherty","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.119","20220902","COVID-19; Depression; SSRIs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37006,""
"Global burden of mental health problems among children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review","Mental health problems among children and adolescents are increasingly reported amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In this umbrella review, we aimed to synthesize global evidence on the epidemiologic burden and correlates of child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) problems during this pandemic from existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Adopting the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, we evaluated 422 citations and identified 17 eligible reviews with medium to high methodological quality. Most of the reviews reported a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, suicidal behavior, stress-related disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other mental health problems. Also, factors associated with CAMH such as age, gender, place of residence, educational attainment, household income, sedentary lifestyle, social media and internet use, comorbidities, family relationships, parents' psychosocial conditions, COVID-19 related experiences, closure of schools, online learning, and social support were reported across reviews. As most studies were cross-sectional and used nonrepresentative samples, future research on representative samples adopting longitudinal and intervention designs is needed. Lastly, multipronged psychosocial care services, policies, and programs are needed to alleviate the burden of CAMH problems during and after this pandemic.","Hossain, Nesa, Das, Aggad, Tasnim, Bairwa, Ma, Ramirez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114814","20220902","Adolescent health; COVID-19; Child health; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Pandemic; Psychiatry; Psychology; Systematic review; Umbrella review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37007,""
"Effects of Social Media Use on Adolescent Connectivity and Emotions During Pandemic-Induced School Closures: A Qualitative Analysis","The recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to examine social media and technology use during a time in which technology served as adolescents' primary form of socialization. The literature is mixed regarding how increased screen time during this period affected adolescent mental health and well-being. The mechanisms by which screen time use affected adolescent psychosocial outcomes is also unknown. To deepen our understanding of how social media and technology use, social connectivity, and emotional well-being intersected during pandemic-related school closures. English-speaking adolescents ages 13-17 were recruited on Instagram for a brief screening survey; 39 participants were purposefully selected to complete a semi-structured interview regarding their social media/technology use during the pandemic. Interview summaries were abstracted from recordings and deductive codes were created for the primary question stems. These codes were subsequently reviewed for main themes. Main themes were 1) Adolescent social media and technology use during school closures usually allowed for more and easier social connectivity, but the amount and relative ease of connectivity differed according to purpose and type of use. 2) Emotions, particularly those of stress and happiness, were connected to whether adolescents actively or passive engaged with social media and technology. Our results suggest a nuanced relationship between social media and technology use and adolescent social support and emotional well-being, including during the pandemic. Specifically, how adolescents use and/or engage with online platforms greatly influences their ability to connect with others as well as feelings of stress and happiness. In the context of the ongoing pandemic and as technology in general remains at the core of the adolescent experience, future research should continue to examine how adolescents navigate and utilize online spaces, in beneficial and harmful ways. This will inform education and interventions that foster healthy social media and technology habits.","Liang, Kutok, Rosen, Burke, Ranney","https://doi.org/10.2196/37711","20220902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37008,""
"Differences in Suicidality in Non-Treatment-Seeking and Treatment-Seeking Law Enforcement Officers: A Cross-sectional Study","Law enforcement officers (LEOs) are exposed to high levels of occupational trauma and face added stress from heightened public scrutiny and COVID-19, which may result in suicide. It is crucial to understand differences between LEOs who seek treatment and those who do not. We compared LEOs from the same greater metropolitan area who sought treatment with those who did not. Participants completed validated measures assessing posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety, depression, and suicidality. The treatment-seeking sample scores were higher on all standardized assessments. Bivariate logistic regression results indicated that the non-treatment-seeking sample's odds of experiencing suicidality were 1.76 times the odds for the treatment seeking sample. Conclusions: This suggests that many LEOs experiencing suicidality may not be seeking treatment and highlights the role that posttraumatic stress disorder may play in determining whether LEOs seek treatment or not.","Ponder, Beauchamp, Schuman, Carbajal, Jetelina, Galusha","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002618","20220902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37009,""
"Assessing quality of care and observance of human rights in residential mental health facilities in Greece through the WHO QualityRights tool kit","In this paper, we present and reflect upon the process of evaluating two residential mental health facilities in Thessaloniki, Greece, through the WHO QualityRights tool kit. The QualityRights tool kit is a structured process for assessing quality of care and human rights in mental health and social care facilities, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), introduced by the World Health Organization in 2012. We have piloted the use of the Toolkit in two supported accommodation facilities, a hostel and a service supervising independent living in apartments, for individuals with long-term severe mental health problems in the region of Thessaloniki. In this paper, we present the methodology and process of evaluating the facilities, including the challenges posed to the evaluation process by restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We showcase the outcome of this evaluation through presenting a summary of the results and the ensuing recommendations for improvement. Finally, we reflect on the usefulness, appropriateness and relevance of the Toolkit for evaluating mental health care facilities in the particular context of contemporary Greece.","Georgaca, Plataniti, Vardoulaki, Pampouchidou, Nomidou, Chondros","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12874","20220902","Human rights; Mental health services; Quality of care; Service evaluation; WHO QualityRights tool kit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37010,""
"The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-3 (NEMESIS-3): Objectives, methods and baseline characteristics of the sample","NEMESIS-3 (Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-3) is a psychiatric epidemiological cohort study of the Dutch general population that replicates and expands on two previous NEMESIS-studies conducted in 1996-1999 and 2007-2018 respectively. The main aims of NEMESIS-3 are to provide up-to-date information on the prevalence, incidence, course and consequences of mental disorders, their risk indicators, and to study the relevant time trends. This paper gives an overview of the objectives and methods of NEMESIS-3, especially of the recently completed first wave, and describes the sample characteristics. NEMESIS-3 is based on a multistage, stratified random sampling of individuals aged 18-75Ã‚Â years. Face-to-face interviews were laptop computer-assisted and held at the respondent's home. A slightly modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 3.0 was used to assess both Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) and DSM-5 mental disorders. Two follow-up waves are planned three and sixÃ‚Â years after baseline. In the first wave, performed from November 2019 to March 2022, 6194 individuals were interviewed: 1576 respondents before and 4618 respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The average interview duration was 91Ã‚Â min and the response rate was 54.6%. The sample consisted of 50.4% women and had a mean age of 47.9Ã‚Â years. The sample was reasonable nationally representative, although some sociodemographic groups were somewhat underrepresented. Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, we were able to build a large and comprehensive dataset of good quality, permitting us to investigate the latest trends in mental health status, various new topics related to mental health, and the extent to which the pandemic has had an effect on the population's mental health.","Ten Have, Tuithof, van Dorsselaer, Schouten, de Graaf","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1942","20220902","general population; longitudinal; psychiatric epidemiology; survey methodology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37011,""
"Core competencies of peer workers who use pulse oximeters to supplement their overdose response in British Columbia","Peer workers (those with lived/living experience of substance use) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives in British Columbia, Canada. The onset of the coronavirus disease pandemic has significantly compounded the impact of the overdose crisis. Peer workers are integral in supporting people who use substances. However, despite the important work they do, peer workers often lack formalized credibility and do not have the same resources available to them as service providers without lived experience. The peer-led project titled the Peer2Peer Project implemented several support programs for peer workers, including providing pulse oximeters to peer workers to supplement their overdose response procedures. This study was a component of a larger evaluation of the pulse oximeter program at two organizations in BC. The study aims to highlight the competencies of peer workers who use pulse oximeters. Telephone interviews were conducted with seven peer workers who were given pulse oximeters. The transcripts were thematically coded using Covert et al.'s framework of core competencies of community health workers to compare our sample with other widely recognized professions. We found that peer workers who used pulse oximeters described several core competencies in their work and these were aligned with Covert et al.'s core competencies for community health workers, including assessment, community health practice, communication, diversity and inclusion, professional practice, and disease prevention and management. By aligning peer workers' skills to those of community health workers, we create awareness on the competencies of peer workers in using oximeters to supplement overdose response and advocate for them to receive more recognition and respect within the workplace. Further, our findings act as groundwork for future research in identifying the professional proficiencies of peer workers.","Mamdani, Feldman-Kiss, McKenzie, Knott, Cameron, Voyer, van Norren, Scott, Pauly, Buxton","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273744","20220902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37012,""
"Food security and well-being among older, rural Americans before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many aspects of our lives. Older adults, those with less income or fewer resources, and those living in rural parts of the United States are potentially more vulnerable. To understand the negative impact of COVID-19 on perceived food security, physical and mental health, and loneliness in a sample of older, rural, low-income adults in the United States, we use results from a mailed survey in which residents of four Indiana counties contrasted their status during the early period of the pandemic to their typical pre-pandemic status. We test for significant changes in status and what predicts negative impacts to food security, health, and loneliness. We asked respondents to report on both pre-pandemic and since-pandemic experiences in the instrument, which was administered after the pandemic had begun, in May 2020. We measure food security using the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (six-item short form; HFSSM), physical and mental health using the Centers for Disease Control's Healthy Days Measures (HRQOL-4), and loneliness using the UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale. A binomial test identified significant declines in status for all three measures. Logistic regressions identified factors associated with each of the measures worsening. Fear of going to the store or food pantry was associated with all three measures. Decreased store hours and closed food pantries were associated with lower food security. More education, fewer years of age, being female, decreased income, and stockpiling were associated with more reported days of poor physical or mental health. Fewer years of age, lack of transportation, and eating less often with others were associated with perceived increased loneliness. The pandemic had a negative impact on respondents' food security, unhealthy days, and loneliness, but different factors were associated with each measure for this population. Our findings provide insight for targeted recovery efforts.","Giroux, Waldman, Burris, Valliant, Babb, Stafford, Fobi, Czebotar, Knudsen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274020","20220902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37013,""
"Mood symptoms predict COVID-19 pandemic distress but not vice versa: An 18-month longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale, with research emerging to indicate that it negatively impacted the population's mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess whether the pandemic led to an increase in depression and anxiety across participants or whether a diathesis-stress model would be more appropriate. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intolerance at two baselines six months apart as well as during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic exactly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indicated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandemic-related distress. Pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity. These findings underscore the necessity of longitudinal designs and diathesis-stress models in the study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also emphasize that individuals with higher rates of baseline psychopathology are as particularly at risk for higher levels of distress in response to disaster-related stressors.","Katz, Yovel","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273945","20220902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37014,""
"Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity prospectively predicts distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: The protective effect of insomnia treatment","The COVID-19 pandemic is a rare stressor that has precipitated an accompanying mental health crisis. Prospective studies traversing the pandemic's onset can elucidate how pre-existing disease vulnerabilities augured risk for later stress-related morbidity. We examined how pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted maladaptive stress reactions and depressive symptoms in response to, and during, the pandemic. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial from 2016 to 2017 comparing digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) against sleep education (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 208). Thus, we also assessed whether dCBT-I moderated the association between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and pandemic-related distress. Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity was measured at baseline using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test. In April 2020, participants were recontacted to report pandemic-related distress (stress reactions and depression). Controlling for the treatment condition and the degree of COVID-19 impact, higher pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted more stress reactions (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.13, Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07 SE, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.045) and depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.22, Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07 SE, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001) during the pandemic. Further, the odds of reporting clinically significant stress reactions and depression during the pandemic were over twice as high in those with high pre-pandemic sleep reactivity. Notably, receiving dCBT-I in 2016-2017 mitigated the relationship between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and later stress reactions (but not depression). Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted psychological distress 3-4Ã¢â‚¬â€°years later during the COVID-19 pandemic, and dCBT-I attenuated its association with stress reactions, specifically. Sleep reactivity may inform prevention and treatment efforts by identifying individuals at risk of impairment following stressful events.","Reffi, Drake, Kalmbach, Jovanovic, Norrholm, Roth, Casement, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13709","20220902","adversity; chronic stress; longitudinal; prevention; resilience; risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37015,""
"Parents and school-aged children's mental well-being after prolonged school closures and confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico: a cross-sectional online survey study","This study aimed to determine parents' and school-aged children's mental well-being after experiencing confinement and prolonged school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional design, an online survey was applied to parents of school-aged children inquiring about their mental well-being and COVID-19 pandemic changes in their home and working lives. To assess the presence of depression, anxiety and stress in parents, the participants responded to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 scale. To assess psychosocial dysfunction and sleep disturbances in children, participants responded to the Pediatric Symptom Checklist and the Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire. A total of 209 parents answered the questionnaire, most of them were female (87.1%) with a mean age of 40 years. The prevalence of anxiety, stress and parental depression symptoms were 35.9%, 28.2% and 25.4%, respectively. Children's mean age was 8.9 years, the prevalence of children's psychosocial dysfunction was 12%, while their sleep disturbance symptoms were 59.8%. 10.5% of children were suffering both outcomes. We found a bidirectional relationship between parents' and children's mental health outcomes. Parental depression symptoms were associated with experiencing COVID-19 infection within the household, having children with pre-existing medical diagnoses, children's psychosocial dysfunction and sleep disturbances. Children's psychosocial dysfunction was associated with parental depression and changes in their school routine. Children's sleep disturbances were associated with parental anxiety, younger age, increased use of electronic devices, night-time awakenings and shorter sleep time. Our results support the impact of long confinement and school closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexican children and parents' mental well-being. We advocate for specific mental health interventions tailored to respond to parents and children at risk of mental well-being distress.","Leon Rojas, Castorena Torres, Garza-Ornelas, Castillo Tarquino, Salinas Silva, Almanza Chanona, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-de-Ita","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001468","20220902","COVID-19; Child Psychiatry; Psychology; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37016,""
"Validating the interpersonal theory of suicide among older adultspre- and peri-COVID-19 pandemic","Global suicide rates are highest among older adults, and especially older men, yet proximal predictors of suicidal ideation in older age remain poorly understood. This study tested the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide in older men and women by investigating whether perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness and/or their interaction are proximal predictors of suicidal ideation before versus during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The sample (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°208) included healthy community-dwelling older Australian persons surveyed face-to-face pre-pandemic (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°102), or online peri-pandemic (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°106). Depression, social interaction, social satisfaction, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness were assessed as predictors of suicidal ideation. Perceived burdensomeness was a more proximal predictor of suicidal ideation among older adults than depression or thwarted belongingness. Suicidal ideation and perceived burdensomeness were higher in men than women, but sex did not moderate the influence of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness or social satisfaction on suicidal desire. The interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness predicted more additional variance in suicidal ideation in the older persons surveyed during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to those surveyed before the pandemic. Suicidal ideation among older persons peri-pandemic is discussed, and recommendations are made for age-specific suicide prevention strategies.","Okan, Bilson, Zhong, Weidemann, Bailey","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2116402","20220902","Suicide; burdensomeness; depression; older persons","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37017,""
"Longitudinal Correlates of Suicide Ideation in People who use Drugs during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Some individuals may be more vulnerable to increased suicide-related thoughts and behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic but few studies have investigated risk factors that may be more predictive/specific to particular populations that are established to have a high risk for suicide, including gender differences in risk factors. We conducted a longitudinal study investigating risk factors for suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults who use alcohol and other drugs. Participants completed up to three surveys over a six-month follow-up period. Trait differences in substance use, COVID exposure/worry, trauma exposure, mood and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were investigated between individuals who presented with suicide ideation during course of study, compared to those that did not. Interactions with gender was investigated. State-related changes that relate to fluctuations in suicide ideation were also investigated (within subject design). A total of 214 participants were enrolled (61% women, age <sub>mean</sub> = 33 years, 45% presenting with suicide ideation during the course of the study). Greater frequency of vaping and using tobacco, opiates, and other substances, greater depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, and greater COVID exposure and COVID-related worry were observed in individuals who presented with suicide ideation, compared to those that did not (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0042). Increases in suicide ideation (within subject) was associated with increases in the frequency of alcohol and vaping, COVID-related worry, and PTSD symptoms (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05).

"Benefits of a 3-month cycle of weekly virtual museum tours in community dwelling older adults: Results of a randomized controlled trial","Museums can be instrumental in fostering social inclusion and may improve the overall health of the older population. Over the course of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, many older adults suffered as a result of confinement measures, which may have accelerated the processes that lead to physical frailty and increased mental health risks. This study aims to examine whether a 3-month cycle of weekly virtual tours of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) may have improved feelings of social inclusion, wellbeing and quality of life, and reduced physical frailty in older adults living within the community of Montreal. A total of 106 older adults, who were community-dwellers living in Montreal (Quebec, Canada), were recruited for a randomized controlled trial in two parallel groups (intervention with <i>n</i> = 53 <i>vs</i> control with <i>n</i> = 53) between January and April 2022. The intervention consisted of a 3-month cycle of weekly virtual museum tours of the MMFA. Social isolation, wellbeing, quality of life and frailty were evaluated using validated scales that were assessed on a web platform at baseline (M0) and after 3 months (M3) in the intervention group. The control group completed the same assessment according to the same schedule. The outcomes were the mean scores at M0 and M3, and changes in mean scores between M0 and M3. The intervention group showed significant improvements in their social isolation, wellbeing, quality of life and frailty scores when compared to the control group, the highest benefits being observed with frailty. The results suggest that the 3-month cycle of weekly virtual MMFA tours may improve social inclusion, physical and mental health in community-dwelling older adults living in Montreal. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05046288, identifier NCT05046288.","Beauchet, Matskiv, Galery, Goossens, Lafontaine, Sawchuk","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.969122","20220903","art; frailty; museum; older adults; quality of life; social isolation; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37019,""
"Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Traumatized Us Collectively? The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Sleep Factors via Traumatization: A Multinational Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic affects mental health and sleep, resulting in frequent nightmares. Therefore, identifying factors associated with nightmare frequency is important, as it can indicate mental health issues. The study aimed to investigate increases in nightmare frequency comparing the pre-pandemic and pandemic period, and identify its risk factors. Further, the mediating role of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms between the pandemic and nightmares is explored. For this cross-sectional survey data were obtained via self-rating online survey (ICOSS: details in Partinen et al, 2021), which was open to anyone older than 18 years. The final volunteer sample consisted of 15,292 participants, divided according to their nightmare frequency (high: Ã¢â€°Â¥1-2 nights/week; low: &lt;1-2 nights/week). A total of 9100 participants were excluded if answers on variables of interest were missing or receiving rewards for participation. Chi-square tests identified changes of nightmare frequency. Predictors of high nightmare frequency were assessed using logistic regression and presented as Odds Ratios. Post-hoc mediation models were used to investigate the role of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The mean age was 41.63 (SD=16.55) with 64.05% females. High nightmare frequency increased significantly from 13.24% to 22.35% during the pandemic. Factors associated with it included self-reported PTSS (OR=2.11), other mental disorders and various sleep disorders or problems. Financial burden due to the pandemic, confinement, having had COVID-19, and work situation during the pandemic were associated with nightmare frequency, those relations were partly mediated through PTSS. Our results display the pandemic influence on nightmare frequency, which in turn connects to multiple mental health and sleep factors. These relations were partly mediated through PTSS. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have caused traumatization of a substantial proportion of society. Health care workers should consider nightmares in their screening routines, as it might indicate PTSS and/or other mental and sleep disorders.","Holzinger, Nierwetberg, Chung, Bolstad, Bjorvatn, Chan, Dauvilliers, Espie, Han, Inoue, Leger, MacÃƒÂªdo, Matsui, Merikanto, Morin, Mota-Rolim, Partinen, Plazzi, Penzel, Sieminski, Wing, Scarpelli, Nadorff, De Gennaro","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S368147","20220903","COVID-19; collective trauma; mental health; nightmares; post-traumatic stress disorder; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37020,""
"Longitudinal changes in COVID-19 concern and stress: Pandemic fatigue overrides individual differences in caution","Pandemic fatigue describes a phenomenon whereby individuals experience a decrease in COVID-19 concern over time, despite their risk for infection remaining stable, or even increasing. Individual differences in the experience of pandemic fatigue may have important implications for people's adherence to public health recommendations. Using data collected from a large community cohort in McLennan County, TX, longitudinal changes in COVID-19-related concern, stress, and affect across three appointments separated by approximately 4 weeks (July-November 2020) were examined. About 495, 349, and 286 participants completed one, two, and three appointments, respectively. Changes to stress physiology and local travel over time were also analyzed. Results of a latent class growth analysis revealed four distinct classes of individuals: (a) low concern, low stress, (b) moderate concern, moderate stress, (c) moderate concern, low stress, and (d) high concern, high stress. Despite differences between latent classes in initial levels of concern, stress, and negative affect, levels of each variable decreased over time for all groups. While this reduction of concern did not coincide with changes in local travel, it was reflected in heart rate and blood pressure. Together, these results suggest a general trend of pandemic fatigue in the sample, even for those with moderate-to-high levels of initial COVID-19 stress and concern. Such findings may provide insights into the expected challenges of promoting compliance with public health recommendations as the pandemic continues.","Gassen, Nowak, Henderson, Weaver, Baker, Muehlenbein","https://doi.org/10.1177/22799036221119011","20220903","COVID fatigue; COVID-19; Pandemic fatigue; growth mixture modeling; latent class analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37021,""

"Burnout, psychopathology and purpose in life in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in the workload of healthcare workers that, together with the risks associated with exposure to this new virus, has affected their mental health. The objective of the current study was to determine the prevalence of psychopathology and burnout syndrome in healthcare workers and the predictive role of purpose in life and moral courage in this relationship. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 115 Spanish healthcare workers. Participants with burnout had higher anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.001), depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), post-traumatic stress (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and alcohol consumption (<i>p</i> = 0.03) levels. The different components of burnout (emotional fatigue and despersonalization) were associated with the occurrence of anxiety (OR = 0.31) and depression (OR = 0.26), respectively. A strong purpose in life decreased emotional fatigue (OR = -0.39) depersonalization (OR = -0.23) scores, increased personal accomplishment (OR = 0.52), subsequently reducing burnout levels (OR = -0.45). Purpose in life was most strongly related to decreased levels of burnout.

"Effect of distinct psychological interventions on changes in self-reported distress, depression and loneliness among older adults during COVID-19","Older adults have been considered a primary at-risk population during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and many efforts have been and still are directed toward supporting them and enhancing their capacity to cope with the pandemic. Evidence shows that by enhancing proactive coping abilities through psychological interventions, in which cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness techniques are taught and practiced effectively, these interventions have supported older adults throughout the pandemic. However, the underlying mechanisms by which specific intervention components affect various mental states such as distress, depression and loneliness among older adults remain unclear and warrant investigation. To determine the effect of an intervention using cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness techniques on changes in distress, depression and loneliness. We performed a secondary analysis on data from a previous study in which community-dwelling older adults attended a short-term, internet-based intervention during the first COVID-19 wave in Israel. The intervention included seven sessions during which various cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness techniques were learned and practiced. In-session changes in psychological distress were measured using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), which participants rated at the beginning and end of each session. Participants also filled out questionnaires that evaluated levels of depression [Patient Health Ques-tionnaire (PHQ-9)] and loneliness (UCLA loneliness Scale) prior to and after the entire intervention process. The effect of in-session changes in the SUDS on changes in post-intervention depression and loneliness levels were assessed, as a proxy for distinct technique effectiveness. The findings indicated in-session differences in terms of a decrease in psychological distress (SUDS). Sessions that included relaxation exercises and guided imagery, as well as sessions that included cognitive restructuring and mindfulness meditation, demonstrated the largest decreases in in-session psychological distress (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 35%). Two multivariate regression models, one for levels of post-intervention depression (PHQ-9 score) and the other for levels of post-intervention loneliness (UCLA loneliness score), were fitted. The results revealed two statistically significant explanatory variables for depression: The SUDS difference for sessions in which cognitive restructuring and mindfulness meditation were practiced, beta = -0.25, 95%CI: -1.23 to -0.1, and the pre-intervention level of depression, beta = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.37-0.75. The second model for loneliness revealed only one significant explanatory variable: The SUDS difference for sessions in which relaxation and guided imagery were practiced, beta = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.14-0.65. Different psychological techniques seem to have different effects on distress, loneliness and depression. Understanding the pathways by which distinct techniques affect negative mental symptoms has implications for future intervention design.","Shapira, Yeshua-Katz, Sarid","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i7.970","20220903","Aged; COVID-19; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Depression; Intervention studies; Loneliness; Subjective Units of Distress Scale","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37024,""

"Influencing factors, prediction and prevention of depression in college students: A literature review","The high prevalence of depression among college students has a strong negative impact on individual physical and mental health, academic development, and interpersonal communication. This paper reviewed the extant literature by identifying nonpathological factors related to college students' depression, investigating the methods of predicting depression, and exploring nonpharmaceutical interventions for college students' depression. The influencing factors of college students' depression mainly fell into four categories: biological factors, personality and psychological state, college experience, and lifestyle. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the severity of depression among college students worldwide and poses grave challenges to the prevention and treatment of depression, given that the coronavirus has spread quickly with high infection rates, and the pandemic has changed the daily routines of college life. To predict and measure mental health, more advanced methods, such as machine algorithms and artificial intelligence, have emerged in recent years apart from the traditional commonly used psychological scales. Regarding nonpharmaceutical prevention measures, both general measures and professional measures for the prevention and treatment of college students' depression were examined in this study. Students who experience depressive disorders need family support and personalized interventions at college, which should also be supplemented by professional interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and online therapy. Through this literature review, we insist that the technology of identification, prediction, and prevention of depression among college students based on big data platforms will be extensively used in the future. Higher education institutions should understand the potential risk factors related to college students' depression and make more accurate screening and prevention available with the help of advanced technologies.","Liu, Guo, Zhang, Gao","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i7.860","20220903","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Depression; Machine learning; Prediction; Prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37026,""
"Believing processes during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals with bipolar disorder: An exploratory study","Believing or ""credition"" refers to psychological processes that integrate the cognitions and emotions that influence our behavior. In the credition model by Angel and Seitz, four parameters are postulated: proposition, certainty, emotion and mightiness. It is assumed that believing processes are influenced by both the individual as well as socio-cultural factors and external circumstances. External or environmental circumstances can include threatening situations such as the ongoing pandemic. It has been hypothesized that believing processes related to the pandemic differ between individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy controls (HC). To investigate credition in individuals with BD during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Psychiatrically stable individuals with BD (<i>n</i> = 52) and age- and sex matched HC (<i>n</i> = 52) participated in an online survey during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey took place between April 9<sup>th</sup> and June 4<sup>th</sup>, 2020, in Austria. Participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a dedicated Believing Questionnaire assessing four parameters of credition (proposition, certainty, emotion and mightiness). The MAXQDA software was used to analyze the qualitative data. Statistical analyses included analyses of variance, a multivariate analysis of variance and a multivariate analysis of co-variance. Individuals with BD reported significantly more negative propositions [<i>F</i> (1,102) = 8.89, <i>P</i> = 0.004, ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> <sub>p</sub> = 0.08] and negative emotions [WelchÃ‚Â´s <i>F</i> (1,82.46) = 18.23, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> <sub>p</sub> = 0.18], while HC showed significantly more positive propositions [<i>F</i> (1,102) = 7.78, <i>P</i> = 0.006, ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> <sub>p</sub> = 0.07] and emotions [<i>F</i> (1,102) = 14.31, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> <sub>p</sub> = 0.12]. In addition, individuals with BD showed a higher incongruence between their propositions and their emotions [<i>F</i> (1,102) = 9.42, <i>P</i> = 0.003, ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> <sub>p</sub> = 0.08] and showed strong correlations between the parameters of the Believing Questionnaire and their psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.51-0.77, all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).

"COVID-19 survivors: Multi-disciplinary efforts in psychiatry and medical humanities for long-term realignment","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic represents an enduring transformation in health care and education with the advancement of smart universities, telehealth, adaptive research protocols, personalized medicine, and self-controlled or artificial intelligence-controlled learning. These changes, of course, also cover mental health and long-term realignment of coronavirus disease 2019 survivors. Fatigue or anxiety, as the most prominent psychiatric ""long coronavirus disease 2019"" symptoms, need a theory-based and empirically-sound procedure that would help us grasp the complexity of the condition in research and treatment.

"SARS-CoV-2 consequences for mental health: Neuroinflammatory pathways linking COVID-19 to anxiety and depression","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been linked to an increased prevalence of mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress in people worldwide due to several factors, including fear of infection; social isolation; difficulty in adapting to new routines; lack of coping methods; high exposure to social media, misinformation, and fake reports; economic impact of the measures implemented to slow the contagion and concerns regarding the disease pathogenesis. COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1ÃŽÂ², IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-ÃŽÂ±, and other inflammation-related factors. Furthermore, invasion of the central nervous system by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may potentially contribute to neuroinflammatory alterations in infected individuals. Neuroinflammation, a consequence of psychological stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may also play a role in the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the general population.

"Exploring how greenspace programmes might be effective in supporting people with problem substance use: a realist interview study","Greenspace programmes are health projects run outside in nature, typically with the aim of improving mental health. Research suggests that programmes may also be effective in supporting people with problem substance use (PSU), but there is limited understanding of the key components that make them successful for this client group. Previous work has claimed that a realist-informed intervention framework for greenspace programmes for mental health could be transferable to programmes that support people with PSU, and that this could provide insight into the causal processes within programmes. However, this claim is yet to be explored in depth. The aim of this study was to further test, refine, and consolidate the proposed framework to show how greenspace programmes could support people with PSU. Using a realist approach, 17 participants (8 programme staff; 9 wider stakeholders) were interviewed about contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes (CMOs) relative to greenspace programmes for mental health and PSU. Semi-structured interviews were used since they facilitated exploration of the proposed framework but were flexible enough to allow identification of new CMOs for framework refinement. Interviews were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed inductively and deductively against the proposed framework. Findings supported the proposed framework and indicated that greenspace programmes support people with poor mental health and PSU due to: feelings of escape; space to reflect; physical activity; self-efficacy; feelings of purpose; relationships; and shared experiences. However, data showed that programmes must also consider: explicit intervention focus to ensure adequate support for clients; existing challenges with funding and stakeholder buy-in; and the impact of COVID-19. Findings allowed development of a refined framework that shows how greenspace programmes can support people with PSU. The findings of this project are theoretically novel and have practical relevance for those designing greenspace programmes by providing recommendations on how to optimise, tailor, and implement future interventions. Findings could be particularly relevant for academic researchers, multidisciplinary health professionals, and for those working in the third sector, developing and delivering greenspace programmes for people to improve their mental health and to support them with PSU.","Masterton, Parkes, Carver, Park","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14063-2","20220901","Green care; Greenspace; Mental health; Natured-based interventions; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37031,""
"Are we overlooking the obvious? Addressing social determinants of health that contribute to perinatal depression","Mental health disorders among women during the perinatal period are common and cause significant morbidity, yet precise reasons why some women develop depression during this period, and others do not, are, as yet, unknown. Pregnancy may burden populations of women differently, and sociological variables, such as finances, social position, interpersonal resources; and extreme events, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for example, may be as significant as biological determinants. However, current treatment for depression remains focused on the individual woman as the main agent for change. Incorporating a systems-wide approach to diagnosing and treating perinatal depression by addressing structural and systemic determinants may be a more effective way to treat this illness. In this paper, we explore social determinants of health and their correlation with clinical depression in the antenatal period. We also investigate broader, society-wide interventions that may reduce this significant morbidity among women of reproductive age, in both developed and developing nations.","Simhi, Yoselis","https://doi.org/10.1071/PY22002","20220901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-04","",37032,""
