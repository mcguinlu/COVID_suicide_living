"Proposal for a Model of Suicidal Ideation in Medical Students in Colombia: A Simulation Study","La conducta suicida es un problema de salud pÃºblica mundial, y una poblaciÃ³n en la que se presentan altos Ã­ndices de prevalencia es la de estudiantes de Medicina, especialmente en el componente de ideaciÃ³n. Diversos modelos han intentado explicarla, pero son pocos los estudios inferenciales en poblaciÃ³n colombiana. Los modelos de ecuaciones estructurales utilizados en ciencias sociales resultan apropiados para explicar este problema y su poder analÃ­tico permite realizar generalizaciones con cierto grado de precisiÃ³n. Estos anÃ¡lisis requieren una gran cantidad de datos para una estimaciÃ³n robusta, lo que limita su utilidad cuando hay restricciones para acceder a los datos, como sucede actualmente a causa de la COVID-19, y una cuestiÃ³n que destaca en estos modelos es la evaluaciÃ³n del ajuste. Mediante un conjunto de 1.200 datos simulados, se encontrÃ³ un adecuado ajuste del modelo a los datos ( x 524 2 = 1.732,300 ; p < 0,001 ; CFI = 0,97; GFI0= 0,97; TLI = 0,97; RMSEA = 0,04 [0,042-0,046]; SRMR = 0,06) para los predictores depresiÃ³n y carga percibida, cuyos anÃ¡lisis se realizaron en el programa JASP. Se discute el papel de la pertenencia frustrada, la conveniencia del instrumento para evaluarla y consideraciones de seguimiento, evaluaciÃ³n e intervenciÃ³n de la ideaciÃ³n suicida en estudiantes de Medicina. Suicidal behaviour is a global public health problem, and one population group with high prevalence rates is medical students, especially in the ideation component. Various models have tried to explain it, but there are few inferential studies in the Colombian population. The structural equation models used in controlled social sciences to explain this problem and their analytical power allow generalisations to be made with a certain degree of precision. These analyses require a large amount of data for robust estimation, which limits their usability when there are restrictions to access the data, as is the case today due to Covid-19, and a question that stands out in these models is the evaluation of the fit. Through a set of 1,200 simulated data, an appropriate model fit was found ( x 524 2 = 1.732,300 ; p < 0,001 , CFI = 0.97, GFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.04[0.042-0.046], SRMR = 0.06) for the predictors of depression and perceived burdensomeness, which were analysed using the JASP program. The role of thwarted belongingness is discussed, as well as the appropriateness of the assessment instrument used to evaluate it an considerations regarding suicidal ideation monitoring, evaluation and intervention in medical students.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.09.001","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-16","",7164,""
"Factors influencing mental health among American youth in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic","Objective: The article aims to show the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health of American youth. It also aims to identify factors that have an impact on the mental health maintenance of young Americans. The conducted analyses are an attempt at explaining the influence of high psycho-social stress on the mental health of young people. Methods: Secondary data from representative research conducted among the inhabitants of the United States of America on the sample of 10,139 respondents has been used in the analysis. Data is derived from the Pew Research Center, American Trends Panel. Results: The data analysis indicates that among all the age categories the highest levels of mental discomfort have been observed among the youngest Americans aged 18-29. The majority of respondents experienced anxiety and depression. The results of analyses of the youngest respondents (sample n=1083) have shown that there are a few factors which have impact on mental health of the young generation. Males, people living in relationships, practising religion more often, having a better financial situation, conservative beliefs and being devoid of citizenship had a better mental condition. Owned social, economic and cultural resources protect young Americans against the Covid-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The conducted research confirms the hypothesis that younger generations cope with the Covid-19 pandemic and related difficulties the worst. Due to the conducted analyses, the variables responsible for the deterioration of mental health in younger generations may be indicated.","Piotr Dlugosz","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46182-7A6-B6E","20201116","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; anxiety; depression.; the united states of america; mental health; keywords: covid-19; youth","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-16","",7165,""
