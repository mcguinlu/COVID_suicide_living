"Receiving teletherapy in Ireland: The experiences of service users in the public mental health system","Objective Method Results Conclusion The present study explored the experiences of service users of Adult Mental Health and Primary Care services in Ireland in receiving teletherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide an illustration of these experiences which may inform future applications of teletherapy.Semi-structured telephone interviews about participants' experiences with teletherapy were conducted, the transcripts of which were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.Six themes were generated: Early Apprehensions, Adaptations Improving Experiences, The Therapeutic Space, Seeing and Being Seen, Technical Difficulties: The Loss of â€œThe Moment,â€ and The Security of a Pre-Existing Relationship.Generated themes highlight both the range of experiences that clients can have during teletherapy, and some of the most significant factors which influence these experiences. The quality and effectiveness of teletherapy are often susceptible to factors outside of therapists' and clients' control. In most cases, it may be best considered as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, traditional in-person services.

"Psychological Strain of COVID19 and its Effect on Students Learning during Lockdown in Pakistan","People are struggling with a new corona virus emerged from China. This 21st century would be known by COVID19 in future. All the social activities and gathering have been banned due to this virus19. It destroyed the world badly. There are different sectors which have been collapsed and mainly are for example economy, finance, heath, and education sector. A group of people has died due to corona virus in the world. This study was conducted to examine the psychological strain of COVID19 and its effect on students learning during lockdown. It was quantitative and descriptive study. The survey method was used to identify psychological strain of covid19 and its effect on students learning. The population was included university students. Therefore, one hundred and eighty students were selected conveniently as sample of the study. A questionnaire was developed on 5 point likert scale to conduct study. It is concluded that a group of students said they felt pandemic infection in mind and due to this they felt depression. Social movement and gatherings were not possible due to corona virus. They felt anxiety and uncertainty. Results showed that psychological strain of covid19 significantly correlated with students learning. The structural equation modeling showed that the psychological strain of covid19 was correlated and affected students learning in uncertain situation. Therefore, students should spend quarantine time in remembrance of Allah Almighty and His beloved Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to overcome the stress. The students need to think positive in pandemic situation and concentrate on learning.","Saghir, Ahmad Ch, Batool, Ayesha, Nauman Ahmed, Abdullah","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Strain+of+COVID19+and+its+Effect+on+Students+Learning+during+Lockdown+in+Pakistan","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Research Society of Pakistan; 58(4):125, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34019,""

"Examining the associations among moral injury, difficulties with emotion regulation, and symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress among Canadian military members and Veterans: A preliminary study","Introduction: Moral injury (MI) refers to the psychological distress associated with perceived betrayals or perceived transgressions of one's moral values. It has been studied primarily among military personnel and Veterans and has been found to be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric symptoms. Recently, research has begun to investigate MI and its potential risk factors. Difficulties with emotion regulation (ER), which refers to difficulties with managing and moderating emotions, is a transdiagnostic factor associated with several psychiatric conditions, including PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The objective of the current study was to investigate the relations among MI;symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress;and difficulties with ER in a sample of Canadian military personnel and Veterans. A secondary aim was to discuss the potential relevance of these relations for military personnel, Veterans, and front-line health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Assessments of MI, PTSD, depression, anxiety, stress, and difficulties with ER were administered to Canadian military personnel and Veterans. Correlational analyses were used to assess the relation of MI to these symptoms. Results: Increased levels of MI were associated with avoidance and alterations in mood and cognition symptom clusters of PTSD. Perceived betrayals were also significantly correlated with PTSD-related alterations in mood and cognition symptoms. Symptoms of PTSD were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Difficulties with ER were significantly correlated with symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress, but not with MI (p = 0.07). Discussion: These results reveal an association between MI and specific symptom clusters of PTSD, and they highlight the association between difficulties with ER and symptoms of psychiatric illness among Canadian military personnel and Veterans. The potential implications of these findings and future work examining MI in military personnel, Veterans, and front-line health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.

Recemment, les recherches ont commence a porter sur les facteurs de risque potentiels du PM. Les troubles de regulation affective (RA), qui designent les difficultes a gerer et a moderer ses emotions, sont des facteurs transdiagnostiques lies a divers troubles psychiatriques, y compris le TSPT, la depression et l'anxiete. La presente etude vise a examiner les relations entre le PM, les symptomes de TSPT, la depression, l'anxiete, le stress et les troubles de RA aupres d'un echantillon de membres du personnel militaire et de veterans canadiens. Un objectif secondaire consistait a examiner la pertinence potentielle de ces relations pour le personnel militaire, les veterans et les travailleurs de la sante de premiere ligne pendant la pandemie de COVID-19. Methodologie: Les chercheurs ont evalue le PM, le TSPT, la depression, l'anxiete, le stress et les troubles de RA du personnel militaire et des veterans. Ils ont utilise des analyses de correlation pour evaluer le lien entre le PM et ces symptomes. Resultats: Un taux eleve de PM etait relie de maniere significative aux grappes d'evitement, de perturbations de l'humeur et de symptomes cognitifs relatifs aux TSPT. La perception de trahison etait egalement associee de maniere significative aux perturbations de l'humeur et aux symptomes cognitifs lies aux TSPT.

El objetivo de este estudio es caracterizar los motivos de atenciÃ³n de urgencia psiquiÃ¡trica de los jÃ³venes durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en nuestro hospital. Material y mÃ©todos: Este estudio transversal compara las visitas a urgencias de psiquiatrÃ­a y sus caracterÃ­sticas en pacientes jÃ³venes de la provincia de Lleida antes y despuÃ©s de la pandemia con especial atenciÃ³n a los dos estados de alarma y la conducta suicida. La informaciÃ³n sobre el estado sociodemogrÃ¡fico, las principales quejas, el diagnÃ³stico, las caracterÃ­sticas de la conducta suicida y otros datos se obtuvieron de la historia clÃ­nica electrÃ³nica.

"Loneliness, Emotional Eating, and COVID-19 in Youth","Objectives Negative emotions, such as the feeling of loneliness, are significantly associated with emotional eating. As a coping mechanism to regulate and reduce negative emotions, adolescents and young adults are found to lose control and binge. The global pandemic and enforced lockdowns have imposed psychological changes, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. COVID-19 has led to psychiatric morbidity and dietary changes in youth. This study was designed to see if the feeling of loneliness and emotional eating is associated with contraction COVID-19. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using internationally validated questionnaires such as the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), UCLA loneliness scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). An online survey comprised of these questionnaires and the history of diagnosed COVID-positive contractions was administered among undergraduate and graduate students in Karachi, Pakistan. Results Around 10% of the 234 respondents had a high tendency for emotional eating. Adolescents and young adults who had good eating behaviors (a low tendency for emotional eating) were less likely to be COVID positive (ORÂ =Â 0.24;95% CIÂ =Â 0.08, 0.75), than those with a high tendency for emotional eating. Youth who had been COVID-positive had a significantly higher tendency for emotional eating (pÂ =Â 0.02). Around 26% of the students had a loneliness score greater than the average and the median. People who felt less lonely were two times more likely to be COVID negative (ORÂ =Â 2.78;95% CIÂ =Â 1.02, 7.55). Youth with overall good mental health (i.e., experiencing none or mild to moderate depression) were more likely to experience lower anxiety (ORÂ =Â 8.19;95% CIÂ =Â 2.86, 23.48). Conclusions During the corona pandemic, youth feel more lonely and develop a tendency for emotional eating which is linked to being COVID positive. Building on this pilot data, future long-term intervention, and follow-up research are required to establish causation. Until then, mental health counseling and nutrition education may be integrated into education. Equipping academia to cater to the evolving youth demands should become a public health priority.

"Blockchain applications for the healthcare sector: Uses beyond Bitcoin","The year 2020 will always be remembered as a catastrophic year since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 (coronavirus) as a pandemic. The sudden emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the drawbacks in our healthcare systems to handle public health emergencies. It is clear that implementing cutting-edge technology such as blockchain can aid in reducing the devastating effects of healthcare mishaps and promote efficient planning operations and resource deployment. In the healthcare sector, blockchain technology has the potential to improve clinical trial data management by minimizing regulatory approval delays and revitalizing communication between various parties in the supply chain, among other things. Furthermore, the propagation of misinformation has accelerated in recent years, and existing platforms lack the ability to verify the accuracy of data, resulting in public alarm and irrational behavior. As a result, building a blockchain-based tracking system is critical to ensuring that any data related to healthcare are collected in an accurate and trustworthy manner. Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger distribution technology that can make data processing, provenance, and authentication simpler and has the potential to disrupt healthcare. Blockchain is being actively explored in the health sector to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient quality, improve compliance, and make better use of data relevant to healthcare. Nevertheless, the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider specific healthcare needs from the different viewpoints of clients, patients, providers, and regulators is crucial in determining whether blockchain will fulfill the excitement of a technology described as â€œrevolutionaryâ€ and â€œdisruptive.â€ In addition, blockchain approaches must also be attentive to the specific problems facing healthcare relative to other sectors of the economy, in response to the actual needs of healthcare stakeholders. There have been many proposed implementations of blockchain in the healthcare sector, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems. In this chapter, we review the motivations of inculcating blockchain in currently existing EHR systems. The content of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 1 discusses a brief introduction of blockchain along with the EHR system and the current implementation of blockchain in the medical industry. The second section provides a deeper insight into the importance of mobile health, remote monitoring, and the motivations for using blockchain-based EHR systems. The third section will cover the details of a patient-centered blockchain model along with its promising features. The development of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a slew of difficulties around the world. The use of blockchain technology is critical in developing a platform for effectively managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of a precise mechanism to detect new infections and anticipate the coronavirus infection risk is the largest difficulty facing most nations. The numerous characteristics of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability, can aid in pandemic management by detecting breakouts early, expediting drug distribution, and safeguarding user privacy while undergoing treatment.

"Risk management and resilience of schools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","Long-term school closures, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to an unprecedented risk associated with children's education, protection, and well-being. The reopening of schools has to be safe and consistent with each area's COVID-19 health response. In such situations, it is essential to consider the need for school-based services such as immunization and school meals, as well as mental health and psychosocial support. Miyagi University of Education, Sendai, has experienced the reopening of schools after they were closed after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011. This study describes how school risk management and resilience can contribute to successfully reopening schools after the occurrence of disasters caused by natural hazards such as earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as biological hazards such as COVID-19.","Ichinose, Tomonori, Oda, Takashi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Risk+management+and+resilience+of+schools+in+response+to+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pandemic Risk, Response, and Resilience;: 445-456, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34029,""
"Interplay Between Food Insecurity and Stress Among International Students at a University in West Texas","Objectives International students provide the much-needed diversity and enrich the experiences of college students. As the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged economies, impaired food access, and affected mental health globally, international students in the United States (US) did not qualify for government aid, making them more susceptible to food insecurity and stress. Hence, this study objective was to assess international students' food security status and examine the relationship between stress and food insecurity. Methods An online survey was administered to 75 international students at the chosen University from October 2021-December 2021. Food security was evaluated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 10-item food security survey, while stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Independent t-tests were done to observe the statistical differences in student classification, work hours, marital status, and Spearman's correlation to examine the bivariate relationship between food insecurity and stress. Results The results showed 32% of international students were food insecure, with 73% of students experiencing moderate stress and 12% high-stress levels. PSS and food security status did not vary significantly with grade classification, work hours, or marital status. However, the food insecurity rate among international students who migrated within the last year was (43%) twice the rate of those in the country for more than a year (22%). There was a positive correlation between food insecurity and stress (r (71) = .35, pÂ =Â 0.003). Conclusions Food insecurity correlated with stress among participants. Our findings indicate about one-third of international students are food insecure and suggest international students face moderate to high-stress levels, especially during the first year in the new environment. Future nutrition interventions and stress management strategies are essential, especially for international students who migrated within a year.

"Identifying Strategies to Improve Enrollment and Participation in Three Rural Native American WIC Programs","Objectives The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has a strong track record of improving birth and health outcomes in high-risk populations. For the past decade and a half, WIC enrollment among Native American women and children has declined by approximately 40% for reasons that have not yet been elucidated. The objectives of this work are to 1) Understand the individual-, household-, and community-level factors that facilitate and impede participation in three rural tribal WIC programs, and 2) Identify strategies for addressing significant unexplained declines in WIC participation. Methods We partnered with three tribal WIC agencies â€“ two in the Southwest and one in the Midwest â€“ to plan and conduct this formative research. In-depth qualitative interviews (nÂ =Â 35) were conducted with current and former WIC participants, eligible non-participants, WIC staff, tribal health administrators, and managers of food store that accept WIC in each study community. Interview transcripts were inductively coded and crosscutting emergent themes across communities were identified by four researchers. Results Tribal WIC agencies are highly valued for their culturally-competent staff and the integration of traditional knowledge and values into their services. However, participation barriers related to internet and telephone connectivity have become amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a complicated and often embarrassingÂ food shopping experience is a major obstacle to WIC benefit redemption in small rural food stores. Dominant themes differed greatly by community, indicating that intervention strategies to address declines in WIC participation should be tailored to community-level infrastructure, policy, and cultural values, which are unique to each community. Conclusions This work represents an important step toward improving understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the WIC program in rural Native communities and identifying key focus areas for future interventions.

"Body Mass Index and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Score of Pregnant Women & Breastfeeding Mothers During COVID-19 Pandemic","Objectives A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the association between BMI and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score among pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers. Methods An online survey was used to obtain sociodemographic data and EPDS scores from pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers in Indiana from July 27, 2020 until July 30, 2021. Potential participants were invited through a Facebook group. The inclusion criteria were pregnant women and exclusive breastfeeding mothers,18 years of age or older, with a singleton pregnancy, who intended to breastfeed after delivery, and used English as a primary language. Data were collected using Qualtrics and descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation (SD) and percentages, were used to characterize demographic variables. Multiple linear regression was performed to examine the association [beta coefficient (ÃŸ) with 95% confidence interval (CI)] between BMI and EPDS with adjustment for potential confounding factors (e.g., sociodemographic factors). Results A total of 120 participants, including, pregnant women (nÂ =Â 39) and breastfeeding mothers (nÂ =Â 81), had a mean of age 29.69Â Â± 4.37 years, 93.30% described themselves as White race, 59.20% had more than 12 years to 16 years of education, 49.20% worked full time, and 32.50% had an annual income between $85,000â€“149,999. The mean EPDS score was 6.19Â Â± 4.14. The mean (SD) of pre pregnancy BMI (kg/m2) was 27.91Â Â± 5.89Â kg/m2 with a range from 19.20 to 43.00. The participants with obesity had the highest mean EPDS score of 6.46Â Â± 4.28, followed by overweight (6.15Â Â± 4.42) and healthy weight (5.98Â Â± 3.87). After adjusting for age, employment status, education, breastfeeding and pregnancy status, and family income, BMI was not associated with EPDS score [ÃŸ (95% CI) = -0.01 (-0.15, 0.12);pÂ =Â 0.84).

"Rethinking imbalances of power through health communication: Challenges for scholars, practitioners, and activists","In the year 2020, the health impacts of COVID-19 are being felt in the United States and across the globe. During this same year, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Dominique Clayton, Eric Reason, and many other African Americans have been killed as a result of police brutality. The overwhelming sadness of these unwarranted killings and the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color speak to larger systemic issues that are important to acknowledge and locate in the field of health communication, especially as we talk about people historically located on the margins. This chapter aims to describe these extant oppressive systems prior to addressing the health disparities prevalent within our communities. By doing so, we hope to present an argument that encourages health communication scholars to understand, challenge, and hold themselves accountable as practitioners and educators. By recognizing the power structures extant within the forms and processes of scholarship itself, we aim to highlight and acknowledge the truths and experiences of Black, Indigenous, and other peoples of color, as well as people who identify as LGTBQ+ and individuals with disabilities.

"The impact of COVID-19 on cardiology training","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced a dramatic shift in how we practise medicine, with changes in working patterns, clinical commitments and training. Cardiology trainees in the UK have experienced a significant loss in training opportunities due to the loss of specialist outpatient clinics and reduction in procedural work, with those on subspecialty fellowships perhaps losing out the most. Training days, courses and conferences have also been cancelled or postponed. Many trainees have been redeployed during the crisis, and routes of career progression have been greatly affected, prompting concerns about extensions in training time, along with effects on mental health. With the pandemic ongoing and its effects on training likely long-lasting, we examine areas for improvement and opportunities for change in preparation for the â€˜new normalâ€™, including how other specialties have adapted. The increasingly routine use of video conferencing and online education has been a rare positive of the pandemic, and simulation will play a larger role. A more coordinated, national approach will need to be introduced to ensure curriculum components are covered and trainees around the country have equal access to ensure cardiology training in the UK remains world class.","Conway, Samuel, Kirresh, Ali, Stevenson, Alex, Ahmad, Mahmood","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+COVID-19+on+cardiology+training","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The British journal of cardiology; 28(1), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34038,""

"""There is a huge need, and it's growing endlessly"": perspectives of mental health service providers to ethnic Chinese in Aotearoa New Zealand","AIM: Little is known about the experiences of ethnic Chinese accessing mental health services in Aotearoa New Zealand, resulting in uncertainty around their service preferences, and facilitators or barriers to their mental health help-seeking. This paper investigated the experiences of providers of specific mental health services for ethnic Chinese in Aotearoa, their opinions regarding their patients' experience, and their suggestions to improve the system. METHOD: Sixteen health professionals with experience and expertise delivering mental health services for ethnic Chinese were interviewed at 12 organisations across Aotearoa. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using general inductive methods and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Practitioners' experiences revolved heavily around cultural brokerage, which is vital for culturally appropriate care, but this is time-consuming and receives little formal support. Practitioners thought the patient experience was inadequate, with a lack of language and culturally appropriate services leading to delays in help-seeking. Practitioners' suggestions for system improvement included increasing resourcing for research, and for expanding the availability of language and culturally appropriate services. CONCLUSION: Current mental health service provision is inadequate for ethnic Chinese seeking help in Aotearoa, and is causing harm by delaying mental health help-seeking. Decisive Government leadership and deeper collaboration between non-Government organisations (NGOs) will be key to improving mental health service accessibility and outcomes.","Chung, Denzel W.

"Developing and supporting athlete wellbeing: Person first, athlete second","This pioneering book in elite athlete wellbeing brings together the narratives of athletes and wellbeing practitioners in high-performance sport with cutting-edge theorizing from world-leading academics to explore pertinent mental wellbeing matters that present for elite athletes both during and after their careers. The journey of the elite athlete is considered from entering the high-performance system as a youth performer through to retirement, with contributions illuminating the ways in which mental wellbeing can be impacted-both negatively and positively-through common place experiences. Methods of creating holistic high-performance sports cultures along with common mental wellbeing influencers, such as parents, education, faith, injury and (de)selection are explored, as well as the ramifications of uncommon events on mental wellbeing, such as whistle blowing, legal disputes, psychological disorders and COVID-19. Drawing on this analysis, the book then proffers thought-provoking strategies for how the mental wellbeing of both athletes and staff can be understood, developed and supported, ultimately driving elite sport cultural transformation to put the person first and the athlete second. Each chapter presents the wellbeing experience from the vantage of the athlete or the wellbeing practitioner, followed by an academic unpacking of the situation. This makes the book a must read for students and researchers working in sport coaching, sport psychology, applied sport science or sport management, as well as practitioners interested in facilitating a duty of care for high-performing athletes, and working in coaching, sport science support, athlete development programs, NGB policy and administration or welfare services.

"Psychological Impacts among Health Care Personnel during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak is a health emergency, in which health care personnel (HCP) face psychological consequences, working as frontline workers. Therefore, we conducted this study to find out associated psychological impacts among HCP during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline. The reviewed studies were searched from PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Google scholar electronic database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. Results: We searched through 2676 articles, 19 of which were finally included, most of them were cross-sectional and descriptive studies with 12910 participants. HCP were found to be exposed to a variety of psychological problems;anxiety symptoms were reported in 33% (3081 of 9269), depression 28% (2681 of 9487), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 41% (2933 of 7167), sleep problems 26% (903 of 3442), stress 13% (487 of 3496) and fear 67.3% (392 of 582). The severity of impacts was often mild to moderate. The nurses were twice as likely to develop these symptoms. The factors associated with psychological impacts were fear of infection to self and family members, lack of resources and facilities at workplace, demanding work conditions, working closely with COVID-19 clients in intensive care unit and pre-existing medical and psychological problems. Conclusion: Psychological impacts was mild to moderate among majority of HCP during COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome of this review is to provide some utilitarian information for making supportive policies and strategies to improve the psychological wellbeing of frontline HCP during this pandemic.

Understanding the true burden of the disease is important for strengthening the public health system and timely correction of quarantine and mitigation measures in the modern world. The name of the COVID-19 infection appeared due to the English-language abbreviation left-pointing-double-angle Coronavirus Disease 2019 right-pointing-double-angle . Most of the patients with COVID-19 fully recover. However, some of them have residual phenomena-shortness of breath with light physical exertion, a slight cough, pain and discomfort in the shoulder blades, deterioration of heart function, lack of smell and taste, decreased vision, increased fatigue, insomnia, menstrual cycle disorders, hair loss, depression. Residual phenomena significantly reduce the quality of life of patients, especially in elderly and senile people who have had COVID-19, preventing them from leading a previous lifestyle, impairing their performance and ability to withstand psychoemotional loads.

"Investigation of university students' attitudes toward web-based distance education in terms of theoretical and applied courses during the COVID-19 pandemic period","University students had to switch from face-to-face education to web-based distance education (WBDE) owing to new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. While theoretical courses can be provided properly with WBDE, it has been thought that applied courses cannot be sustained effectively by the same way. University students' attitudes toward WBDE regarding theoretical and applied courses taught in physiotherapy and rehabilitation department has not been investigated yet, which was therefore aimed in current study. This cross-sectional study included university students (n=180, 20.14 Â±1.57 years) who still maintain actively WBDE at Izmir Democracy University, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Department. ""Scale for Evaluating Students' Attitudes/Opinions/Thoughts Regarding Applied and Theoretical Courses in Distance Education"" was generated by the researchers and performed through online platform. Scale comprised 26 items. Each item is scored as from 5 (completely agree) to 1 (strongly disagree). Proper factor analyses were performed and repeated until the items were found to be significant. Factor loads of final 16-item ranged from 0.27 to 0.84. All fit indices (x2/SD=1.42) were within acceptable limits. One-dimensional structure of scale was confirmed with 16 items. Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be 0.916, and total correlations of the items varied between 0.422 and 0.772. This scale was found to be highly reliable. Internal consistency between items was high. Maximum score obtained from scale is 80. Total score of students (39.91 Â±10.97) showed that attitudes/opinions/ideas regarding theoretical and applied courses through WBDE were negative. These negative attitudes of students were same according to gender (p&gt;0.05). Attitudes of university students studying at physiotherapy and rehabilitation department through WBDE regarding theoretical and applied courses were negative regardless of gender. This valid and reliable scale should be used to identify need of university students studying at applied sciences about WBDE. Advanced technology products should be urgently synchronized to WBDE.","Bargi, G.; Akkaya, M. E.; Guney, Y.

"Predictors of mental health among male university employees during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic forced university staff to change their work practices. This has had an impact on their work performance and has caused various stresses. Until now, little attention has been paid to males working in this type of educational institution. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on males working in educational institutions. Methods: A quantitative study with three phases of data collection was conducted at eleven Canadian universities. Between 264 and 371 males completed an online questionnaire with validated tests to measure their level of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. Results: During the first year of the pandemic, anxiety and depression scale scores increased while post-traumatic stress scores decreased. This study also revealed that the feelings and meanings that males gave to the pandemic played a very important role in their mental health. Conclusions: University administrations should not underestimate the suffering that male employees may experience during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Maltais, D.; Bergeron-Leclerc, C.; Gauthier, V.; Cherblanc, J.; Boily, E.; Dion, J.; Pouliot, E.; Labra, O.","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jomh1805112","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mens Health; 18(5):11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34048,""
"COVID-19 Traumatic Stress Scale and Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale: psychometric properties in Portuguese male adults","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic constitutes a serious public health emergency. Besides its detrimental social and economic implications, it has generated a negative psychological impact worldwide. Several studies have been carried out concerning psychological impact and mental health related to COVID-19, with the psychological constructs most studied being anxiety, fear, phobia, stress and depression. Other psychological constructs were less studied, namely post-traumatic stress related to COVID-19, as well as preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Thus, the aims of this study were to validate the COVID-19 Traumatic Stress (C19TSS) Scale and the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale (PCIBS) with a Portuguese male adult sample and to measure their invariance across age and education. Methods: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to obtain the final factor structure of the Portuguese version of both scales. Configural, metric and scalar invariance were measured across age and education through multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA). Results: Results showed that both C19TSS and PIBS models fitted the data well. Configural, metric and scalar invariance across age as well as configural and metric invariance across education were found regarding C19TSS. Only configural invariance across education was found regarding PCIBS. Conclusions: The C19TSS and PCIBS are valid and reliable tools for researchers interested in examining post-traumatic stress related to COVID-19 and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19.","Leite, A.; Almeida, A.

"Internal validity of the Covid-19 Anxiety Scale in Peruvian education students","Anxiety is a latent mental health problem in the university population. The demands of virtual education have created great challenges for students in their professional training, social relationships, and physical and mental health. The present study aimed to evaluate the validity based on the internal structure and reliability of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale. It is instrumental and the sample consisted of 306 students from 5 specialisations in the field of Education. The results show an adequate score of the item analysis, correlations, and acceptability. The exploratory factorial analysis confirmed the unidimensionality of the instrument and the confirmatory analysis proved it by means of the goodness-of-fit indices (X2/gl=3,341, TLI=0,963, CFI=0,981, SRMR=0,025, RMSEA=0,076). Factor loadings (&gt;0,5) and reliability indices (alpha(or)(dinal)=0,895, alpha(Cronbach)=0,845 and Omega(McDonald)=0,846) were adequate.

"Establishing physical functioning, quality of life and well-being during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia","The sudden emergence of COVID-19 has led to the confinement of people in homes around the world. In Croatia as well, people were in self-isolation and stayed at home. Since confinement conditions may greatly affect physical and mental health, we investigated the scope of physical activity (PA), well-being and quality of life. A total of 580 adults were surveyed online about PA and health-related quality of life during the lockdown in Croatia. The results have shown that men are more involved in vigorous-intensity PA and have better physical and mental health in almost all domains. When comparing respondents regarding categories of PA, participants with high levels of PA function better physically, have fewer role limitations due to emotional problems and have higher levels of emotional well-being, vitality, and general health. Males, participants with lower BMI, fewer role limitations due to emotional problems, greater vitality and better social functioning have better physical health. Participants who consider that their PA is adequate and engage more in PA, who have fewer role limitations due to physical health, less physical pain, and better general health have better mental health. The results provide insights into the physical and mental components of health during the pandemic. This supports the premise that physical and mental health are highly dependent, and that there is a need to promote the importance of PA, especially for women and those who are less physically active in pandemic times.","Kokic, I.

"Factors Affecting Negative Attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccines","The aim of this study is to examine the factors affecting negative attitudes (vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination) towards vaccines. Data of 4004 people were collected online. Although vaccine hesitancy and anti vaccination attitudes are two different concepts, there is a strong positive relationship between them. In this study, explanatory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis are used for vaccine questions. Then, quantile regression models at 10p, 50p and 90p values were calculated separately for these two variables (vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination). As a result of the estimation, age, gender, education, household income, belief in conspiracy theories, political views, religious involvement are significant predictors. In addition, trust in science, doctors, the government, vaccine companies, COVID-19 vaccines and herbal treatments are other predictive variables. Negative attitudes towards vaccines are relatively higher among the poor, unemployed and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To reduce negative attitudes towards vaccines, it is important to inform society based on the results of reliable scientific research, to follow transparent policies that will reduce the doubts in people's minds, and to maintain effective communication policies.","Bozkurt, V.; Arli, N.

"COVID-19 Across Social Sciences Literature: A Co-Word Study","Besides the concerns about medical, health, and mental health issues as the essential parts of research on COVID-19, social sciences, and humanities research also have been affected by the situation. In this sense, the primary purpose of the current study was to map the conceptual structure of COVID-19 literature in the social sciences area. About 2587 documents related to ""COVID-19"" in the social sciences which indexed in the Scopus database during 2020 were considered as the research data. Based on the cohesion measure, the co-word network of COVID-19 literature in the social sciences area was cohesive. The main themes raised in the research clusters were: Environmental issues, social quality service, crisis management, social support, and COVID-19 social effects. Research results revealed that emerging thematic clusters contain topics such as climate change, environment, vulnerable populations, culture, and quality of life, fake new, and social identity. In addition, the present study also predicted that at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, its social effects on societies could be consistent: thus, it is recommended that research on COVID-19 effects in the area of social sciences in universities and research institutions should be reconsidered.","Baji, F.; Jowkar, T.","https://doi.org/10.5530/jscires.11.1.13","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Scientometric Research; 11(1):125-129, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34054,""
"Factors associated with anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey: A comparison of youths and adults","Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and their possible associated factors among youths, comparing to their older adult counterparts. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional online study assessed 1493 participants in Turkey. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were used. Results: The Youths (15-24 years) reported to experience more anxiety and PTSS than Adults (25-59 years). There were weak correlations between BAI, PCL-5 scores and duration of recovery and isolation in Adults infected with corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19), but not in Youths. Younger age and lower economic status were common factors for severe anxiety and PTSS, additionally history of mental health needs and loss of an acquaintance due to COVID-19 were specific predictors for anxiety, and having a medical condition was predictor for PTSS in Youths. In Adults, female, lower economic status, having a medical condition, history of mental health needs, and loss of an acquaintance due to COVID-19 were common factors for worsening both PTSS and anxiety, additionally younger age for PISS and being infected by COVID-19 for anxiety were specific predictors. Conclusion: Pandemic might have a greater impact on mental well-being of youths than adults. Identification of risk factors can shed light on planning, prevention and intervention strategies.","Poyraz Findik, O.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with special healthcare needs","Background: Though not primarily affected by severe disease due to Sars-CoV-2-infection, emerging evidence suggests that children and adolescents are particularly impacted by the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as school closures and reduced or delayed access to healthcare services. Surveys conducted in several countries at different times during the pandemic point towards a rising mental health burden in children and adolescents. Children with special health care needs are a particularly vulnerable group in this context. They rely on a wide range of services, which were mostly suspended during the first and subsequent waves of the pandemic. We aim (1) to describe the perceived pandemic burden and psychosocial outcomes in families with children with and without special health care needs;(2) to assess the impact of socioeconomic status (SES), disease complexity and psychosocial burden on parent-reported child mental health problems. Methods: We conducted a sequential cross-sectional online survey among caregivers of children aged 1 - 18 years, the first round from August 11th - October 5th 2020 (n = 1619) and the second round from April 2nd - July 31st 2021 (n = 521). Participants were recruited through the Kindernetzwerk e. V., a patient organization for families of children with chronic diseases and disabilities;through promoting the link on free access websites;and via social und public media. Both families with and without children with special healthcare needs were encouraged to participate. We performed descriptive statistics, simple and hierarchical logistic regression to explore the association between SES and psychological outcome measures, disease complexity and general burden related to COVID-19. Results: A majority of parents felt burdened by the pandemic. Almost half reported an increase in family conflict or insufficient social support. There was a high prevalence of parent-reported mental health problems in children (1st survey: 57.4%;2nd survey: 66.7%) and of a positive screening score for depression in parents (1st survey: 30.9%;2nd survey: 72.5%). Parent-reported mental health problems were more likely to affect children from a low SES, children with complex chronic disease and those whose parents screened positive for depression. Conclusion: The study highlights inequalities in parent-reported child mental health outcomes by SES and disease complexity at two time points in a large sample of German families with and without children with special health care needs. It shows a high burden of both child and parental mental health problems in the study population and identifies children from low SES with complex chronic disease as a particularly vulnerable group concerning the impact of the pandemic on their mental health outcomes. Long-term policies, which put children at the center, aim at reducing health inequalities, and mitigate the unequal impact of the pandemic, should be an integral part of the COVID- 19-response.","Geweniger, A.; Langer, T.; Haddad, A.; Barth, M.; Shrabon, I.; Mund, A.; HÃ¶gl, H.","https://doi.org/10.5414/NHX02238","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nieren- und Hochdruckkrankheiten; 51(4):134, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34056,""
"Anxiety and Its Associated Factors Among School-aged Adolescents in East Jakarta, Indonesia during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be a significant psychological stressor which is associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: To determine adolescent anxiety prevalence and associated risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was performed from February to April 2021 at SMPN 9, East Jakarta, on 304 adolescents. The subjects were examined using sociodemographic form and self-report measures of anxiety, COVID-19 knowledge, and physical activity. The statistical significance level was set at p <U+02C2> 0.05. RESULTS: Median age was 14 years (range 12â€“16) and prevalence of anxiety 19.4%. Multivariable logistic regression findings: gender (adjusted odd ratio [aOR] = 2.50;95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26â€“4.98;p = 0.009), physical activity (aOR = 2.16;95% CI = 1.15â€“4.06;p = 0.017;), knowledge level of COVID-19 (aOR = 1.81;95% CI = 0.99â€“3.32;p = 0.053);age (aOR = 0.53;95% CI = 0.19â€“1.46;p = 0.218);education (aOR = 0.96;95% CI = 0.35â€“2.64;p = 0.932). Gender and physical activity were significantly associated with risk of adolescent anxiety. CONCLUSION: Inactive physical activity status increases the risk of adolescent anxiety. Governmental regulations are needed on the planning and implementation of a health education program for increasing physical activity among adolescents to improve physical and mental health. As a follow-up to this study, there is a need for conducting a study to determine changes in prevalence rates of adolescent anxiety during as well as after the pandemic and its associated risk factors with a better design study.","Akbar, U.

"Evaluation of the menstrual cycle of female infected with SARS-CoV-2 in women aged 36 to 45 years in iranian society","Introduction: The menstrual cycle's effects on illness susceptibility, development, and severity of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection are poorly understood. It is estimated that more than a third of regularly menstruating women developed irregular cycles during the pandemic, with associated depression, anxiety, and stress. Another study indicates that among patients with confirmed COVID-19, a quarter have altered bleeding. Methods: The results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) tests and symptoms in two women infected with SARSCoV2 are described in this paper. Results: After being discharged from the hospital, the first patient experienced a fever on the first day of her menstrual period and again on the first day of her following menstrual period. The findings of the RTPCR test were positive during the first menstrual period before to admission, then went negative during hospitalization, and then were positive again during the second menstrual period following release. After being released from the hospital, another woman experienced a fever on the first day of her monthly period. Before admission and during hospitalization, the RTPCR test was negative, but it became positive during the first menstrual period after discharge. Conclusions: According to the cases, SARSCoV2 infection may be aided by sex hormones. The menstrual status of women who have been exposed to SARSCoV2 should be assessed as part of the care procedure.","Miryousefiata, F.; Arjmandi, R.

A retrospective chart review of adolescents (11-17 years) visited in the ED of the San Paolo University Hospital in Milan for a mental disorder between January 2019 and December 2020 was conducted. We extracted and analysed sociodemographic data, information about the ED visit, the mental disorder that led to the visit, and the outcome of the visit. An anonymous code was assigned to each subject. <U+25BA>Results. The overall number of ED visits decreased from 4,330 to 2,678 (-38%), and those for mental disorders from 242 to 203 (-16%). An increase in the proportion of the total number of visits was observed, from 5,6 to 7,6% (<U+03C7>2M-H=11,0, p=0,001). No significant differences across years were recorded in the distribution of the accesses by the urgency code at the triage and by mental disorders. A significantly lower percentage of patients (39 vs 54%, p=0,003) received a psychotropic drug (administered or prescribed) in the ED in 2020. There were no differences in the hospitalization rate (21.9 in 2019 versus 23.6% in 2020). <U+25BA>Conclusions. During the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic a surge in the prevalence of ED visits associated with mental disorders was observed. This may be related to the impact of the pandemic, and the restrictive measures implemented, on mental health in the developing age.","Zanini, A.; Clavenna, A.; Canevini, M.

"Psychological distress and changes in routine during quarantine: interviews with students living in Milan","<U+25B8>Background. The Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in governments implementing disease containment measures such as school closures, social distancing, and home quarantine. To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children's mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the Covid-19 quarantine. <U+25B8>Methods. This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. <U+25B8>Results. Almost 30% of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28% of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents' bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78%) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms;43.9% of the students reported significant mood symptoms. <U+25B8>Conclusions. Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the Covid-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children's development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.","Segre, G.; Scarpellini, F.; Campi, R.; Zanetti, M.; Cartabia, M.; Clavenna, A.; Bonati, M.","https://doi.org/10.1707/3618.35987","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ricerca e Pratica; 37(3):101-111, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34062,""

"Impacts of the psychological stress response on aggression in adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has exerted a tremendous impact on the psyche of people around the world, especially adolescents. In order to provide a valuable theoretical basis for effective measures to prevent psychological problems in adolescents during public health emergencies in the future, this study examined the mediating effect of coping style (CS, including positive coping style (PCS) and negative coping style (NCS)) and the moderating effect of emotional management ability (EMA) on the relationship between the psychological stress response (PSR) and aggression (AGG) in adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. The Buss-Warren Aggression Questionnaire, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Emotion Management Questionnaire were employed to investigate the mental health of Chinese adolescents from April 10-20 (Time point 1, T1) and May 20-30 (Time point 2, T2), 2020. A total of 1,931 adolescents (aged 10-25 years, M = 19.18 years, 51.4% male) were examined at T1 and 334 adolescents (aged 11-25 years, M = 19.97 years, 48.7% male) were reinvestigated at T2. Overall, 17.6% of the participants at T1 and 16.8% at T2 reported obvious PSR activation. NCS partly mediated the relationship between the PSR and AGG, and the indirect effect was moderated by EMA reported at T2. There were regional differences in the moderated mediation model in low-risk areas at T1. The moderated effects of EMA at T1 and T2 were opposite. Specifically, high EMA resulted in a stronger relationship between NCS and AGG at T1, whereas high EMA resulted in a weaker relationship between NCS and AGG at T2. Psychological reactions resulting from sudden public health events may trigger AGG in younger individuals. However, EMA may have a buffering effect on the onset of AGG. This research expands our understanding of the development of AGG in adolescents during the pandemic.","Wei, Z.; Hu, Y.; Xiao, J. Y.; Wang, R. T.; Huang, Q. C.; Peng, Z. W.; Hou, G.

"Examining The Changing Nature of Stress: Stress of Working from Home during Pandemic Crisis","The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship among social isolation, lack of facility provision, family commitment and work from home (WFH) job stress among academicians. Data were collected from 180 respondents who were academicians who worked from home during the period of movement control order (MCO) owing to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the data collected. The results show that all predictors, namely social isolation, lack of facilities provision and family commitment are statistically correlated to WFH job stress. The empirical findings provide additional insights in order to improve the understanding of the existing model of stress and practical implications for academicians, educational institutions/schools and the government in order to reduce/address WFH job stress effectively. In addition, the study seeks to enhance awareness and destigmatize the mental health issues of academicians due to the changes in the nature of the job, which is important to help them to maintain a healthy well-being during the pandemic crisis.","Shiuen, Amanda Liew Li, Chin, Wong Siew, Seong, Lim Chui, Rasdi, Roziah Mohd","https://doi.org/10.1177/09722629221104212","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vision;: 09722629221104212, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34065,""
"Can the Arts Cure Pandemic Hearts? - Cultural Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic and its Consequences for Psychological Well-Being","Cultural activities might serve as a buffer to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Frequencies of participants? cultural activities in terms of participation in digital cultural offerings or self-initiated cultural activities during the pandemic are examined, and whether prior cultural engagement and valuing of culture have an impact on this participation. It is explored whether both forms of cultural activities are directly connected with psychological well-being, namely, optimism concerning COVID-19, and whether this relationship is mediated by autonomy, relatedness and aesthetic experience. Regression and mediation analysis were calculated (N?=?398). Both cultural activities were related to increased aesthetic experience and perceived autonomy, but only participation in digital cultural offerings was connected to increased perceived relatedness. Relatedness, in turn, was connected to increased optimism. The results reflect the protective function of cultural activities on psychological well-being, demonstrating the importance of cultural life in times of adversity.","Gotthardt, Karina Aylin, Rakoczy, Katrin, Tallon, Miles, Seitz, Matthias, Frick, Ulrich","https://doi.org/10.1177/02762374221103989","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Empirical Studies of the Arts;: 02762374221103989, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34066,""

"Alone in the COVID-19 lockdown: An exploratory study","Feelings of isolation have been prevalent worldwide since March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. This has prompted increased concerns about loneliness and related mental health problems. During the first UK COVID-19 lockdown, 71 participants were asked to share their high and low point stories from lockdown. These were analyzed using thematic analysis to explore how ?aloneness? was experienced at this time. A deductive analyses supported three key facets of aloneness reported in the literature: emotional loneliness, social loneliness, and existential loneliness, as well as a more positive form of aloneness, solitude. An inductive analysis identified risk and protective factors for loneliness, comprising worry, lockdown changes, and poor mental health;and social contact, emotional contact, stability and simple life. The study highlights the importance of understanding how facets of aloneness interrelate, and how understanding risk and protective factors can help us to develop social and policy interventions to alleviate loneliness. In particular, solitude is proposed as a potential mechanism for alleviating loneliness, particularly existential loneliness, alongside more common social methods.","Leary, Rowena, Asbury, Kathryn","https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12317","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34068,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health and career anxiety of hospitality and tourism students in the UK","Purpose - The current study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and career perspectives of the future workforce of the tourism and hospitality industry in the UK. The paper is based on theories of emotion and focuses on the interplay role of three factors of fear of COVID-19, depression, and future career anxiety. Design/methodology/approach - The current research uses a mixed-method approach in two studies to answer the research questions. First, an online questionnaire was distributed among 197 current tourism and hospitality students in the UK. In the second phase through a qualitative approach and 17 semi-structured interviews, a more in-depth approach was taken to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the future career perspectives of the respondents. Findings - Findings reveal a high level of mental health disorders among respondents. The majority of respondents suffer from some sort of mental health conditions/disorders that affect their moods, thinking, and behaviors. The results further show that the fear of COVID-19 causes depression which results in career anxiety. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the future tourism workforce in the UK is likely to suffer from some sort of mental health disorder that can influence their performances in the workplace. Companies are advised to make adjustments that help to protect the well-being and psychological health of their staff. Originality/value - Previous studies used a snapshot in time only with a focus on the immediate and short-term effects of the pandemic. In the current study, by taking a long-term impact approach, the authors attempted to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 on the future workforce of the tourism industry in the UK and offered practical implications for stakeholders.","Rahimi, R.; Akgunduz, Y.; Bilgihan, A.","https://doi.org/10.1108/jhti-05-2021-0129","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Insights;: 20, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34069,""

"Trainee Perspectives on Internship and Fellowship Training Experiences in Pediatric Health Service Psychology during a Global Pandemic","The impact of COVID-19 on the psychology training community has included modifications to internship and postdoctoral fellowship training programs to assure the safety of patients, trainees, and staff. Studies assessing the impact of COVID-19 on training in health service psychology are emerging;however, few studies have provided the opportunity for psychology trainees to candidly report about their experiences during the ongoing pandemic. This paper aims to describe how the pandemic effected internship and fellowship training experiences from the traineeâ€™s perspective. Participants included 58 trainees from pediatric psychology internship and postdoctoral fellowship programs in the United States. A survey containing open- and close-ended questions was distributed to trainees via their training directors to assess training experiences during COVID-19. Qualitative analysis of responses revealed four themes describing 1) reduced depth and breadth of training opportunities, 2) social isolation and limited professional and personal support, 3) increased use of telepsychology and reduced in-person training, and 4) increased levels of stress and burnout combined with decreased morale. Many internship trainees described pandemic-related challenges to completion of dissertation, and postdoctoral fellows experienced altered or delayed professional trajectories due to financial, mental health, and career readiness factors. Implications and future directions include the need for increased support both professionally and personally for trainees who are completing internship and postdoctoral fellowship training in the midst of COVID-19.","Gilchrest, C.; Srnka, K.; Gardner, L.; Frye, W.

"The impact of COVID-19 upon student radiographers and clinical training in Latin America","(249) Introduction This study aimed to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon radiography education across Latin American countries. Methods A survey containing 20 questions was circulated to radiography students, across 13 universities in 11 countries of Latin America using Google Forms. The survey contained open and closed questions. Answers were analysed with descriptive statistics and the methodology of interpretative phenomenological analysis for the open answers. Results Of the 1,310 responses only 23.9% (n=313) of students reported attending clinical placements and from this cohort only 8.9% (n=28) became infected with COVID-19. In response to how the pandemic had impacted upon the studentsâ€™ academic progression, the most common topic in the open answers was â€œConcerns about the lack of clinical trainingâ€, mentioned by 629 students. Students in middle and later years of their radiography education expressed the greatest concern about future clinical placements. Almost all radiography students (95.2%/n=1,247) indicated that their main concerns regarding COVID-19 infection while undertaking clinical placements was in relation to the risk of infecting their families as most students stated they cohabited with relatives (86.6%/n=1,134). Conclusion Compared to European findings co-habitation trends increased anxiety related to infection and impacted their mental health. Students expressed concern about the quality of education they were receiving during the pandemic and access to resources to facilitate on-line learning was inadequate. Socio-economic and internet connectivity factors specific to Latin America were identified and these issues need to be addressed if on-line education is required in the future.","SolÃ­s-Barquero, Sergio M.; RodrÃ­guez Valerio, MarÃ­a Paula, McNulty, Jonathan P.; Riquelme Contreras, Patricio F.; RÃ­os, Javier, GonzÃ¡lez, Heydy, Olmedo Raza, Norman Baldelmir, Ezquerra, Victor Hugo, Rainford, Louise A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2022.06.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Radiography;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34075,""

"Qualitative fingerprinting of psychoactive pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, and related human metabolites in wastewater: a year-long study from Riga, Latvia","The COVID-19 pandemic has become an unprecedented public health emergency causing immense societal and socio-economic consequences. Multiple studies have outlined that interventions to curb the spread of the virus are likely to have an effect on substance use patterns. In this study, we explored the presence of psychoactive pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and related human metabolites in 24-h composite wastewater samples that were collected weekly in 2021 from the central WWTP of Riga, Latvia. The analysis was performed via suspect screening approach using three separate high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) workflows, which relied on reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and direct infusion HRMS. In total, 39 out of 149 substances were detected throughout the sampling period. These include pharmaceuticals (mainly antiepileptics, antidepressants and antipsychotics), illicit drugs (e.g., MDMA, MDEA, cocaine, etc.) and new psychoactive substances (alpha-PVP). The results were evaluated in relation to COVID-19 incidence rate and the severity of containment and closure policies. For some compounds we observed temporal changes that may be potentially linked to the state of the pandemic. For instance, higher detection rates were observed for several illicit drugs during periods, when restrictions on public events were relaxed. Meanwhile, some psychoactive pharmaceuticals and drugs used to treat upper respiratory tract infections displayed increased prevalence in weeks when the national COVID-19 incidence rates were higher. However, without baseline reference data from previous years, it is difficult to discern how much of the relationships seen are linked to pandemic progression and seasonal variability.","Perkons, Ingus, Ikkere, Laura Elina, Sukajeva, Veronika, Neilands, Romans, Kokina, Kristina, Pugajeva, Iveta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2022.108110","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering;: 108110, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34077,""
"Opioid overdoses increase at home during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order period in Cook County, Illinois","Introduction Stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased population mobility to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. We empirically tested the hypothesis that public health measure was associated with a higher likelihood of opioid- and stimulant-involved deaths occurring in homes located in Cook County, Illinois. Methods The stay-at-home period was March 21, 2020 to May 30, 2020. We analyzed overdose data from the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office using a death location description from case investigations categorized as home, medical, motel, scene and other. Two groups of decedents were defined as either having an opioid or stimulant listed in the primary cause of death field. We modeled a weekly time series in order to detect changes in deaths (number) and trends during segmented time periods. Chi-square or Fisher's exact and adjusted logistic regression was used for testing differences between the stay-at-home and a 13-week preceding period. Results There were 4,169 and 2,012 opioid- and stimulant-involved deaths, respectively, from 2018 to 2020. People in both groups were demographically similar: 75% male, 52% white, 45 years old (mean). In the 13 weeks prior to stay-at-home orders, 51% of opioid-involved deaths occurred in homes, which increased to 59% (p&lt;0.0001) during the 10 weeks of the order and decreased back to 51% in the 18 weeks after the order expired. For stimulant-involved deaths, 51% were residential immediately before the orders;with a non-significant increase to 52% during stay-at-home. Prior to the pandemic, there were 20 deaths/week, increasing to 37 deaths/week (p&lt;0.0001) during stay-at-home enactment. Deaths involving fentanyl among the opioid-involved group increased from 76% to 89% whereas heroin decreased from 55% to 37%. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for opioid-involved fatal overdoses occurring at home during this period compared to the 13 weeks prior was 1.37 (95% CI:1.05-1.79). Conclusions The likelihood of a death occurring at home especially for people using opioids increased during the stay-at-home order period. Findings have implications for mitigating overdose risks during social isolation.","Delcher, Chris, Harris, Daniel R.; Anthony, Nicholas, Mir, Mojde","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.focus.2022.100007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: AJPM Focus;: 100007, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34078,""
"Durable functional limitation in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 admitted to intensive care and the effect of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose anticoagulation on functional outcomes","Introduction Patients affected with severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer from a wide range of sequelae, from limited airway diseases to multiple organ failure. These sequelae may create exercise limitation, impair the daily activity and thus impact the mental health and the social life. However, the extent of functional limitations and depressive symptoms are understudied especially in patients with COVID-19 after intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization. . Methods The Intermediate versus Standard-dose Prophylactic anticoagulation In cRitically-ill pATIents with COVID-19: An opeN label randomized controlled trial (INSPIRATION) was a clinical trial that randomized ICU patients with COVID-19 to intermediate-dose vs standard-dose anticoagulation. In the current study, we assessed the interval change in 30-day and 90-day functional limitations based on the post-COVID-19 functional status scale (PCFS) and depressive symptoms based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) in the trial participants. We also assessed the effect of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation on the functional outcomes and depressive symptoms. Results Of 600 randomized patients in INSPIRATION, 375 (age: 62 years;42% women) participated in the functional status study. 195 patients died during the 90-day follow up (191 by day 30). Among survivors, between day 30 and day 90, the proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe functional limitation (PCSF grade 3-or-4) decreased from 20.0% to 4.8% (P &lt;0.001) and PHQ-2 =3 decreased from 25.5% to 16.6% (P= 0.05). The proportion of patients with no functional limitations (PCFS grade 0) increased (4.2% to 15.4%, P&lt;0.001). Intermediate-dose compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation did not impact the 90-day proportion of patients with PCFS grade 3-or-4 (5.3% vs 4.2%;odds ratio (OR), 1.20, [95% CI, 0.46-3.11];P=0.80) or PHQ-2=3 (17.9% vs 15.3%;OR, 1.14, [95% CI, 0.79-1.65];P=0.14), with similar results when accounting for study center. Conclusion In patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, functional limitations and depressive symptoms were common at 30-day follow-up and had some improvement by 90-day follow-up among survivors. Intermediate-dose compared to standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation did not improve functional outcomes.","Sadeghipour, Bikdeli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2022.06.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Internal Medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34079,""
"The prediabetes and gestational diabetes management: the role of lifestyle medicine in pre and post pregnancy outcomes","Background: In the women, between 24-45 y.o., during last decade, are increased the cases of undiagnosed prediabetes conditions and the gestational diabetes, lifestyle related. The diabetes education and management of related chronic conditions, in preconception and in early pregnancy, improve the quality of women's fertility and the health before and during pregnancy, and in early life. Aim: The program considered an early counselling, about antenal care, family risks of diabetes, nutritional support, obesity and weight management, hormonal balance, mental health conditions and involved the patients in a personalised solution for prevent the diabetes during pregnancy or manage the GDM and neonatal outcomes. Method: In 2018-2021 â€œFUTURA PROJECTâ€ involved 440 women, divided after survey, into three groups: group 1 of 180 women with suspected prediabetes and hypertension, unhealthy lifestyle (smoke, inactivity, irregular sleep), fertility problems, group 2 of 140 women without chronic and pre diabetes conditions, but with stress, and unbalanced diet and group 3 of 120 women in pregnancy, with blood pressure problems and prenatal diabetes and GDM conditions. The program helped women in their reproductive health, with personalised program that reveals the reversible conditions of many chronic disorders due to bad lifestyle, and often undiagnosed. Particularly the diagnosis of prediabetes during preconceptional time and during early weeks of pregnancy, are often associated with hypertension and vascular risks, insulin resistance, undiagnosed genetic predisposition, weight disorders. The first part of program based on the division of three groups, after survey. The second part based on the personalised nutrition: the Mediterranean diet, with fibers, antioxidants, good fats, introducing the healthy foods with anti-inflammatory properties, and personalised physical activities planning and healthy habits management. The daily telemedicine check controls the evolution of the program. Results: The 3 groups are improved the personal lifestyle, with important results. In the group 1, after 6 months, the improvement of weight and physical activities increased the possibility of conceptions without complications, with reduction of insulin resistance, PCOS problem and oocytes' quality, and risks of endocrine disruptors. In the group 2 the health education and balanced heathy diet improved the hormonal problems, and undernutrition with hypovitaminosis (vit B group, vit. D, minerals), fundamental for the conception and early phases of fetal development. In the group 3 the management of chronic conditions improved a quality of prenatal health and the consequences of diabetes during and after pregnancy, for the mother and for the fetus, reduced risks of preeclampsia, birth defects, IUGR, hypertension, hyperglycemia post-partum, overweight during early life of children and risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes type 2 during next 5 years in the mothers. The monitoring with telemedicine support helped or follow up and counselling during COVID-19 emergency. Discussion: The early diagnosis of prediabetes type 2 and gestational diabetes in women, with almost three risks factors as antenatal care history, overweight or obesity, fertility problems, PCOS, hypertension, unhealthy lifestyle, improve the quality of management of diabetes and its consequences in women's health, aged 24-45, and improve the women's health outcomes after birth and early life metabolic consequences.","Hugonin-Rao, B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2022.109758","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice; 186, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34080,""
"18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain PET/CT as the only diagnostic tool able to identify early cognitive impairment in a covid-19 patient: a case-report","Background-Aim: Cognitive impairment may represent a long lasting symptom after COVID-19 resolution and FDG brain PET is useful to evaluate if brain metabolic changes are transient or long lasting. Hypometabolism was shown in many brain areas, i.e. cingulate cortex, bilateral gyrus rectus, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellar vermis. Methods: We report the case of a 62 years old man with type 2 diabetes, affected by COVID-19 infection in October 2020. After resolution, the patient had short-term memory loss and speech deficit affecting daily living and working activities and referred to the Gerontology and Geriatrics Institute (Univ. of Perugia). Neurological examination and neuropsychological tests were carried out and no alterations were found. In October 2021, the neurological examination was still normal, as well as neuropsychological tests. Brain MRI showed only two small chronic ischemic foci without bi-hemispheric white matter clinically significant abnormalities. In November 2021, the patient underwent FDG brain PET/CT (discovery ST, G.E.) according to standard protocols and images were evaluated both qualitatively and semiquantitatively. Results: An area of moderate significant hypometabolism was identified in the precuneus (predominant on the right side) and others multiple small and mild hypometabolic regions were localized in bilateral pre-frontal cortex, sensorimotor and parietal cortex both on left hemisphere. PET and MRI fusion images (Syngo.via VB10B image processing software, Siemens) showed that hypometabolic areas corresponded to structurally intact parenchyma at MRI. In January 2022 clinical and neuropsychological follow up did not evidence cognitive impairment, although the patient still felt depressed and impaired in memory, attention and daily living activities. Conclusions: In this case, FDG brain PET/CT was the only diagnostic procedure showing findings consistent with patient symptoms. In particular, precuneus hypometabolism may represent in this patient an early hallmark of dementia (i.e. Alzheimer's disease-AD), although other characteristic brain areas are not significantly impaired (i.e. cingulate cortex). In this case, FDG brain PET use, during follow up, could be crucial to evaluate if the metabolic changes may evolve into a chronic state, thus supporting mild cognitive impairment clinical suspect due to AD or confirming a stable COVID related neuronal damage. Furthermore, a second normal FDG brain PET/CT scan may suggest a post-acute infection transient phase, preluding to normal functional status. In conclusion, FDG brain PET/CT may represent an important diagnostic tool in modifying subsequent diagnostic assessment suggesting or routinely clinical follow up or other investigations for dementia (i.e. amyloid PET, amyloid and Tau protein liquor measurement). In our study, fused PET and MRI images were used, although hybrid PET/MRI system could be the choice option if available.","Rondini, M.; Lazzarato, A.; Saetta, D.; Travaglini, E.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Hyperhidrosis Patients in the Mental Health and Quality of Life: A Web-Based Surveillance Study","Background: We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the degree of depression among hyperhidrosis patients and their quality of life. Methods: 222 patients were contacted through an online questionnaire. Patients reported quality of life (QoL), including treatment and changes in symptoms during the pandemic, and also responded to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to evaluate the severity of depression. Those were compared with the result from the general population. Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression were performed to identify the factors related to the PHQ-9 score. Results: Half of the patients were female. The mean PHQ-9 score (5.25) of hyperhidrosis patients was higher than the general population, and female patients displayed significantly higher PHQ-9 scores than males (p = 0.002). QoL was impaired more in females. About 10% of patients experienced worsening symptoms, and 30% had difficulties getting appropriate management. Significant negative correlations were found between the PHQ-9 and age or disease duration. Predictive factors for the PHQ-9 were female (p = 0.006) and facial hyperhidrosis (p = 0.024). Conclusions: The level of depression among hyperhidrosis patients was higher than the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic;female and facial hyperhidrosis patients need much more psychiatric attention. Though hyperhidrosis is classified as benign and often neglected by clinicians, we need to give more awareness to the mental burden imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Woo, Wongi, Oh, Jooyoung, Kim, Bong Jun, Won, Jongeun, Moon, Duk Hwan, Lee, Sungsoo","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Hyperhidrosis+Patients+in+the+Mental+Health+and+Quality+of+Life:+A+Web-Based+Surveillance+Study","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(13):3576, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34082,""
"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOWEL DYSFUNCTION AND BOWELRELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IMPAIRMENT OVER TIME","Purpose/Background: Bowel dysfunction following rectal cancer surgery changes with time and patients adapt to symptoms. The impact of bowel dysfunction on quality of life (QOL) over time is uncertain. Hypothesis/Aim: To evaluate the change in QOL due to bowel dysfunction over time. Methods/Interventions: A prospective database starting in July 2017 of adult patients who had undergone sphincter preserving rectal cancer surgery at a single university-affiliated colorectal cancer referral centre was queried. Patients were excluded if they had local recurrence, metastasis, or persistent stoma beyond 1-year follow-up. Follow-ups were arranged according to current guidelines. Main outcomes were QOL measured by the Short Form-36 survey (8 scales and 2 summary scores), bowel dysfunction was classified using the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score (no LARS, minor LARS and Major LARS), and bowel-related quality of life was evaluated using the single-item Bowel-Related Quality of Life (BQOL) survey. The SF-36 and LARS scores were collected as part of the ongoing registry. Eligible patients were then called at 3 months after their last in-person follow-up and administered the SF-36, LARS score and BQOL. Patients were also asked how they would have answered the BQOL 3-months prior. Changes in LARS and BQOL scores were noted and compared to SF-36 scores. Results/Outcome(s): Overall, 136 patients were included (75% response rate). Mean age 61.8 (+/-10.6 years), 71% male, mean distance from the anal verge was 8.7 cm (+/-4), 54% underwent neoadjuvant radiotherapy, 51% had a diverting loop ileostomy, 87% were laparoscopic, and median follow-up was 35.4 months [23.5-64.3]. There was no significant change in 3-month BQOL (96% of patients had no change, 3% improved, and 1% deteriorated. In patients who reported no change in BQOL, 54% (72/131) had no change in their LARS score, 31% (41/131) scored worse, and 27% (31/131) improved. Patients that showed improvement in their LARS score had an associated increase in their physical component summary, role emotional, role physical, physical functioning and bodily pain. Whereas patients with a deterioration of their LARS score had an associated decrease in their general health, vitality, and mental health. Interestingly, patients with no change in their LARS score reported increases in physical functioning and role emotional, but decreases in their scores for vitality and mental health (Table). Limitations: Recall bias, Covid-19, and volunteer bias. Conclusions/Discussion: Assessment of patients' bowel related QOL is complex. Improvements in bowel dysfunction appears to be associated with improved QOL. Whereas patients with worsening bowel dysfunction had an associated deterioration in QOL. Of note, BQOL scores did not change significantly over the study period. There is currently a paucity of instruments with sensitivity to detect changes specific to bowel dysfunction- related QOL.","Wang, A.; Robitaille, S.; Maalouf, M. F.; Fiore, J. F.; Feldman, L.

"Influence of regular physical exercise on the psychological state of fibromyalgia patients, with and without a co-diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome","Background. It has been demonstrated that regular physical exercise (RPE) improves the life quality of patients with fibromyalgia (FM). However, the influence of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) comorbidity on this aspect remains unknown. Objectives. To assess how CFS co-diagnosis affects the performance of RPE by FM patients and how RPE influences the psychological state of these patients with or without CFS diagnosis. Methods. In a group of FM patients, with (FM+CFS group) or without CFS (FM group), we evaluated the percentage of patients performing RPE and how it affects their psychological state and life quality with respect to a control group of women in the same age range as reference. For this purpose, scientifically validated questionnaires were used, including those assessing fear and anxiety related to COVID 19. The results were analyzed using the Student's t-test setting with a p=0.05. Results. Paradoxically, FM+CSF group presented a higher percentage of women who performed RPE, even in the same order of magnitude as the control group. RPE improved, in both groups of patients with FM, stress, and state anxiety levels. However, it only improved the state of depression and trait anxiety in the FM group. Conclusion. The performance of RPE positively affects the psychological state and life quality of fibromyalgia patients, without a strong influence on the co-diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome.","CalderÃ³n, E.

"Long-COVID, chronic fatigue and everything in between - what have we learned and where may it impact on fibromyalgia","As the COVID-19 pandemic made its gruesome initial appearance in the first months of 2020, it initially appeared as though nothing could be more distant from this acute, dramatic, life - threatening condition, treated in intensive care units and heroically combated behind personal protective equipment, than fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome treated in clinics by primary care physicians and rheumatologists. Only gradually, as the medical community became more accustomed to the manifestations and complications of COVID-19, did the more chronic aspects of the pandemic come to light with the evolving entity of LONG-COVID syndrome (1). This syndrome was initially treated by a broad spectrum of specialties including infectious disease specialists, pulmonologists, neurologists, with rheumatologists not taking a central role. As more clinical experience was accumulated however, a surprising overlap begins to emerge between LONG-COVID and conditions such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, an overlap most obvious on a clinical level to rheumatologists well acquainted with the spectrum of fibromyalgia (2). On a clinical level, LONG COVID patients most frequently suffer from fatigue, exercise intolerance, as well as cognitive impairment, all symptoms which overlap with the chronic fatigue syndrome. Sleep disturbances, abdominal complaints, anxiety /depression and myalgia are also not unusual (3). In addition, autonomic dysregulation appears to play a role in LONG COVID (4), as in fibromyalgia. Notably, symptoms typical of fibromyalgia among LONG-COVID patients appear to be particularly common among patients with a previous history of chronic pain, and patients who were actually diagnosed with fibromyalgia before contracting COVID-19 appear to be prone to get worse (5). Notably, an association between fibromyalgia / chronic fatigue and other chronic viral diseases such as EBV/CMV, HIV and viral hepatitis has been well known before the COVID-19 era, so that viral infection has traditionally been considered among the triggers responsible for instigation the syndrome (6). Another aspect of clinical importance regarding the relationship between fibromyalgia and COVID-19 relates to the effect of vaccinations. While vaccinations have previously been speculated to have a causative role in fibromyalgia, mainly based on data relating to the gulf war syndrome, the robustness of this association is not clear. In an era of significant vaccine - hesitancy which often hampers effective attempts at controlling the pandemic, clear data regarding the safety and effectivity of COVID-19 vaccinations regarding fibromyalgia is necessary. Fascinating data has emerged indicating that patients suffering from LONG - COVID may actually have low grade persistent infection, with identification of viral antigens and RNA in tissue as long as one year after initial infection (7). While the general applicability of these findings is not yet clear, they raise the provocative possibility that similar viral vectors might be identifiable in tissues of patients suffering from chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia. Last but not least, the COVID-19 pandemic, including the social distancing measures associated with it, have taken a toll on patients suffering from fibromyalgia even when not personally infected (8). Reduced access to healthcare, lockdown and lack of exercise, anxiety and isolation may all play a role and should be considered by physicians caring for fibromyalgia patients in this era.","Ablin, J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Long-COVID,+chronic+fatigue+and+everything+in+between+-+what+have+we+learned+and+where+may+it+impact+on+fibromyalgia","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology; 40(6):7, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34088,""

Data were obtained from government websites and publicly available repositories for region dynamics and key variables. Results: Between 1990 and 2020, air quality data indicated the highest rise in CO2 emissions in India (578.5 to 2441.8 million tons) (MT), Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. Greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990 to 2018, nearly tripled in India (1990.4 to 3346.6 MT of CO2-equivalents), Nepal (20.6 to 54.6 MT of CO2-equivalents), and Pakistan, and doubled in Bangladesh. Methane emissions rose the highest in Pakistan (70.4 to 151 MT of CO2-equivalents), followed by Nepal (17 to 31 MT of CO2-equivalents) and India (524.8 to 669.3 MT of CO2-equivalents). Nitrous oxide nearly doubled in Bangladesh (16.5 to 29.3 MT of CO2-equivalents), India (141.6 to 256.9 MT of CO2-equivalents), Nepal (17 to 31 MT of CO2-equivalents), and more than doubled in Pakistan (27 to 61 MT of CO2-equivalents). On noting particulate matter 2,5 annual exposure, India saw the highest rise from 81.3 &micro;g/m3 (in 1990) to 90.9 &micro;g/m3 (2017), whereas trends were steady in Pakistan (60.34 to 58.3 &micro;g/m3). The highest rise was noted in Nepal (87.6 to 99.7 &micro;g/m3) until 2017. During the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic, the pre-and post-pandemic changes between 2018 and 2021 indicated the highest PM2.5 concentration in Bangladesh (76.9 &micro;g/m3), followed by Pakistan (66.8 &micro;g/m3), India (58.1 &micro;g/m3), Nepal (46 &micro;g/m3) and Sri Lanka (17.4 &micro;g/m3). Overall, South Asian countries contribute to the worst air quality and sustainability trends regions worldwide. Conclusions: Air pollution is prevalent across a majority of South Asia countries. Owing to unsustainable industrial practices, pollution trends have risen to hazardous levels.

"Nirmatrelvir + ritonavir (PAXLOVID) in covid-19 For certain patients at risk of developing severe disease","A 2021 double-blind randomised trial conducted in 2246 adults with covid-19 who had been symptomatic for 5 days at most, compared a 5-day course of the combination of nirmatrelvir + ritonavir versus placebo. The patients had no signs of severe covid-19, but had at least one risk factor for developing severe disease and had not been vaccinated against covid-19. Most patients were infected with the Sars-CoV-2 Delta variant. In the month following the start of the trial, 0.8% of the patients in the nirmatrelvir group were hospitalised, versus 6% of the patients in the placebo group (p&lt;0.0001). Very little is known about nirmatrelvir's adverse effects. The nirmatrelvir + ritonavir combination is a difficult treatment to use due to the risk of many major drug interactions and the risk of overdose in patients with renal impairment. In practice, as of early 2022, given that the Omicron variant is more prevalent than the Delta variant and less likely to provoke severe covid-19, it is plausible that this combination will only be of value to patients who are unprotected by covid-19 vaccination and have several risk factors for developing severe disease. Even then, its multiple potential drug interactions will need to be carefully managed.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Nirmatrelvir+++ritonavir+(PAXLOVID)+in+covid-19+For+certain+patients+at+risk+of+developing+severe+disease","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Prescrire International; 31(238):145-148, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34090,""

"Life during lockdown: Coping strategies used by preregistration nursing students during COVID-19","To explore the coping strategies used by Australian preregistration nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic 'lockdown' period. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on preregistration nursing students, both physically and psychologically. As campuses closed and online learning commenced, clinical placement access was reduced, with heightened concern about personal and family safety. As such, nursing students were forced to adopt coping strategies to manage their self and the environment. A descriptive qualitative study. One hundred and fifty-five preregistration nursing students enrolled at a regional Australian university completed a self-administered online survey. Overwhelmingly, student responses revealed that staying connected was the key coping strategy to ensure emotional and mental health wellbeing. Heightened vigilance in infection control measures was also evident, personally and for others. Routines, including exercise, facilitated physical and mental wellbeing. Overall, coping strategies identified by nursing students demonstrated applied resilience during the isolation period. Understanding the adaptive coping strategies used by nursing students can enable nurse academics to understand how to best provide support. This study emphasises the importance of recognising that not all students are able to adapt and 'cope' without supports in place. Future studies should investigate the longer-term impact of COVID-19 within the broader preregistration nursing experience and how this might impact nursing students' future careers.","Moxham, Fernandez, Lord, Halcomb, Middleton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2022.103388","20220711","COVID-19; Coping strategies; Nursing students; Pandemic; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34094,""
"Eating alone and weight change in community-dwelling older adults during the coronavirus pandemic: A longitudinal study","It is likely that the number of older adults who eat alone has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults who eat alone tend to experience weight fluctuations. Weight loss and underweight in older adults cause health problems. The study objective was to longitudinally investigate the association between changes in eating alone or with others and body weight status in older adults. This longitudinal cohort study was conducted in March and October 2020 in Minokamo City, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Questionnaire data for 1071 community-dwelling older adults were analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed using changes in eating alone or with others as the independent variable and body weight status as the dependent variable. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, living arrangements, educational level, diseases receiving medical treatment, cognitive status, depression, and instrumental activities of daily living. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. The average age of participants was 81.1 y (SD, 4.9 y). Individuals who reported eating alone in both surveys were more likely to report weight loss than those who reported eating with others in both surveys (adjusted model: odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.78; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04). These findings suggest that measures to prevent weight loss in older adults who eat alone are particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kubo, Noguchi, Hayashi, Tomiyama, Ochi, Hayashi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2022.111697","20220711","Body mass index; Eating together, Japan, Nutrition, Underweight, Weight loss","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34095,""

Archived records from the Accessibility Resource Center added detail on the ESA process. <b>Methods</b>: This mixed-method study included qualitative interviews (9 students prior to COVID and 4 during COVID) as well as a quantitative analysis of archived data. Thematic analysis was used to extract themes from the interviews. Archived data were analyzed for frequency of select topics. Results: Four positive themes (presence of animal, empowerment, symptom alleviation, and social catalyst) and three negative themes (housing accommodations, lack of ESA education on campus, and social consequences) were extracted from initial interview responses. Analysis of COVID interviews also revealed positive and negative themes with many similar to the pre-COVID responses but also included unique themes reflective of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Archived data revealed a substantial increase in the number of ESAs on campus, a wide range of species, and an array of complaints such as safety concerns, ESA behavior, ESA cleanliness, and ESA in unauthorized areas. <b>Conclusions</b>: Overall, the college ESA experience appears beneficial, facilitating the adjustment to college for students with mental health concerns.

"Sleep Patterns and Affect Dynamics Among College Students during COVID-19 Pandemic: An Intensive Longitudinal Study","Sleep disturbance is a transdiagnostic risk factor so prevalent among young adults it is considered a public health epidemic, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep may contribute to mental health via affect dynamics. Prior literature on contribution of sleep to affect is largely based on correlational studies or experiments that do not generalize to the daily lives of young adults. Furthermore, the literature examining the associations between sleep variability and affect dynamics remains scant. In an ecologically valid context, using an intensive longitudinal design, we aimed to assess the daily and long-term associations between sleep patterns and affect dynamics among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. College student participants (N=20, 65% female) wore an Oura ring continuously for 3-months to measure sleep patterns, such as average and variability in total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep onset latency (SOL), resulting in 1173 unique observations. We administered a daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using a mobile health app to evaluate positive (PA) and negative affect (NA), and COVID-worry once per day. Participants with higher SOL, b= -1.09, SE=.36, p=.006, and TST, b= -.15, SE= .05, p=.008 on the prior day had lower PA the next day. Further, higher average TST across the 3-month period predicted lower average PA, b= -.36, SE= .12, p=.009. TST variability predicted higher affect variability across all affect domains. Specifically, higher variability in TST was associated higher PA variability, b=.09, SE= .03, p=.007, higher NA variability, b=.12, SE= .05, p=.03, and higher COVID-worry variability, b= .16, SE= .07, p= .04. Fluctuating sleep patterns are associated with affect dynamics at daily and long-term scales. Low PA and affect variability may be potential pathways through which sleep has implications for mental health.","Mousavi, Lai, Simon, Rivera, Yunusova, Hu, Labbaf, Jafarlou, Dutt, Jain, Rahmani, Borelli","https://doi.org/10.2196/33964","20220711","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34099,""
"Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for adolescents with type-1-diabetes: a qualitative interview study involving adolescents and parents","This study aims to investigate the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents with type-1-diabetes (T1D). We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews including adolescents with T1D (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10, 50% female, 15-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) and their parents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8, 88% mothers). The main topics addressed were experiences during confinement regarding everyday life, lifestyle behaviors, diabetes management and treatment. We applied thematic analysis to identify common patterns of meanings. Being aware of belonging to a potential COVID-19 risk group caused worries especially in parents which resulted in strict adherence to preventive measures. Information from trustworthy sources regarding the actual risk mitigated the concerns. Digital diabetes treatment was well accepted and experienced as highly usable. The pandemic situation either facilitated or hindered the transition from parental control to diabetes self-management. While some patients managed to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors as their everyday lives seemed more predictable, others had difficulties in adapting to changed daily routines resulting in increased sedentary behavior and snacking. The perceived level of stress was directly associated with blood glucose levels. In conclusion, the implementation of psychological interventions (both for adolescents with T1D and their parents) addressing mental health literacy and media literacy seems to be important to promote positive coping skills for dealing with the pandemic situation.","Zeiler, Wittek, Graf, Bozic, Nitsch, Waldherr, Karwautz, Wagner, Berger","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2022.2084358","20220711","COVID-19; Pediatric diabetes; caregivers; psychosocial impact; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34100,""

Anxiety (8.2%), depression (11.3%), post-traumatic symptoms (10.3%), and sleep disorders (26.3%) were also reported. Diffusion impairments were found in 35.4% of the patients. Abnormal chest CT scans were present in 63.5% of the patients, mainly reticulation and ground-glass opacities. Further, a persistent decline in kidney function was observed after discharge. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies of IgA, IgG, and IgM were positive in 56.4%, 96.3%, and 15.2% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression showed that disease severity, age, and sex were closely related to patient recovery.

However, existing reviews do not include studies published beyond 2020. To systematically review evidence on presentations to health services following self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comprehensive search of databases (WHO COVID-19 database; Medline; medRxiv; Scopus; PsyRxiv; SocArXiv; bioRxiv; COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, PubMed) was conducted. Studies published from 1 January 2020 to 7 September 2021 were included. Study quality was assessed with a critical appraisal tool. Fifty-one studies were included: 57% (29/51) were rated as 'low' quality, 31% (16/51) as 'moderate' and 12% (6/51) as 'high-moderate'. Most evidence (84%, 43/51) was from high-income countries. A total of 47% (24/51) of studies reported reductions in presentation frequency, including all six rated as high-moderate quality, which reported reductions of 17-56%. Settings treating higher lethality self-harm were overrepresented among studies reporting increased demand. Two of the three higher-quality studies including study observation months from 2021 reported reductions in self-harm presentations. Evidence from 2021 suggests increased numbers of presentations among adolescents, particularly girls. Sustained reductions in numbers of self-harm presentations were seen into the first half of 2021, although this evidence is based on a relatively small number of higher-quality studies. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries is lacking. Increased numbers of presentations among adolescents, particularly girls, into 2021 is concerning.

To evaluate the wellbeing and support initiatives implemented at an Australian health service during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of employees (both users and non-users) and key stakeholders. A mixed-methods design (survey, interviews and data audit) to investigate employees' and key stakeholders' perceptions, experiences and use of the wellbeing and support initiatives implemented at a large tertiary metropolitan health service in Melbourne, Australia. Ten employees participated in an interview and 907 completed a survey. The initiatives were well used and appreciated by staff. There was no significant difference in the proportion of clinical staff who had used the initiatives compared to non-clinical staff (44% versus 39%; P=0.223). Survey respondents reported the initiatives improved their mental health (n = 223, 8%), ability to cope with COVID-19 related stress and anxiety (n = 206, 79%), do their work (n = 200, 77%) and relationships with colleagues (n = 174, 67%). Staff would like many of the initiatives (with some modifications) to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Evaluation of competency-driven training for facilitators delivering a psychological intervention for children in Lebanon: a proof-of-concept study","The mounting evidence for effective delivery of psychological interventions by non-specialists in low- and middle-income settings has led to a rapid expansion of mental health and psychosocial support trainings globally. As such, there is a demand for strategies on how to train and implement these services to attain adequate quality. This study aims to evaluate the added value of a competency-driven approach to training of facilitators for a group intervention for children with severe emotional distress in Lebanon. In a controlled before and after study, 24 trainees were randomly allocated to participate in either a competency-driven training (CDT) or training-as-usual (TAU) (1 : 1) for a psychological intervention for children with severe emotional distress. We assessed the change in demonstrated competencies, using standardised role-plays, before and after the training. Measures included the 13-item Working with children-Assessment of Competencies Tool (WeACT), the 15-item ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors (ENACT) and the 6-item Group facilitation: Assessment of Competencies Tool (GroupACT). The trainer in the experimental arm used pre-training and during training competency assessment scores to make real-time adjustment to training delivery. Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, all activities were done remotely. CDT resulted in significantly better outcomes on increasing competencies on the WeACT (repeated measures analysis of variance; <i>F</i><sub>(1, 22)</sub> = 6.49, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.018) and on the GroupACT (Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> = 22, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.003), though not statistically significant on the ENACT. There is no significant between-group difference on the reduction of harmful behaviours, mainly because both forms of training appear equally successful in eliminating such behaviours. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of CDT, using standardised assessment of trainee competencies, to contribute to better training outcomes without extending the duration of training.

"The Children of Risk Communication","For the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, risk communication has been a much-needed preventive and educative action to support citizens - including children - to adopt preventive and health protective measures. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is not the only health concern at hand that has raised concerns about the health status of children and required disease-preventive strategies. Bearing in mind the mental health problems and learning losses reported during the pandemic, in this commentary, we will argue that by now, it is time to consider critically if there could be more space for positive communication and education, both alongside and as an integral part of risk communication, to help adolescents not just to survive but also to live the fullest possible life now and in the future. Otherwise, the adolescents of COVID-19 could become 'the children of risk communication' to the detriment of their health and well-being.","Paakkari, Okan","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948221110409","20220711","Adolescents; COVID-19; health promotion; prevention; risk communication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34106,""
"The role of psychological autopsy in investigating a case of atypical suicide in schizophrenia: a case report with a brief review of literature","Self-harm typically is without lethal intent. Death can occur rarely, with suicide taking on an atypical form that raises the suspicion of hetero-aggression. Our study aimed to identify the link between self-harm and suicide intent and also to outline the positive diagnosis of an atypical suicide case which has raised the suspicion of hetero-aggression. For this purpose, the psychological autopsy method should be used regularly in suicide investigation because it not only allows a positive diagnosis of suicide but can also provide a detailed picture of mental degradation and associated suicide risk factors. The case of a 26-year-old man from a rural area, found dead in the basement, at home, naked, barricaded inside, is described. The on-site investigation and a complete forensic autopsy were performed. In addition, we apply the psychological autopsy method which gathered enough information to outline the positive diagnosis of suicide. We also made a brief literature review on the suicide risk factors and the behavioral changes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in schizophrenic patients. The forensic autopsy revealed that he presented a complex craniofacial trauma as the cause of death (with scalp lacerations, frontal fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and frontal cerebral contusions) associated with torso trauma (with self-inflicted stabbed wounds) with bruises and abrasions on the limbs. The injuries that caused death were self-inflicted and ensued repeatedly hitting his head against blunt objects. Using the psychological autopsy method, we found out that he presented multiple psychiatric hospitalizations for schizophrenia for almost 10Ã‚Â years, recently with reduced compliance to treatment. We also documented two previous suicide attempts and a gradual deterioration of his mental health. We highlighted the role of the psychological autopsy (in addition to the judicial investigation and the forensic autopsy) for the diagnosis of committed suicide, for making a rigorous differential diagnosis between accident, hetero-aggression, and suicide, and also in pin-pointing the suicide risk factors.

"Lessons from the frontline: The COVID-19 pandemic emergency care experience from a human resource perspective in the Pacific region","This study explores emergency care (EC) and other frontline healthcare worker (HCW) experiences responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific region. The crisis has reinforced the crucial role well-trained, resourced, and supported EC providers play in supporting vital health systems and services in all global regions not only during 'business as usual' periods, but in times of tremendous stress and surge. Qualitative data were collected from EC providers and relevant stakeholders in three research phases in 2020 and 2021. Data on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Human Resources Building Block, adapted for the Pacific EC context, was thematically analysed. Key findings were further analysed to identify enablers and barriers to effective EC pandemic management. 116 participants from across the Pacific region participated in this study. Five themes emerged: (1) EC providers performed multiple pandemic roles; (2) Importance of authorities' valuing frontline HCWs; (3) HCW mental health and exhaustion; (4) HCW tension managing stigma, personal/professional expectations, and chronic health needs; and (5) Building health and human resource capacity. This study significantly contributes to the limited scientific literature on HCW experiences responding to COVID-19 across the Pacific. Recommendations arising out of this research align with consensus priorities and standards that were identified pre-pandemic by health stakeholders across the Pacific for enhancing EC system development. With limited HCWs available for many Pacific nations, it is imperative the dignity and welfare of local HCWs is genuinely prioritised.

"Teens, screens and quarantine; the relationship between adolescent media use and mental health prior to and during COVID-19","This study examines associations between media use and mental health for adolescents prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using two separate datasets that sampled adolescents (8th, 10th, and 12th graders) in 2018 (n = 31,825) and 2020 (n = 1,523), mental health (hopelessness and happiness), media use (time spent using a variety of media), and personal health habits (sleep) were assessed. Overall, we found that there were significant differences by year in adolescent hopelessness, with adolescents reporting less hopelessness in 2020 (during COVID-19) than in 2018 (pre COVID-19). There were notÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹practical significant differences in adolescent happiness and loneliness. Adolescents also reported getting more sleep in our 2020 sample than the 2018 sample. Adolescents in 2020 spent significantly more time watching movies and video chatting, but less time texting and on social media than adolescents in 2018.

"Relationship Between Negative Emotions and Job Burnout in Medical Staff During the Prevention and Control of the COVID-19 Epidemic: The Mediating Role of Psychological Resilience","We herein investigated the relationship between psychological status and the various emotions of medical staff during the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, the convenience sampling method was used to select medical staff members as participants, and a cross-sectional study design was implemented. The instruments included the Burnout Clinical Subtype Questionnaire (BCSQ-36), the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), the self-rated 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). In total, 876 medical staff members were selected in this study. The CD-RISC-10 was negatively correlated with all other scales (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). The hierarchical regression coefficients of the SAS and QIDS-SR16 against the BCSQ-36 mediated by the CD-RISC-10 were <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01, and the significance of the F values in all hierarchical regression equations was P &lt; 0.01 (Sobel test, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01).

"Text Messages in the Field of Mental Health: Rapid Review of the Reviews","While mental health problems constitute a worldwide concern contributing to the global rates of morbidity and mortality, conventional mental healthcare services do not meet the current needs. Text messages (TM) represent a live model that incorporates technology into health services, spanning a large number of health conditions and playing different roles that may support the current healthcare system. To examine the TM services in the field of mental health, regarding their effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and economic evaluation in different contexts of mental health diagnoses and during critical times, when provided to individuals with mental health symptoms/disorders. This rapid review was conducted through an online search in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Medline databases. The review targeted the review studies which examined online or mobile addiction and mental health services, utilizing TM services. The search was run from the inception up to September 30, 2021. Sixty review articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All reviews were published over the last decade. The results showed that people of a young age were fairly represented, and most reviews were run over substance use disorders (SUD), including Alcohol. Most reviews examined the effectiveness outcomes of the texting service, while to a lesser extent the acceptability and feasibility, among others. Texting services were reported as effective in psychotic disorders and SUD. However, the results related to depression and anxiety were mixed. Most reviews reported a considerably high risk of bias among their included studies. High satisfaction and acceptability of the texting services were reported for patients with various mental health conditions, including those with severe mental illness. This rapid review highlighted the applications, usability, benefits, and satisfaction with the TM in the field of mental health. For a higher quality of evidence, future studies should consider TM interventions in the contexts with mixed results or a dearth of literature, and during critical times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy- and decision-makers, therefore, need to further support text-based services with guided investments in interventions that were evidenced to be accepted, economic and feasible.","Shalaby, Adu, El Gindi, Agyapong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.921982","20220711","e-mental health; mental health gap; mobile health; rapid review; text messages","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34111,""
"Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic in Argentinian Population: Vaccination Is Associated With a Decrease in Depressive Symptoms","Since the irruption of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) the planet has submerged in a time of concern and uncertainty, with a direct impact on people's mental health. Moreover, the recurrent outbreaks that periodically harry different regions of the world constantly refocus people's concerns to the pandemic. Yet, each new wave heats the diverse countries in different situations, including the advances in their vaccination campaigns. In this research, we studied the levels of the general anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression in the Argentine population across the first and second waves of infections that occurred in our country. We conducted an on-line survey, within each peak of the pandemic. People were asked to self-report GAD and depression symptoms using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questioners, inform their vaccination status, the frequency they performed physical activity as well as working condition and modality. Here, we identified the more vulnerable groups and evaluated factors that could mitigate the rise of these mental disorders, focusing on vaccination. Our data shows that reported GAD and depression levels were higher during the second wave than during the first one. More importantly, vaccinated people were less depressed than non-vaccinated people, while GAD levels remained equivalent in both groups. Other factors directly associated with lower GAD and depression levels were performing frequent physical activity and being employed, regardless of the employment modality. These observations were replicated in different age ranges and genders. This work evidences GAD and depression in different pandemic waves in Argentina, as well the factors that may contribute to reducing the magnitude of these disorders, including vaccination.","Benedetti, Barbuzza, Moscato, Reppucci, Goyeneche, Katche, Medina, Viola, Ballarini, Moncada","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.832352","20220711","COVID-19; GAD-7; PHQ-9; physical activity; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34112,""
"Utilization and Acceptability of Formal and Informal Support for Adolescents Following Self-Harm Before and During the First COVID-19 Lockdown: Results From a Large-Scale English Schools Survey","Little is known about the perceived acceptability and usefulness of supports that adolescents have accessed following self-harm, especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. To examine the utilization and acceptability of formal, informal, and online support accessed by adolescents following self-harm before and during the pandemic. Cross-sectional survey (OxWell) of 10,560 secondary school students aged 12-18 years in the south of England. Information on self-harm, support(s) accessed after self-harm, and satisfaction with support received were obtained <i>via</i> a structured, self-report questionnaire. No tests for significance were conducted. 1,457 (12.5%) students reported having ever self-harmed and 789 (6.7%) reported self-harming during the first national lockdown. Informal sources of support were accessed by the greatest proportion of respondents (friends: 35.9%; parents: 25.0%). Formal sources of support were accessed by considerably fewer respondents (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services: 12.1%; psychologist/ psychiatrist: 10.2%; general practitioner: 7.4%). Online support was accessed by 8.6% of respondents, and 38.3% reported accessing no support at all. Informal sources of support were rated as most helpful, followed by formal sources, and online support. Of the respondents who sought no support, 11.3% reported this as being helpful. More than a third of secondary school students in this sample did not seek any help following self-harm. The majority of those not seeking help did not find this to be a helpful way of coping. Further work needs to determine effective ways of overcoming barriers to help-seeking among adolescents who self-harm and improving perceived helpfulness of the supports accessed.","Geulayov, Borschmann, Mansfield, Hawton, Moran, Fazel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.881248","20220711","Self-harm; adolescence; help-seeking; mental health; school; self-injury; self-poisoning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34113,""
"Mental Health Survey of Social Entrepreneurs During COVID-19: A Study From Pakistan","COVID-19 is widely considered one of the worst pandemics in history, resulting in worldwide lockdowns, social isolation, unemployment, and economic recession. With the prolongation of COVID-19, numerous people experience stress, depression, and other mental health challenges. Recently, several studies have been documented in the literature on mental health issues among students (related to medical or other fields), teachers, medical personnel, and nurses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, social entrepreneurs (SEs) have received insufficient attention. This study aims to conduct an online survey in Pakistan's five major cities to investigate more about the mental health status of social entrepreneurs. An online survey which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) was employed to collect data. The data analyses were carried out employing descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and multiple regression analyses. A total of 840 social entrepreneurs from Pakistan participated in the survey. Among these, 366 (43.6%) were female and 474 (56.4%) were male. The findings revealed that 709 (84%) social entrepreneurs were suffering from depression symptoms, and 600 (80%) were suffering from anxiety symptoms. The majority of social entrepreneurs with depression (<i>N</i> = 546) and anxiety (<i>N</i> = 567) had mild and moderate stages. In addition, optional open-ended questions were asked from SE participants that help to understand their perception and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study concluded that several SEs in major cities of Pakistan were experiencing depression and anxiety symptoms. Based on data analysis, male SEs were highly suffering from depression and anxiety than female SEs. Limited resources and changes in customers' behavior were one of the major problems that lead SEs to depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, SEs revealed that the lack of a social business execution policy is the most distressing factor for them. Therefore, a local government must take rigorous precautionary measures to prevent mental health issues among social entrepreneurs. Moreover, the Government of Pakistan needs to adopt supportive policies to assist social entrepreneurs in stressful circumstances.","Hussain, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.849085","20220711","COVID-19; economic crisis; mental health; social change; social entrepreneurship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34114,""
"Assessing Knowledge, Preventive Practices, and Depression Among Chinese International Students and Local Korean Students in South Korea During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Online Cross-Sectional Study","Depression among university students and international university students is an increasing problem globally.

The majority of both Chinese international students and local South Korean students had a good comprehension of COVID-19. Chinese international students in South Korea showed better preventive practice than local Korean students, while the proportion of moderate to severe depression of Chinese international students was relatively higher (28.07%) than that of local Korean students (22.38%). Determinants of depression of Chinese international students in South Korea were information satisfaction, likelihood of survival after infection, symptoms of a cough and feelings of discrimination, while for local Korean students were gender, educational level, family, suspected symptoms, self-assessed physical health status, COVID-19 detection, population contact history and online sources of information.

"Social Isolation, Loneliness and Health: A Descriptive Study of the Experiences of Migrant Mothers With Young Children (0-5 Years Old) at La Maison Bleue","Migrant women with young children, including asylum seekers and refugees, have multiple vulnerability factors that put them at increased risk of social isolation and loneliness, which are associated with negative health outcomes. This study explored the experiences of social isolation and loneliness among migrant mothers with children aged 0-5 years as well as their perceptions on possible health impacts. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted at La Maison Bleue, a non-profit organization providing perinatal health and social services to vulnerable women in Montreal, Canada. Recruitment and data collection occurred concurrently during the COVID-19 pandemic, between November and December 2020. Eleven women participated in individual semi-structured interviews and provided socio-demographic information. Interview data were thematically analyzed. Migrant women in this study described social isolation as the loss of family support and of their familiar social/cultural networks, and loneliness as the feelings of aloneness that stemmed from being a mother in a new country with limited support. Multiple factors contributed to women's and children's social isolation and loneliness, including migration status, socioeconomic circumstances, language barriers, and being a single mother. Women expressed that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing experiences of social isolation and loneliness. Mothers' experiences affected their emotional and mental health, while for children, it reduced their social opportunities outside the home, especially if not attending childcare. However, the extent to which mothers' experiences of social isolation and loneliness influenced the health and development of their children, was less clear. Migrant mothers' experiences of social isolation and loneliness are intricately linked to their status as migrants and mothers. Going forward, it is critical to better document pandemic and post-pandemic consequences of social isolation and loneliness on young children of migrant families. Supportive interventions for migrant mothers and their young children should not only target social isolation but should also consider mothers' feelings of loneliness and foster social connectedness and belongingness. To address social isolation and loneliness, interventions at the individual, community and policy levels are needed.","Lim, Van Hulst, Pisanu, Merry","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2022.823632","20220711","COVID-19; early childhood; loneliness; migrant mothers; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34116,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Telehealth on Antenatal Screening and Services, Including for Mental Health and Domestic Violence: An Australian Mixed-Methods Study","Australian antenatal care includes specific screening and service provision for domestic and family violence (DFV) and mental health. However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major care changes, including greatly expanded telehealth. Given difficulties in a safe assessment and management of disclosures <i>via</i> telehealth, DFV and mental health service provision might be substantially impacted. This study therefore aimed to assess COVID-19 effects on DFV and mental health screening, as well as broader service provision from the perspective of local maternity service providers. Mixed-methods study of staff surveys and interviews of staff directly involved in pregnancy care (doctors, midwives, and allied health) in three Sydney (Australia) maternity units, from October 2020 to March 2021. Surveys and interviews interrogated perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery (ensuring required services occurred), timeliness, and quality of (a) overall maternity care and (b) DFV and mental health screening and care; and also advantages and disadvantages of telehealth. Surveys were descriptively analyzed. Interviews were conducted online, recorded, and transcribed verbatim prior to thematic analysis. In total, 17 interviews were conducted and 109 survey responses were received. Breakdown of survey respondents was 67% of midwives, 21% of doctors, and 10% of allied health. Over half of survey respondents felt the pandemic had a negative effect on delivery, timeliness, and quality of overall pregnancy care, and DFV and mental health screening and management. Perceived telehealth positives included convenience for women (73%) and reducing women's travel times (69%). Negative features included no physical examination (90%), difficulty regarding non-verbal cues (84%), difficulty if interpreter required (71%), and unsure if safe to ask some questions (62%). About 50% felt telehealth should continue post-pandemic, but for &lt;25% of visits. Those perceived suitable for telehealth were low-risk and multiparous women, whereas those unsuited were high-risk pregnancy, non-English speaking, and/or mental health/psychosocial/DFV concerns. ""Change to delivery of care"" was the central interview theme, with subthemes of impact on mental health/DFV screening, telehealth (both positive and negative), staff impact (e.g., continuity of care disruption), and perceived impact on women and partners. While telehealth may have an ongoing, post-pandemic role in Australian maternity care, staff believe that this should be limited in scope, mostly for low-risk pregnancies.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate predictors of stress in college students before and during remote classes five months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted before (BRC, July-August 2020) and during remote classes (DRC, October-November 2020). The sample consisted of 177 individuals (80 in BRC, 97 in DRC). Students were asked to self-collect saliva for cortisol analysis at each moment of the study, and to fill out a form to characterize the individual and assess the chronotype (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and the stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10). There was no difference between the evaluated periods for cortisol, perceived stress or sleep quality. Predictors for cortisol levels were gender, academic semester, chronotype, sleep quality and sadness due to pandemic (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001).

"Coping with COVID-19: Testing the stress sensitization hypothesis among adults with and without a history of adverse childhood experiences","Substantial research suggests that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) disrupt neurobiology, impacting regulatory processes (i.e., emotion regulation) that may sensitize individuals to psychopathology in response to later life stressors. Given the known increase in mental health distress related to the current ongoing global pandemic, this study investigated the extent to which COVID-related stress moderates the association between emotion regulation difficulties and psychological symptom ratings among individuals with and without exposure to ACEs. Participants (<i>N</i> = 315, aged 18-48) provided self-ratings of ACEs, emotion regulation difficulties, COVID-related stress, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. The interaction between emotion regulation difficulties and COVID-related stress on psychological symptoms was examined using path analysis. Multigroup analysis was used to examine the moderating effects of ACEs. For individuals with ACEs, COVID-stress was associated positively with depression and anxiety symptoms when emotion regulation difficulties were low. Higher emotion regulation difficulties were associated with higher symptom ratings and COVID-related stress did not add a significant effect. Goal-setting difficulties, a subscale of emotion regulation difficulties, accounted for the most variance in these associations.

"The Evaluation of Physiological Index Changes and Safety Work of Female Medical Staff With Different Medical Protection Standards in the Ward of COVID-19","Effective personal protective equipment (PPE) contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. However, it is necessary to evaluate the potential risk of different medical protections in the isolation ward of COVID-19. We aimed to explore the dynamics in physiological indexes of medical staff under primary and secondary PPE in the isolation ward of COVID-19 and provide the scientific basis for determining the safe work strategy. In this study, 30 female nurses were selected to simulate medical work under the primary or secondary PPE, respectively. The oral temperature, axillary temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and blood pressure were measured and recorded every 20 min. The subjective adverse symptoms were recorded every 30 min. The blood glucose and weight of the individuals were measured and recorded before and after the trial. The results indicated that the median trial persistence time in the participants with moderate-intensity work wearing the secondary PPE (70.0 min) was much lower than that with moderate-intensity work wearing the primary PPE (180 min) and with light-intensity work wearing the primary PPE (110 min; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Importantly, the heart rate, oral/axillary temperature, and respiratory rate of physiological indexes of the participants under moderate-intensity work wearing the secondary PPE increased significantly faster than the primary PPE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while blood oxygen saturation decreased significantly faster than the primary PPE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, the proportions of subjective adverse symptoms (such as dry mouth, dizziness, palpitations, and anhelation) were much higher than primary PPE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The average sweat volume and blood glucose consumption of participants under moderate-intensity work wearing primary PPE were higher than secondary PPE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The combination of an exacerbated workload and secondary PPE worn by COVID-19 healthcare workers increases the change in physiological indicators, and in some cases the adverse symptoms, which can affect and even suspend their medical work. For any medical institution, there is room for improvement in terms of bioethics of a ""Job Well Done"" to reduce the risks of medical activities under secondary PPE.","Zhao, Zhao, Yan, Gao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.906140","20220711","COVID-19; personal protective equipment; physiological indexes; security; working hours","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34120,""
"Assessing Changes in Anxiety, Empowerment, Stigma and Wellbeing in Participants Attending an Online-Based Recovery College in Quebec During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Pre-Experimental Study","<b>Objectives:</b> The present study aims to evaluate the effect of an online Recovery College (RC) program implemented in Quebec (Canada) during the COVID-19 pandemic. From October 2020 to June 2021, 27 training groups were conducted with a total of 362 attendees. <b>Methods:</b> Outcome was evaluated using a single group repeated measure design, assessing participants prior the training (T0), after the training (T1) and at follow up (T2). 107 learners of the Quebec RC program attended three two-hour sessions agreed to participate to the research. <b>Results:</b> Overall findings show at T1 a small but statistically significant reduction of anxiety and increase in empowerment, and below threshold reduction of stigmatizing attitudes and increase of wellbeing. Conversely, the medium-term changes at follow up were non-significant for all the outcome dimension except for anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> Findings suggest that the RC online program can be considered as a potential effective strategy to support self-regulation and empowerment of individuals and to reduce anxiety in the context of crisis for the general population.","Rapisarda, Macario de Medeiros, Briand, Boivin, Monthuy-Blanc, VallÃƒÂ©e, Drolet, Vachon, Luconi","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2022.1604735","20220711","COVID 19 pandemic; anxiety; mental health and wellbeing; online-based; program evaluation; recovery; recovery college","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34121,""

"Profiling Differential Effects of 5 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors on TLRs-Dependent and -Independent IL-6 Production in Immune Cells Identifies Fluoxetine as Preferred Anti-Inflammatory Drug Candidate","Excessive proinflammatory cytokine production induced by abnormal activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, for example, by SARS-CoV-2 infection, can cause a fatal cytokine storm. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, used to treat depression, were recently reported to reduce the risk of severe disease in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of SSRIs, and which SSRI would be most suitable as an anti-inflammatory drug, remain unclear. Here, we examined the inhibitory effects of 5 FDA-approved SSRIs, paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline and escitalopram, on the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by stimulation with multiple TLR agonists in murine macrophages and dendritic cells, and on the production of cytokines induced by concanavalin A in murine lymphocytes. In J774.1 murine macrophage cells, pretreatment with SSRIs significantly suppressed IL-6 release induced by TLR3 agonist poly(I:C), TLR4 agonist LPS or TLR9 agonist CpG ODN, but did not affect IL-6 release induced by TLR7 agonists imiquimod or resiquimod. In accordance with the results obtained in J774.1 cells, pretreatment with SSRIs also suppressed IL-6 release induced by a TLR3, TLR4 or TLR9 agonist in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and peritoneal cells of C57BL/6 mice. On the other hand, interestingly, sertraline alone among the SSRIs amplified IL-6 production induced by TLR7 agonists in murine dendritic cells, though not in macrophages. Concanavalin A-induced production of IL-6 or IL-2 in murine lymphocytes was suppressed by SSRIs, suggesting that SSRIs also inhibit TLRs-independent IL-6 production. Since SSRIs suppressed both IL-6 production induced by multiple TLR agonists in macrophages or dendritic cells and TLR-independent IL-6 production in lymphocytes, they are promising candidates for treatment of patients with cytokine storm, which is mediated by overactivation of multiple TLRs in a complex manner, leading to the so-called IL-6 amplifier, an IL-6 overproduction loop. However, the 5 SSRIs examined here all showed different effects. Overall, our results suggest that fluoxetine may be the most promising candidate as an anti-inflammatory drug. An examination of the structural requirements indicated that the <i>N</i>-methyl group of fluoxetine has a critical role in the inhibition of IL-6 production.","Takenaka, Tanaka, Kitabatake, Kuramochi, Aoki, Tsukimoto","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.874375","20220711","IL-6; Toll-like receptor; concanavalin A; cytokine; dendritic cells; lymphocytes; macrophage; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34123,""
"Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Their Associations With Quality of Life in a Nationwide Sample of Psychiatrists in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected wellbeing. However, the impact on the mental health status of Chinese psychiatrists and their relationship with quality of life (QOL) has not been examined. This was a national cross-sectional survey performed between January 11 and March 15, 2021. Demographic and work-related data were collected anonymously using an online questionnaire. Common mental health symptoms and QOL were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Chinese version and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Schedule-Brief, respectively. A total of 3,783 psychiatrists completed this questionnaire. The prevalence of depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms were 26.7% (95%CI = 25.3-28.1%), 24.1% (95%CI = 22.8-25.5%), and 11.6% (95%CI = 10-12%), respectively. Moreover, 11.1% of the participants endorsed both depressive and anxious symptoms, and 8% endorsed symptoms in all three domains. Binary logistic regression showed that aged 30-39 years (OR = 1.5, <i>P</i> = 0.03), male gender (OR = 1.2, <i>P</i> = 0.04), single (OR = 1.44, <i>P</i> = 0.01), and having a negative perception of the COVID-19 on healthcare (OR = 2.34, <i>P</i> &lt;0.001) were factors associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Participants who were divorced and widowed (OR = 1.56, <i>P</i> = 0.03), worked more than 4 night shifts/month (OR = 1.33, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and/or longer working years (OR = 1.71, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and had a negative perceived impact of the COVID-19 on healthcare (OR = 2.05, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were more inclined to experience anxious symptoms. In addition, psychiatrists with high QOL scores had lower odds of experiencing depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of each of the three types of mental health symptoms was independently associated with lower QOL (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, the depression Ãƒâ€” anxious Ãƒâ€” stress interaction was significantly correlated with lower QOL (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Approximately one-fourth of psychiatrists in China experienced depressive and anxious symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and more than one-tenth reported stress. Mental health symptoms were significant contributors to lower QOL. The psychological wellbeing of psychiatrists during the pandemic requires more attention, and interventions are needed to improve the psychological wellbeing and QOL of physicians who care for individuals with mental disorders.","Li, Xia, Yang, Zhang, Zhang, Liu, Liu, Kaslow, Jiang, Tang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.881408","20220711","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; psychiatrists; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34124,""
"Using Humor to Promote Social Distancing on Tiktok During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many humorous videos on how to practice social distancing appeared on social media. However, the effect of using humor as a crisis communication strategy to persuade people to conform to social distancing rules is not known. Drawing on the literature on humorous message framing and crisis communication, this research explores the effectiveness of a humorous message in communicating social distancing rules in two crisis severity phases (low vs. high severity) and also evaluates how humor affects individuals' online and offline engagement intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2 (message framing: humorous vs. non-humorous) x 2 (crisis severity phase: low vs. high) between-subjects design experiment was conducted to test the research questions during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in China from January 30 to February 2, 2020. The results showed that the severity of the phase of a health crisis can significantly affect stakeholders' online and offline responses toward the disease. More specifically, in a low severity phase, humor led to increased source likability for the message, and more online and offline engagement intentions. However, no differences between a humorous and non-humorous message in perceived risk were observed. Whereas, in a high severity crisis phase, humor reduced individuals' offline engagement intentions and a decrease in perceived risk, no significant difference was found between a humorous and non-humorous message on source likeability. Humor can motivate both more online engagement and offline protective action intention when the crisis severity phase is low, while when crisis severity soars, a non-humorous message should be more desirable. More specifically, using humor in communicating information about an infectious disease can enhance the spokesperson's likeability in a low severity phase, and also helps to spread health information to a larger audience. While, the negative side of using humor in communicating an infectious disease appears in severe crisis phases, as it then decreased the public's perception of risk, and triggers less protective actions. Going beyond previous research, this study recognized that crisis severity changes in different phases of the spread of infectious disease, thereby providing actionable strategy selections for crisis practitioners in a dynamic communication environment.","Xiao, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.887744","20220711","COVID-19; RAMS; health communication; humor; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34125,""

"Need for cognitive closure and trust towards government predicting pandemic behavior and mental health: comparing United States and China","Residents of the United States and China have responded very differently to the implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures. This study introduces the uncertainty reduction theory and the need for cognitive closure (NFC) framework into the context of a public health crisis and compares models across the United States and China. Specifically, we collected survey data to examine how NFC, trust in government, and attitudes toward preventive measures predicted pandemic compliance behaviors, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction among 745 college students (399 from China and 346 from the United States). Chinese participants trusted their government more, believed COVID preventive measures to be more beneficial, and reported more pandemic compliance and fewer depressive symptoms than U.S. Trust in government and attitudes towards preventive measures mediated the relationships between NFC and pandemic compliance behaviors among Chinese participants but not U.S. NFC predicted better mental health outcomes among participants in China compared to U.S. Trust in government mediated NFC and mental health outcomes among Chinese participants. Trust in government predicted better mental health (fewer depressive symptoms and more life satisfaction) in both the United States and China. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings for promoting mental health and pandemic compliance behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Wang, Tang, Zhen, Wang, Zhang, Cheong, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03327-0","20220711","COVID-19 behavior; Culture; Mental health; Need for cognitive closure; Trust in government","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34127,""
"Adjustment to the COVID-19 pandemic: associations with global and situational meaning","COVID-19 has created pervasive upheaval and uncertainty in communities around the world. This investigation evaluated associations between discrete dimensions of personal meaning and psychological adjustment to the pandemic among community residents in a southern US state. In this cross-sectional study, 544 respondents were assessed during a period of reopening but accelerating infection rates. Validated measures were used to evaluate theoretically distinct dimensions of perceived global meaning (Meaning-in-Life Questionnaire) and pandemic-specific meaning (Meaning in Illness Scale). Adjustment outcomes included perceived stress, pandemic-related helplessness, and acceptance of the pandemic. In multivariate models that controlled for demographic and pandemic-related factors, stronger attained global meaning (i.e., perceptions that life is generally meaningful) and attained situational meaning (i.e., perceptions that the pandemic experience was comprehensible) were related to better adjustment on all three outcomes (all <i>p</i>'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In contrast, seeking situational meaning (i.e., ongoing efforts to find coherence in the situation) was associated with poorer adjustment on all indices (all <i>p</i>'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001).

"Internet Addiction in Socio-Demographic, Academic, and Psychological Profile of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Czech Republic and Slovakia","Internet addiction is a serious problem among young adults that requires increased attention, especially at a time of distance learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between internet addiction and selected socio-demographic, study-related, and psychological characteristics of college students. Internet addiction was measured using the Internet Addiction Test both overall and in its individual subscales (Salience, Excessive Use, Neglect Work, Anticipation, Lack of Control, and Neglect Social Life). The selected characteristics represented (1) socio-demographic profile (gender, age, residence, family), (2) academic profile (housing during the semester, form of study), and (3) psychological profile (depressive symptoms-the Patient Health Questionnaire, stress-the Perceived Stress Scale, anxiety symptoms-the Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Data collection took place during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 at Czech and Slovak colleges, with 1,422 students from the Czech Republic and 1,677 students from Slovakia participating in the research. The analytical processes were carried out through descriptive analysis, non-parametric difference analysis, and multiple negative binomial regression. Mild internet addiction was found in 387 (27.2%) Czech and 452 (27.0%) Slovak students. Moderate internet addiction was identified in 49 (3.4%) students from the Czech Republic and in 100 (6.0%) students from Slovakia. Two (0.1%) Czech and three (0.2%) Slovak students reported severe internet addiction. Increased likelihood of internet addiction overall, as well as in most individual subscales, was found particularly among male students and students who lived away from home during the semester. Depressive symptoms and stress could also be considered significant predictors in both countries. These results are important for the development of effective strategies and prevention programs, as Internet addiction may be a serious problem in the future, given the current times. When assessing internet addiction among college students, it would also be appropriate to evaluate the individual internet addiction subscales and their specifics.","Gavurova, Ivankova, Rigelsky, Mudarri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.944085","20220711","anxiety symptoms; depressive symptoms; mental health; problematic internet use; relationships; socio-demographic characteristics; stress; study-related characteristics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34129,""
"Burnout syndrome in Nova Scotia dental hygienists during the COVID-19 pandemic: Maslach Burnout Inventory","Burnout syndrome is the result of prolonged occupational stress. The syndrome has 3 dimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced personal accomplishment (PA). This study aimed to examine the prevalence of the 3 dimensions of burnout in dental hygienists in Nova Scotia, Canada, (N = 745) as they returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic following a furlough; to explore the effect of burnout during COVID-19 on dental hygienists' professional lives; and to determine the tools and methods that dental hygienists use to overcome burnout. In this cross-sectional study, participants were asked to complete an anonymous survey inclusive of demographic information, employment characteristics, the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI-HSS [MP]), and 2 open-ended questions. The response rate was 34.9% (n = 260). Approximately one-third (36.2%) of respondents met the criteria for burnout. Contributors to burnout were time, providing dental hygiene care, expectations of dentists, physical and mental health, lack of autonomy, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported mechanisms to overcome occupational stress centred on work-life balance, social support networks, working in a positive environment, and physical activity. This study took place during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced the rate of burnout among dental hygienists, particularly within the EE domain where scores were twice as high as those reported in pre-COVID-19 studies. Dental hygienists may be at risk for burnout. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of burnout and implementing healthy behaviours may reduce its detrimental effects.

"Multimorbidity worsened anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","Multimorbidity is a global health issue impacting the quality of life of all ages. Multimorbidity with a mental disorder is little studied and is likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a survey of 14,007 respondents living in Brazil to investigate whether people who already had at least one chronic medical condition had more depression and anxiety symptoms during social distancing in 2020. Generalized linear models and structural equation modelling were used to estimate the effects. A 19Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% and 15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% increase in depressive symptoms were found in females and males, respectively, for each unit of increase in the observed value of reported chronic disease. Older subjects presented fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. There was a 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% increase in anxiety symptoms in females for each unit increase in the reported chronic disease variable and a 14Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% increase in males. Younger subjects were more affected by anxiety symptoms in a dose-response fashion. High income was significantly related to fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms in both males and females. Physical activity was significantly associated with fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Structural equation modelling confirmed these results and provided further insight into the hypothesised paths.","Castro-de-Araujo, da Silva Rodrigues, Machado, Henriques, Verotti, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Duarte-Salles, Kanaan, Barreto, Lewis, Barbosa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.07.005","20220710","Anxiety; Chronic diseases; Covid-19; Depression; Epidemiology; Mental disorders; Pandemic; Physical exercises","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34131,""

Helmsley Charitable Trust funded a project to establish and implement an ED-based telepsychiatry service for patients with mental health issues in underserved areas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of this novel ED-based telepsychiatry service. This was a mixed-methods study evaluating the new ED-based telepsychiatry consult service implemented in five EDs across three rural states that participated within a mature hub-and-spoke telemedicine network between June 2019 and December 2020. Quantitative evaluation in this study included characteristics of the telehealth encounters and the patient population for whom this service was used. For qualitative assessments, we identified key themes from interviews with key informants at the ED spokes to assess overall facilitators, barriers, and impact. Integrating the quantitative and qualitative findings, we explored emergent phenomena and identified insights to provide a comprehensive perspective of the implementation process. There were 4130 encounters for 3932 patients from the EDs during the evaluation period. Approximately 54% of encounters involved female patients. The majority of patients seen were white (51%) or Native American (44%) reflecting the population of the communities where the EDs were located. Among the indications for the telepsychiatry consult, the most frequently identified were depression (28%), suicide/self-harm (17%), and schizophrenia (12%). Across sites, 99% of clinician-to-clinician consults were by phone, and 99% of clinical assessments/evaluations were by video. The distribution of encounters varied by the day of the week and the time of day. Facilitators for the service included increasing need, a supportive infrastructure, a straightforward process, familiarity with telemedicine, and a collaborative relationship. Barriers identified by respondents at the sites included the lack of clarity of process and technical limitations. The themes emerging from the impact of the telepsychiatry consultation in the ED included workforce improvement, care improvement, patient satisfaction, cost-benefit, facilitating COVID care, and access improvement. Implementation of a telepsychiatry service in ED settings may be beneficial to the patient, local ED, and the underserved community. In this study, we found that implementing this service alleviated the burden of care during the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced local site capability, and improved local ability to provide quality and effective care.","Vakkalanka, Nataliansyah, Merchant, Mack, Parsons, Mohr, Ward","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2022.06.053","20220712","Emergency service, hospital; Psychiatry; Qualitative; Research; Rural health services; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34132,""
"What about mental health after one year of COVID-19 pandemic? A comparison with the initial peak","A psychiatric epidemic has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic and specific vulnerable populations have been identified. We aimed to explore the presence of anxiety, acute stress and depression among these vulnerable groups after a year of pandemic and relate them to our previous results obtained with the same methodology during the initial peak of the pandemic in Spain. A total of 2182 participants conducted a national survey, starting on March 2021. Sociodemographic information and clinical symptoms were assessed. The sample was divided into four groups in order to develop four substudies with these results: 1) Healthcare workers presented lower anxiety, acute stress, and depression than non-Healthcare workers (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), being nurses the most affected. 2) People with mental disorders experienced higher anxiety, acute stress, and depression than people without (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), as well as a higher rate of COVID cases (14% vs. 9.3%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.041). 3) People Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years old presented lower anxiety and acute stress than people &lt;60, (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) and a weaker depressive syndrome (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003). 4) Males presented lower anxiety, acute stress and depression than females (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). According to the results obtained during the initial peak, Healthcare workers have developed efficient coping strategies, while elders have managed to maintain their previously emotional balance. Notwithstanding, women and people with mental disorders continue to be vulnerable to emotional distress after a year of pandemic. Women and people with mental disorders continue to be especially vulnerable to emotional distress after a year of pandemic.","GarcÃƒÂ­a-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Romero-Ferreiro, RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Alvarez-Mon, Lahera, Rodriguez-Jimenez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.07.010","20220712","COVID-19; Elderly; Gender differences; Healthcare workers; Mental disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34133,""
"Lower levels of glutathione in the anterior cingulate cortex associate with depressive symptoms and white matter hyperintensities in COVID-19 survivors","SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that mainly affects the respiratory system. However, clinical manifestations such as neurological symptoms, psychopathological outcomes and brain alterations suggest brain involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depressive symptoms and cerebral white matter hypodensities/hyperintensities (WMH) have been widely reported in COVID-19 survivors and have been shown to persist after recovery from infection. At the same time viral Infections, including COVID-19, have been shown to lead to oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is the main antioxidant in the brain and reduced GSH levels have been implicated both in COVID-19 and depression. We therefore hypothesise that reduced GSH levels may be associated with depressive symptoms and WMH in COVID-19 survivors. Forty-nine participants (age 18-70) surviving COVID-19 underwent magnetic resonance imaging to measure WMH and brain GSH levels in the ACC, blood sampling to measure systemic inflammation and psychopathological assessment for depressive symptoms. ACC concentrations of GSH inversely associated with both depression scores and the number and volume of WMH. The volume of WMH also positively associated with depressive symptomatology. Finally, systemic inflammation negatively predicted GSH concentration in ACC. In conclusion, we observed overlapping associations of GSH levels in ACC, WMH and severity of depression in COVID-19 survivors, and confirmed the central role of systemic inflammation, thus warranting interest for further study of oxidative stress and antioxidants in the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.","Poletti, Paolini, Mazza, Palladini, Furlan, Querini, Benedetti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2022.06.008","20220710","COVID-19; Depression; GSH; SARS-COV-2; Spectroscopy; White matter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34134,""
"Investigating the influence of shift work rosters on stress measured as cortisol in hair during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the workload and has affected physical and mental health of many employees. Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) has proven useful as a marker for retrospective assessment of stress in epidemiological studies and was measured here in non-healthcare night-shift workers with standard shifts (8-h shifts) and extended shifts (12-h shifts) before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Results showed a twofold increase in HCC among shift workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with previous measurements. Subjectively reported measures of psychosomatic stress were not found to be reliable predictors of HCC. No statistically significant HCC differences were found between rosters. Working 12-h shifts does not appear to be an additional stressor in the already demanding COVID-19 pandemic.","Casjens, Tisch, Brenscheidt, Beermann, BrÃƒÂ¼ning, Behrens, Rabstein","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.105858","20220712","Biomarkers; Extended shift length; Rotational shift work; SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; Shift work schedules","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34135,""

"Research With Refugees and Vulnerable Populations in a Post-COVID World: Challenges and Opportunities","At the Stress, Trauma and Anxiety Research Clinic (STARC) at Wayne State University in Detroit, we are currently amid data collection for a longitudinal prospective study of Syrian refugee children and their parents. Funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, our goal is to understand the impact of exposure to war trauma and the stress of migration on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, as well as the neurobiological, epigenetic, and environmental correlates of risk and resilience. Like many research groups around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic brought our work to a screeching halt. Researchers who, like us, were engaged in human subjects research were left grappling with the question of how to continue their work while ensuring the safety of both research staff and participants, and while maintaining scientific integrity. In March 2020, our institution halted all in-person human subjects research that did not have direct benefits to participants, which continued until October, when research activity was resumed subject to implementation of modified procedures. Over the past 2 years, we have pivoted, adapted, and flexed, ultimately making changes that have allowed us to continue successful data collection throughout the pandemic. This article will discuss the specific challenges of working with ethnically minoritized and immigrant populations during the pandemic, the adaptations that we implemented to enable safe and effective data collection, as well as the new knowledge that we can apply to future research protocols.","Saad, George, Bazzi, Gorski, Abou-Rass, Shoukfeh, Javanbakht","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2022.04.024","20220710","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34143,""
"[Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Emergencies During the Second Wave of the SARS-CoV2-19 Pandemic: Findings from the TÃƒÂ¼bingen University Hospital]","Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Emergencies During the Second Wave of the SARS-CoV2-19 Pandemic: Findings from the TÃƒÂ¼bingen University Hospital <b>Abstract.</b> <i>Objective:</i> Child and adolescent psychiatric emergencies during the SARS-CoV2-19 pandemic are part of a controversial discussion. This study investigates the volume of such emergencies, the age of the patients, and the diagnoses of eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) that occurred at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Center (CAP) TÃƒÂ¼bingen during the second wave of the pandemic compared to the year before. <i>Methods:</i> We evaluated data on all emergencies at CAP TÃƒÂ¼bingen (telephone calls, outpatients, patient admissions) from 10/2019-01/2020 (first time period) and 10/2020-01/2021 (second wave). <i>Results:</i> The volume of emergencies during the second wave (319 presentations) was 29.7 % higher than during the first time period, and the number of patients (172 presentations) increased by 10.3 %. Compared to the first time period, the number of inpatients was 27.9 % higher, and the emergency admissions increased by 27.8 %. Patients in the second wave were somewhat older, with an average age of 14.8 years (first period: 14.2 years). Eating disorders were more frequent during the second wave, whereas OCD were more frequent in the first time period. <i>Conclusions:</i> Almost 30 % more emergencies were recorded in the second wave of the pandemic, with especially eating disorders increasing. Systematic emergency records should be documented at all German CAPs to enable demand-oriented planning. <b>Zusammenfassung.</b> <i>Fragestellung:</i> Kinder- und jugendpsychiatrische NotfÃƒÂ¤lle wÃƒÂ¤hrend der SARS-CoV2-19-Pandemie werden kontrovers diskutiert. In dieser Studie wird an der KJPPP TÃƒÂ¼bingen untersucht, inwiefern sich das Notfallaufkommen in der zweiten Welle im Vorjahresvergleich verÃƒÂ¤ndert hat. Dabei werden die Anzahl der NotfÃƒÂ¤lle, die Altersstruktur sowie die Diagnosen der EssstÃƒÂ¶rungen und ZwangsstÃƒÂ¶rungen ausgewertet. <i>Methodik:</i> Daten zu allen an der KJPPP TÃƒÂ¼bingen bestehenden Notfallkontakten (Telefonate, ambulante Vorstellungen, Notaufnahmen) wurden fÃƒÂ¼r die ZeitrÃƒÂ¤ume 10/2019Ã¢â‚¬â€œ01/2020 sowie 10/2020Ã¢â‚¬â€œ01/2021 (zweite Welle) untersucht. <i>Ergebnisse:</i> Das Notfallaufkommen war im zweiten Zeitraum mit 319 Vorstellungen um 29.7 %, die reine Patient_innenenanzahl mit 172 Patient_innen um 10.3 % hÃƒÂ¶her als im Vorjahr. StationÃƒÂ¤re Notaufnahmen sind um 27.8 % gestiegen. Die Patient_innenzahl der stationÃƒÂ¤ren Notaufnahmen war 27.9 % hÃƒÂ¶her. Das Patient_innenklientel war im zweiten Zeitraum mit durchschnittlich 14.8 Jahren etwas ÃƒÂ¤lter (erster Zeitraum: 14.2 Jahre). Das Notfallaufkommen der jÃƒÂ¼ngsten Patient_innen (<b>Ã¢â€°Â¤</b> 12.99 Jahre) war im zweiten Zeitraum geringer. EssstÃƒÂ¶rungsdiagnosen finden sich im zweiten, Zwangserkrankungen hingegen im ersten Zeitraum hÃƒÂ¤ufiger. <i>Schlussfolgerungen:</i> Eine knapp 30 %-ige Steigerung des Notfallaufkommens zum Zeitpunkt der zweiten Welle der SARS-CoV2-19-Pandemie lÃƒÂ¤sst sich in der KJPPP TÃƒÂ¼bingen feststellen. Insbesondere fÃƒÂ¼r EssstÃƒÂ¶rungen zeigt sich ein deutlicher Anstieg.

"Information-seeking, mental health and loneliness: Longitudinal analyses of adults in the UK COVID-19 Mental Health & Wellbeing study","Background As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, a huge amount of information has been shared to keep people informed about health-related and other topics. While information-seeking has generally been seen as an adaptive response to the pandemic, it can result in negative outcomes including on mental health. The present study reports longitudinal data from the UK COVID-19 Mental Health and Wellbeing study and tests whether reporting COVID-related information-seeking is associated with subsequently poorer mental health outcomes. Method A quota-based sampling methodology was used in order to recruit a nationally representative sample. COVID-related information-seeking was assessed via questionnaire at six waves between March and November 2020 along with symptoms of depression, anxiety, mental wellbeing and loneliness (N = 1939). Hierarchical linear modelling was used to assess the relationship between COVID-related information-seeking and mental health and loneliness scores. Results Information-seeking was found to reduce over time. Overall, women, older and higher socioeconomic group individuals reported higher levels of information-seeking. At waves 1-4 (March-June 2020) the majority of participants reported that they sought information on Covid 1-5 times per day, this decreased to less than once per day in waves 5 and 6 (July-November 2020). Higher levels of information-seeking were associated with poorer mental health outcomes, particularly clinically significant levels of anxiety and poor wellbeing. Conclusion A high-level of information-seeking behaviour was associated with poorer mental health outcomes, particularly symptoms of anxiety. Reducing or managing information-seeking behaviour may be one method to reduce anxiety during pandemics and other public health crises.","Sarah Wilding et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E017B-AA1-230","20220711","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34145,""
"Maternal depression, childhood resting-state brain connectivity, and adolescent depression during the COVID-19 outbreak","Adolescents of mothers with a history of depression are at two-to-five-fold increased risk for developing depression themselves. These adolescents may be especially vulnerable to depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. To better understand the complex vulnerability processes involved in the transmission of maternal depression risk to adolescent offspring in the context of the pandemic-related stress, we examined potential mediating and moderating factors that link maternal depression history and offspring depressive symptoms, including resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and mothersâ€™ depressive symptoms, in 85 adolescents during the pandemic. Adolescentsâ€™ pre-pandemic rs-FC between posterior and anterior cingulate cortex (PCC-ACC) moderated the association between maternal depression history and adolescentsâ€™ depressive symptoms during the pandemic, such that maternal depression history predicted adolescentsâ€™ symptoms only in youths with heightened pre-pandemic PCC-ACC rs-FC. Mothersâ€™ depressive symptoms during pandemic mediated and moderated the link between maternal depression history and adolescentsâ€™ depressive symptoms; specifically, mothers with a history of depression had greater depressive symptoms during pandemic outbreak, which were, in turn, associated with offspring depressive symptoms. Additionally, maternal depression history predicted depressive symptoms in adolescents whose mothers had relatively lower depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Findings speak to the complex mediating and moderating processes involved in the transmission of maternal depression risk to adolescent offspring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pan Liu et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0180-15F-EDA","20220711","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Clinical Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Developmental Neuroscience","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","",34146,""
