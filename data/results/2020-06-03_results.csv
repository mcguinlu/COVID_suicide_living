"Preventing prejudice by preserving the spirit of mental health legislation during the COVID-19 national emergency","The COVID-19 national emergency activates legislative powers that allow a proportional infringement upon individual liberties. We canvas the complex legal landscape governing mental health consumers in this climate, highlight ethical considerations in application of the law and offer a simple algorithm to navigate this space. In times of emergency, it is crucial that we uphold the safeguards embodied within mental health legislation to prevent prejudicial treatment of mental health consumers.","Ouliaris, Sheahan, George","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220928865","20200602","human rights; mental health legislation; national emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-03","",1540,""
"Could COVID-19 improve psychiatric awareness at the heart of the Middle East? - A personal reflection on Bahrain's response","This perspective offers a personal insight into COVID-19 in Bahrain along with the response to this unprecented pandemic. In a country where a robust health care system and economic prosperity have allowed it to cope with the medical sequelae, the mental health consequences may have been less anticipated but more problematic. An unforeseen positive emerging from the pandemic might be the nation's recognition of the importance of mental health wellbeing and a new openness to discussing it.","Maher Negm","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.74","20200602","Bahrain; COVID-19; Coronavirus; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-03","",1541,""
