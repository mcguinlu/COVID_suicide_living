"Measurement of the extent of Anxiety and Depression that has occurred in college students due to the COVID 19 pandemic: An Survey based cross-sectional study","OVERVIEW: The ongoing Pandemic because of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused all the educational institutes including colleges to be closed for a very long time. As a result the students are compelled to remain in their homes for this time. Prolonged stay at home along with excess use of social media and other modes to kill the time are quite famous to cause certain health issues in a person, specially the teenagers and adolescents. Mental wellbegin, being a dimension of health as per WHO should not be ignored at all specially in these situations. METHOD OF STUDY: A Online Questionnaire is prepared based of the ZUNG Self Rating Anxiety and Self Rating Depression Scale (Pre-validated Scales). The Form is circulated digitally among the people and then we have collected the data in excel. Based on the result we have prepared our statistical chart RESULT: Quite a significant number of candidates were suffering due to the pandemic situation. 17.091% were suffering from mild to moderate anxiety, 1.785% had marked to severe anxiety levels, (Constituting approximately 18.9% of the total). On the other hand, 8.673% of the students had mild depression, while 1 candidate (0.255%) had moderate depression and 1 (0.255%) had severe depression, (Constituting approximately 9.20% of the total). We found that candidates in the age group of 23-24 years had the maximum prevalence of depression. It was followed by candidates with ages between 21-22 years. We found that the candidates with age between 23 to 24 years were having highest prevalence of significant anxiety levels which is closely followed by candidates having age which lies between 22 years to 23 years.","Shubham Goswami; Soujanya Chakraborty; Aritra Chakraborty","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.18.21268026","20211219","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24002,""
"Experience from a level-1 major trauma centre in England of trauma epidemiology after easing of lockdown restrictions","Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic transformed trauma care. We examined the effect of lockdown easing on trauma presentation and management. Method: Data was retrospectively analysed from Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) on patients presenting to one Major Trauma Centre in the East of England with trauma. The first 47 days of lockdown (23rd March-9th May 2020, period 1) were compared with the next (10th May- 26th June 2020, period 2) and last 47 (27th June- 13th August 2020, period 3). Data collected included demographics, mechanism and severity of injury, management, and length of stay. Results: 1,249 patients were included;62.2% were male with a mean age of 57.73. Footfall declined in April 2020 compared with 2019 (56 vs 143) but rebounded by May (123 v 120 patients). Road traffic collisions increased over periods 1-3 (18.8% v 23% v 30.1%, p=0.038);deliberate self-harm (DSH) increased in period 2 compared with 1 and 3 (6.3% v 3.4% v 1.4%, p=0.03) respectively. The 2020 patient age was younger than 2019, with less trauma relating to alcohol (7.3% v 13.2%, p=0.009). Compared with 2019 reductions in total length of stay (14.1 v 17.4 days, p=&lt;0.001), critical care length of stay (2.3 v 2.9 days, p=0.04) and consultant driven care (54.9% v 64.9%, p&lt;0.001) were noted in lockdown. Conclusions: Our study suggests that after lockdown easing, trauma footfall rapidly rebounded to 2019 levels. This should be acknowledged in resource allocation decisions if future lockdowns are necessitated.","Waseem, S.; Romann, R.; Lenihan, J.; Rawal, J.; Carrothers, A.; Hull, P.; Chou, D.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znab259.1062","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: British Journal of Surgery; 108(SUPPL 6):vi275-vi276, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24003,""
"The effect of the CIVID-19 pandemic on mental health associated trauma, admissions and fractures at a london major trauma centre","Aim: Non-injury related factors have been extensively studied in major trauma and shown to have a significant impact on patient outcomes, with mental illness and associated medication use proven to have a negative effect on bone health and fracture healing. We report the epidemiological effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health associated Orthopaedic trauma, fractures, and admissions to our centre. Method: We collated data retrospectively from the electronic records of Orthopaedic inpatients in an 8-week non-COVID and COVID period analysing demographic data, referral and admission numbers, orthopaedic injuries, surgery performed and patient co-morbidities including psychiatric history. Results: here were 824 Orthopaedic referrals and 358 admissions (6/ day) in the non-COVID period with 38/358 (10.6%) admissions having a psychiatric diagnosis and 30/358 (8.4%) also having a fracture. This was compared to 473 referrals and 195 admissions (3/day) in the COVID period with 73/195 (37.4%) admissions having a documented psychiatric diagnosis and 47/195 (24.1%) a fracture. 22/38 (57.9%) and 52/73 (71.2%) patients were known to mental health services, respectively. Conclusions: Whilst total numbers utilising the Orthopaedic service decreased, the impact of the pandemic and lockdown disproportionately affected those with mental health problems, a group already at higher risk of poorer functional outcomes and non-union. The proportion of patients with both a fracture and a psychiatric diagnosis more than doubled and the number of patients presenting due to a traumatic suicide attempt almost tripled. It is imperative that adequate support is in place for vulnerable mental health patients, particularly as we are currently experiencing the 'second wave' of COVID-19.","Jamal, M.

"Excelling in adversity-maximising training opportunities by reducing cancelled operations","Aim: Viral swabs for Covid-19 are an essential part of a patient's preoperative checklist. Patients require negative swabs before proceeding to theatre. Delay in this process may lead to a cancelled operation with physical and mental health implications for the patient. There is a knock-on effect on surgical training, with fewer procedures and operations for teaching. Method: Previous guidance required 2 staggered swabs prior to admission. This was simplified on 19th August 2020 to a single pre-operative swab. A retrospective audit was established within the Otolaryngology department at the Royal Gwent Hospital to assess whether the simplification of guidance reduced the rate of cancellations and the number of same-day swabs needed to maintain operating. Results: In a 4-week period prior to the simplification in guidance there were 34 listed procedures, 3 of which were cancelled due to swab related issues. 1 patient required a same-day swab to facilitate surgery. In a 4-week period after the simplification in guidance there were 48 listed operations and no cancellations due to swab issues. 6 patients required same-day swabs to facilitate surgery. Conclusions: Whilst the simplification of swab guidance has improved the rate of operations cancelled, the reliance on same-day swabs to maintain operating has increased. This could reflect better availability of same-day swabs. It is in the interest of trainees to ensure that patients are fully prepared for operations pre-operatively to minimise unplanned cancellations, associated patient harm and loss of training opportunities.","Holden, C.; Warrell, D.; Addams-Williams, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znab259.090","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: British Journal of Surgery; 108(SUPPL 6):vi41, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24005,""
"Comparing the contents of the on-call ENT sho bag at a busy district general hospital to ENT UK guidelines-a quality improvement project","Aim: To compare the contents of the ENT SHO bag with the recommendations by ENT UK. To address any deficiencies in the bag and prevent it from recurring in the future. Method: Over 5 consecutive days, the night SHO would compare the contents of the ENT bag with a checklist based on ENT UK guidelines. This was repeated post-intervention. Results: The initial data collection showed that the bag was missing numerous items, ranging from tongue depressors to nasal catheters. It also contained bulky, unnecessary items such as Lahey forceps. The bag was replenished, unnecessary items removed, and a new checklist was introduced which the SHO had to complete every night shift. Any missing equipment was to be replaced at that time. PPE was added to the bag. The next round of data collection showed that the bag remained well stocked, with only minor equipment missing such as merocele packs and Sofradex drops. However, the bag contained alternatives such as Rapid Rhinos and Gentisone drops. Conclusions: The introduction of a checklist has ensured that the SHO bag remains well stocked. This improves the efficiency of on-calls as the SHO no longer has to repeatedly travel between A&E and ENT stores. This is also beneficial when dealing with emergencies as all the equipment is readily accessible. The addition of PPE was prudent as ENT is a high-risk speciality in the COVID pandemic. Currently the checklist is completed weekly, in order to reduce the workload for the SHO - something to re-audit in the future.","Sooriyamoorthy, T.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znab259.014","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: British Journal of Surgery; 108(SUPPL 6):vi23, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24006,""
"Development and implementation of the Mobility Clinic COVID-19 pandemic patient outreach program","Background: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was uncertainty if individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) were at greater risk for adverse health events. Certainly, there was great concern over direct effects (e.g. physical illness, hospitalization) but also fear of indirect effects (e.g. mental health, isolation, caregiver disruption) due to COVID-19 and the public health measures to contain it. Since individuals with SCI often have limited or tenuous access to healthcare and resources, they are at greater risk than the general population of destabilization. Objective: To proactively identify risks that may be exacerbated by the pandemic and mitigate them where possible, a primary care outreach program was developed. Methods: A screening algorithm was developed by our interdisciplinary Mobility Clinic team, and focuses on 5 domains: health destabilization, mental health, access to services and supports, social isolation, and caregiver stress. The algorithm was administered by phone to a total of 107 individuals, who were identified as past and current Mobility Clinic patients. Any risks identified received further investigation by the team. We used the opportunity to educate patients about the risks of COVID-19 and protective measures. Follow-up with patients continued every 6-8 weeks throughout the duration of the pandemic. An evaluation of this outreach program involved a description of the patient population contacted, the identification of common risks for patients, and patient satisfaction with the program. Results: The contacted patient population consisted of 76 males and 31 females. 74 patients were identified as having a spinal cord injury. Some of the most common questionnaire responses by patients with SCI included feelings of stress and/or anxiety and a reduction in Personal Support Worker services leading to increased caregiver stress. A patient satisfaction survey demonstrated that 83% of patients (n=12) were very satisfied with the phone call and the care received. Conclusion: The outreach program helps us to proactively identify risks for individuals with SCI and address any healthcare needs they have. Risk assessment and care at the primary care level can mitigate adverse events and hospitalizations, which is especially important during a pandemic situation when healthcare and hospital resources are limited.","Milligan, J.; Parikh, R.; Beuermann, L.; Labach, D.; Bauman, C.; Kuzych, L.","https://doi.org/10.1080/10790268.2021.1957653","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine; 44(SUPPL 1):S280-S281, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24007,""

"Roles and experiences of non-governmental organisations in wildfire response and recovery","Local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) play critical roles in providing immediate relief resources and long-term recovery support for communities after a disaster. Drawing on interviews with NGO representatives involved in three Northern California wildfires in 2017 and 2018, this study identifies challenges and opportunities for NGOs supporting wildfire relief and recovery. Across fires and NGOs, NGO management and wellbeing, coordination and disaster experiences emerge as common barriers and enablers of relief and recovery. In many cases, local NGOs' participation in wildfire relief and recovery included simultaneous expansion of an organisation's mission and activities and negative impacts on staff mental health. Under the rapidly evolving circumstances of relief and the prolonged burdens of recovery, personal relationships across NGOs and government agencies significantly improved coordination of assistance to communities. Finally, interviewees expressed greater confidence when responding to wildfires if they had previous experience with a disaster, although the COVID-19 pandemic presented distinct challenges on top of pre-existing long-term recovery work. Despite repeated assertions that interviewees' experiences reflected only their individual community or wildfire, key challenges and opportunities were consistent across disasters. These results may aid other NGOs in preparing to provide immediate disaster relief and long-term recovery in California and other wildfire-prone areas.","Miller, R. K.; Mach, K.

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the magnitude of mental illnesses such as depression, not only in the general population, but also in health personnel. However, in Peru the prevalence is not known and the associated factors for developing depression in health personnel are not known. Objective: To determine the prevalence and identify the factors associated with depression in health personnel, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Material and Method: An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out between the months of May-September in health establishments. A sample of 136 health workers were included and a survey was applied to collect the data. Depression as a dependent variable was measured using the Zung self-report scale. To identify the associated factors, the bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed by logistic regression with STATA v 14. Results: The prevalence of depression was 8.8% CI 95% (4.64-14.90), likewise, the antecedent of having a family member or friend died from COVID-19 with a p value of 0.017 and OR of 6.78 (CI: 1.39-32.90). On the other hand, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was found to be a protective factor against the development of depression with p value 0.003 and OR of 0.03 (CI: 0.004-0.32). Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 10 among health professionals and technicians developed depression during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in this study. In addition, the history of having relatives or friends killed by COVID-19 was negatively associated with depression and the use of PPE was identified as a protective factor for depression.","Espinoza-Ascurra, Gonzalo, Gonzales-Graus, IvÃ¡n, MelÃ©ndez-MarÃ³n, MÃ³nica, Cabrera, Rufino","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.11.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24011,""
"Attitude, preventive practice and perceived barriers among perioperative and anesthesia nurses toward surgical smoke hazards during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background Surgical smoke (SS), which is produced by the use of high-temperature devices for cutting and coagulation of tissue during surgical procedures, is considered a serious threat to the health of operating room (OR) staff due to the presence of hazardous substances and possibility of transmitting various infections such as HPV, HIV, COVID-19 and so on. This study was conducted to determine the Attitude, preventive practice and perceived barriers among perioperative and anesthesia nurses toward surgical smoke hazards. Methods In this cross-sectional descriptive study, conducted at hospitals of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (Iran) in 2021, 262 perioperative and anesthesia nurses were included by stratified random sampling. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and an SS questionnaire consisting of questions on attitude (17 item), practice (8 item), and barriers (13 item). Collected data were analyzed using SPSS16. Results The mean attitude and preventive practice scores (49.52 Â± 12.36 and 15.8 Â± 2.05, respectively) of the operating room nurses were reported at moderate and weak levels, respectively. There was a direct and significant relationship between attitude and practice scores (rÂ =Â 0.129, PÂ =Â 0.019). The main barriers to the prevention and dealing with the hazards of SS in ORs were reported in management (3.68 Â± 1.06) and equipment (3.24 Â± 0.66) dimensions, respectively. Conclusion It is recommended to adopt strategies to improve the attitude of OR staff regarding the preventive measures against surgical smoke hazards. Moreover, appropriate equipment and support of managers should be provided by explaining the policies and guidelines to prevent the complications of surgical smoke.","Lotfi, Mojgan, sheikhalipour, Zahra, Zamanzadeh, Vahid, Aghazadeh, Ahmadmirza, Khurdeforush, Hassan, Rahmani, Parvin, akhuleh, Omid Zadi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcorm.2021.100234","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Perioperative Care and Operating Room Management;: 100234, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24012,""
"The role of social support and resilience in the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers in Spain","Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 pandemic hotspots across the globe have reported mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, or sleep problems. Many studies have focused on identifying modifiable risk factors, such as being afraid of getting infected or reporting shortage of personal protective equipment, but none have explored the role of protective factors. Method This cross-sectional study used an online survey to describe the association between three potentially protective factors (self-reported resilience, self-perceived social support from colleagues at work, and self-perceived social support from relatives and friends) and three mental health outcomes, namely psychological distress, depression symptoms, and death thoughts in a large sample of Spanish HCWs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results We recruited 2372 respondents between April 26th and June 22nd, 2020. Resilience and self-perceived social support were inversely associated with mental health problems (psychological distress, depression symptoms, and death thoughts), after adjusting for potential sources of confounding. Conclusions Resilience and self-perceived social support might protect HCWs against negative mental health outcomes. Public health strategies targeting these modifiable determinants might help to reduce the impact of the pandemic on HCWsâ€™ mental health.","Ortiz-Calvo, Esther, MartÃ­nez-AlÃ©s, Gonzalo, Mediavilla, Roberto, GonzÃ¡lez-GÃ³mez, Elisabeth, FernÃ¡ndez-JimÃ©nez, Eduardo, Bravo-Ortiz, MarÃ­a-Fe, Moreno-KÃ¼stner, Berta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.12.030","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24013,""
"Prevalence and determinants of probable depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in seven countries: Longitudinal evidence from the European COvid Survey (ECOS)","Background Our aim was to present data on the prevalence of probable depression and anxiety and to determine their correlates during the COVID-19 pandemic in seven European countries using a longitudinal approach. Methods Longitudinal data (wave 4 in November 2020: n= 7,115;wave 5 in January 2021: n=7,068;wave 6 in April 2021: n=7,204) were taken from the European COvid Survey (ECOS), a representative sample of non-institutionalized inhabitants from Germany, United Kingdom, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Portugal and Italy aged 18+. Probable depression and anxiety were quantified using the established and validated PHQ-4 (2-item depression scale, PHQ-2 / 2-item anxiety scale, GAD-2). Results In wave 4 (wave 5;wave 6), 26.6% (25.5%;23.8%) of all respondents had probable depression and 25.7% (23.6%;22.1%) had probable anxiety. Prevalence rates for probable depression and probable anxiety differed significantly between countries. Among all countries and waves, particularly high prevalence rates were found among individuals aged 18 to 29 years. Longitudinal analysis showed that the likelihood of probable depression was positively associated with increasing age, great income difficulties and lower health-related quality of life. The likelihood of probable anxiety was positively associated with income difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life. Limitations Screening tool was used to quantify the outcomes. Conclusion The magnitude of probable depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in European countries was highlighted. Moreover, determining the factors associated with probable depression or anxiety (e.g., income difficulties, worse health-related quality of life) may assist in identifying individuals at increased risk.","Hajek, AndrÃ©, Sabat, Iryna, Neumann-BÃ¶hme, Sebastian, SchreyÃ¶gg, Jonas, Barros, Pedro Pita, Stargardt, Tom, KÃ¶nig, Hans-Helmut","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.029","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24014,""
"Teacher's perceptions, institutional challenges, and educational sustainability during Covid-19 in Ecuador","The Covid-19 pandemic has affected global educational systems, especially in developing countries. Therefore, governments and educational administrators have adopted contingency measures to maintain the functioning and the sustainability of their national educational systems. These measures involved the use of technologies and have enabled a significant amount of teachers to continue working with their students around the globe. This article aims to analyze the perception of Ecuadorian teachers about the contingency measures taken at the governmental and institutional levels while facing the COVID-19 crisis. Also, several aspects regarding the teachersâ€™ perceptions about their technological skills, access to electronic devices, and implications of teleworking in their mental health and performance are also analyzed. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 3,183 Ecuadorian teachers working at all levels of education. An online questionnaire which obtained a reliability of 0.84 in Cronbach's Alpha was used. The results show that despite the high levels of uncertainty, most teachers agreed with the measures that had been taken by the Government, the Ministry of Education as well as their institutions and reported feeling comfortable with teleworking. However, the lack of technological resources in rural areas and the lack of trust in the effectiveness of online classes are aspects that need to be analyzed before considering the viability of long-term online education in Ecuador.","Andrade-Vargas, Lucy, Estevao-Romeiro, Artieres, Iriarte-Solano, Margoth, Riofrio-Leiva, Vicente, Yunga, Deisi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08596","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Heliyon;: e08596, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24015,""

"Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on eating habit and mental behavior in non-professional runner vs healthy volunteers","Rationale: SARS-COV 2 pandemic has hit on our lives since early 2020. Several reports from literature showed an increase of anxiety and disordered eating habits (EA) among heterogeneous populations in study. Professional and non-professional athletes usually observe a regular EA regimen. Thus, we wanted to compare EA, mental behaviors of non-professional runners with healthy volunteers (HV), matched for sex and age, during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: we consecutively enrolled non-professional runners (NR) vs. HV via flyer advertisement. The subjects had to fulfill online EA and Scl-90 questionnaires, independently evaluated by our outpatient Nutrition Unit and Neurology Clinic specialists, respectively, of San Benedetto General Hospital. Results: We consecutively enrolled 18 non-professional runners (12 females, mean age 35.5Â±1.7 years, BMI 24.5Â±0.7 Kg/m2)), and 14 healthy controls (9 females, mean age 35.4Â±1.4 years, BMI 23.4Â±0.8 Kg/m2) on early 2021. Over- and irregular (binge) eaters were significantly represented among NR vs. healthy volunteers (p&lt;0.05). NR had higher scores for obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and sleep disturbances occurrence vs. HV (all, p&lt;0.05). These findings were correlated with over- and irregular EA. Conclusion: unexpectedly, NR athletes were significantly affected by SARS-COV 2 pandemic vs. HV in terms of EA and mental behavior impairment. These findings can be explained by the reduced physical activity of NR during pandemic.

"Material Hardship among Custodial Grandparents in COVID-19 and Its Associations with Grandchildrenâ€™s Physical and Mental Health: A Latent Class Analysis","COVID-19 has increased economic hardship for many families, including custodial grandparent-headed families. We aim to examine latent classes of material hardship among custodial grandparent-headed families, to assess predictors associated with identified classes, and to investigate associations with grandchildrenâ€™s physical and mental health outcomes during COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was administered via Qualtrics Panels in June 2020. The sample comprised of 362 grandparents. Latent class analysis and multinomial and binary logistic regression were conducted. Three latent classes of material hardship were identified: Class 1 low overall hardship with high medical hardship, class 2 moderate overall hardship with high utility hardship, and class 3 severe overall hardship. Factors, including race, household income, labor force status, years of care, and financial assistance status, were associated with class membership. Class 2 was significantly associated with grandchildrenâ€™s physical health. Our findings suggest that material hardship is heterogeneous among custodial grandparents during COVID-19, and children in households experiencing utility hardship have a higher risk for poorer physical health outcomes. Results highlight the need to meet grandparentsâ€™ material needs and call for future research to examine possible mechanisms that explain the link between material hardship and grandchildrenâ€™s outcomes.","Xu, Yanfeng, Zhao, Qianwei, Schuler, Brittany R.; Levkoff, Sue E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2021.106340","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Children and Youth Services Review;: 106340, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24018,""
"Foster care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative analysis of caregiver and professional experiences","Background Research is needed to facilitate better understanding of how different groups have been impacted by COVID-19, especially those in already strained service systems such as foster care. These inquiries will support further response, recovery and preparedness efforts. Objective This qualitative study addressed how professionals and caregivers in foster care described being affected by COVID-19 in order to support future research and planning for foster care systems in this pandemic context. Participants and setting A sample of foster parents and foster care professionals (NÂ =Â 357) from a mostly rural, southeastern state in the U.S. participated in the study. Methods Qualitative analysis was conducted of 357 open-ended responses regarding the impact of COVID-19 from a survey distributed in August 2020. Results The coding process resulted in the identification of 15 distinct themes: Isolation & Loss of Social Support, Work Changes/Stressors, School Issues, Childcare Issues, No Impact/Positive Changes, Financial Problems, Fear of Contagion, Negative Child Welfare Impacts, Mental Health Problems/Stress, Loss of Faith/Trust & Societal Frustrations, Health & Mental Healthcare Access Issues, PPE & Testing Issues, Grief & Loss, and Marital Problems. Secondary impacts rather than direct physiologic effects of the virus were primarily reported. Conclusions This study underscores the various challenges facing foster care systems, and how the pandemic context is exacerbating many of these issues. Further research is needed to ensure the implementation of adequately complex and nuanced responses that target needs and avoid creating further problems for foster care.","Whitt-Woosley, Adrienne, Sprang, Ginny, Eslinger, Jessica","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105444","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Child Abuse & Neglect;: 105444, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24019,""
"A cross sectional study on psychological impact of covid19 on post graduate doctors and Compulsory Rotatory Residential interns in COVID isolation ward of a tertiary care centre, Madurai","Background COVID-19 pandemic causes major impact on economic, physical, mental well-being of people all over the world. Doctors are working in stressful, unprepared, limited resource setting, and they are under the continuous threat of getting infection. Managing mental health of these warriors is great importance. Hence the present study to estimate the psychological impact of COVID-19* and factors associated with it among doctors in tertiary care hospital, Madurai. Methods A Cross-sectional study was conducted during Octoberâ€“November 2020 using a pre-designed semi structured questionnaire and DASS-21 scale which were sent through Google form to doctors who were in their quarantine period after the COVID duty. Totally 292 responses were received. Descriptive statistics done to find frequencies and percentages. Correlation for continuous variables;Univariate and multivariate regression for categorical variables were used to predict the factors influencing the psychological impact. Results In our study, 42.1% doctors were depressed, 43.8% were stressed and 50.7% had anxiety. Depression*, anxiety*, stress* scores were positively correlated with number of COVID duties(r2 0.163,0.138,0.133), number of elderly persons(r2 0.188,0.169,0.188) in their family and negatively correlated with sleep duration(r 2â€“0.219,-0.281,-0.239), attitude of study participants(r2-0.319,-0.274,-0.291). Multiple logistic regression showed that disturbed sleep(odd'sratioÂ =Â 3.931,2.734,3.420) and poor quality of sleep which affect the next day function(odd'sratioÂ =Â 3.470,2.968,3.122) were significant predictors for all three psychological impacts. Conclusion High prevalence of psychological impact estimated, ensures the requirement of early screening with timely psychological intervention and establishment of guideline policies to support mental health of healthcare workers* for maintaining the functionality of healthcare system.","Sridevi, P.

"Mental health symptoms, well-being and experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-methods practice-based study","The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated abrupt and substantial changes in daily life, and public health strategies intended to protect physical health can negatively affect mental health and well-being, especially for individuals with pre-existing mental health challenges. For this study, we surveyed a sample of clients (NÂ =Â 94) in the summer of 2020 from a community mental health clinic in the northeast United States. A mixed-methods, concurrent triangulation design was used to (a) identify client subgroups on indicators of mental health (i.e. anxious and depressive symptoms) and emotional, psychological, and social well-being using latent profile analysis (LPA), and (b) within these subgroups, examine qualitative, thematic patterns in self-described challenges, benefits and learning related to the pandemic. The LPA revealed five distinct subgroups with various levels of symptoms and well-being, including Stagnant (moderate symptoms/moderate well-being), Languishing (high symptoms/low well-being), Flourishing (low symptoms, high well-being), Fortitudinous (high symptoms, moderate well-being) and Mobilized (moderate symptoms, high well-being). These divergent subgroups support the need to conceptualise mental health symptoms apart from well-being and assess for heterogeneous constellations of such constructs among psychotherapy clients. Thematic analysis offered additional insight into pandemic experiences within each subgroup, including attention to psychological, emotional, behavioural/lifestyle, relational, physical and ecological/contextual dimensions of self-experience, as well as the ways clients had adjusted to the pandemic's circumstances. Findings support nuanced conceptualisations of positive mental health and offer insight into coping and adaptation during this public health crisis.","Crabtree, Sarah A.; Captari, Laura E.; Hall, Eugene L.; Sandage, Steven J.; Jankowski, Peter J.","https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12503","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Counselling and Psychotherapy Research; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24021,""
"Infodemia in the Time of Covid 19: Criminal Law and Security Aspect","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe and the world has led to a number of legal, economic, medical, security and other challenges. Given the speed with which (dis) information about SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, a new term has emerged - infodemia. Infodemia is a flood of information about the virus, and it is very difficult to distinguish the truth from falsehoods. In addition, the spread of misinformation can have multiple negative consequences, both for the health of the population, mental health in particular, and the awareness of citizens about the current global situation. At the same time, infodemia can be associated with hate speech, which ultimately leads to risky behavior. Namely, such false inscriptions consequently may lead citizens into the criminal zone by disrespecting the epidemiological measures prescribed by competent authorities, which can very easily lead to global illegal action in the form of criminal offense of spreading infectious diseases. To this end, the EU seeks to respond to such undesirable and dangerous phenomena, with concrete measures that can be implemented quickly through existing legal resources. In this paper, the authors are analyzing the problem of false news spreading from criminal law and security aspects, along with comparative solutions. Namely, Croatian criminal legislation does not criminalize the dissemination of false news as a criminal offense. In our legal system the dissemination of false news is prescribed as a misdemeanor in the Misdemeanors against Public Peace and Order Act, which originated in the former state. Following the above, the authors seek to provide answers to a number of legal and security issues. First of all, what are the legal consequences of spreading false news about SARS-CoV-2, how can rumour spreading sanctions be aggravated, where are freedom of the press restrictions, and how do false information affect national security?","Pilic, M.; Pilic, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Infodemia+in+the+Time+of+Covid+19:+Criminal+Law+and+Security+Aspect","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Policija I Sigurnost-Police and Security; 30(3):417-429, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","",24022,""
"A Group-based Online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Treatment for Depression, Anxiety Symptoms and Quality of Life in Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","This study aimed to investigate whether Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) leads to reduced anxiety and depression symptoms in health care workers during the pressure of the covid-19 pandemic. ACT has been developed to improve psychological flexibility, and it has been used on a wide range of psychological disorders. For this study, 40 health care participants had been approached psychotherapy clinics at Tabriz city during COVID-19 and were divided into two groups. One received an ACT-based treatment program, and one had no therapy in this study. All participants were administered by Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Quality of Life Index, Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II to assess at pre- and post-treatment level their ratings on such scales. Regarding the results, an ANCOVA analysis revealed a significant effect of ACT to reduce the level of depression and anxiety scores as well as an improvement in quality of life in the treatment group (p &lt;.05) compared with the control group. Based on the present study, we conclude that ACT effectively reduces anxiety and depression, and achieves an improvement on the quality of life among health workers in this study and can be applied as efficient psychological treatment.","Otared, N.; Moharrampour, N.

Long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become increasingly recognized and need and huge effort to prevent and care. Methods: We set up a 3-month follow-up of 160 patients, 82 women and 78 men, admitted in the Emergency-Medicine-CoViD from October 2020 to March 2021.The mean age was 60. Asthenia, fever, cough, myalgia, headache, anosmia, ageusia are the most common primary symptoms. Results: All the patients performed blood-test, neuroimaging, respiratory and neurological assessment.We noticed a decrease in the laboratory findings inflammatory response. The chest CT showed that 70 patients had significant pulmonary fibrosis. 80 patients had a neuropsychological consequence associated with infection, depression, sleep impairment, anxiety, loss of memory and concentration, ageusia, anosmia, headache and asthenia. Patients with pre-existent disease experienced a worsening, especially those with cognitive decline. Conclusions: Currently, as we are still experiencing the pandemic and its effects, it is too early to describe the full clinical picture of post-CoViD syndrome. We need for more long-term clinical followup data to prevent long-term sequelae and post-CoViD neurological syndromes. We need ongoing neurological cognitive and affective monitoring of all cases of CoViD-19 to formulate relevant prevention and intervention strategies.

Design and Methods: The study sample consisted of 604 healthcare workers. Data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the researcher and analysed by using descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, and Turkey test on the SPSS 23.0 software package. Findings: The healthcare professionals in the study were concerned that they could infect their family members with the virus (72%) and that their relatives would be harmed due to the pandemic (63.2%). Nurses experienced the least anxiety. Women experienced more anxiety than men. Despite experiencing anxiety, 58.5% did not consider resigning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Practice Implications: The mental health of healthcare professionals, who serve at the forefront during the Covid-19 pandemic, should be evaluated in the long term. Early intervention to indirect traumatization can make it easier to control the anxiety caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Anxiety self-rating scale, rejection sensitivity questionnaire revised death anxiety scale and brief resilience coping scale were used to collect data. Pearson Product Moment Correlation revealed positive relationship between anxiety, rejection sensitivity and fear of death. Anxiety and rejection sensitivity indicated negative relationship with resilient coping. Mediate analysis showed that anxiety significantly predicted rejection sensitivity and fear of death, rejection sensitivity significantly predicted fear of death and rejection sensitivity significantly mediated between anxiety and rejection sensitivity. Moderated-mediation analysis showed anxiety as negative predictor of death anxiety while resilient coping and rejection sensitivity are positive predictors of fear of death. Resilient coping didn't moderate between anxiety and fear of death but the indirect effects of resilient coping on low and moderate level was significant. Independent Sample T-Test revealed significant generational differences in anxiety, significant gender differences in fear of death and significant family differences in rejection sensitivity. Significant family system differences were found only on rejection sensitivity with nuclear scored high.
