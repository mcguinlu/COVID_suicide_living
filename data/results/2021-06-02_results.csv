"Anxiety and depression during pregnancy in the era of COVID-19","This study aimed to evaluate anxiety and depression in pregnant women during this global disease. This was a cross-sectional study recruiting 120 pregnant women. The study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital. We recruited women attending for antenatal care. Anxiety was evaluated using an Arabic validated Kuwait University Anxiety Scale (KUAS). Depression was evaluated using a validated Arabic form of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The study included 48 (40%) nulliparous and 72 (60%) multiparous women. The mean KUAS scores for nulliparous and multiparous women were 45.27Ã‚Â±10.78 and 47.28Ã‚Â±10.62. Both nulliparous and multiparous women had a fairly high possibility of depression<b>.</b> Fifty-three (44.2%) of them reported scoresÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â of 14. Ninety-three (77.5%) women thought that COVID-19 pandemic would affect their pregnancies. There was a significant association between the number of women reporting fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and their KUAS and EPDS scores (p-value &lt;0.001 each). COVID-19 affected the mental health of pregnant women to a great extent. Care should be directed to measures that would decrease the impact of this pandemic on vulnerable populations.","Khamees, Taha, Ali","https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2021-0181","20210601","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14206,""
"The level of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality in pregnancy during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","We aimed to evaluate the mental health and sleep quality of pregnant women in different trimesters during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and investigate the effect of quarantine and new lifestyle changes that come into our lives with pandemic with on this subject. It was conducted on pregnant women (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°149) who attended routine pregnancy prenatal visit during their pregnancy weeks. The data were collected using sociodemographic and clinical data form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to evaluate sleep quality, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to evaluate maternal depression and anxiety. A significant correlation was observed between the week of gestation and depression, anxiety, and defective sleep scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). A moderate positive correlation was found between the week of gestation and depression (r: 0.628). A high level of positive correlation was found between the week of gestation and defective sleep quality and anxiety scores (r: 0.858, r: 0.754). A statistically significant increase in depression, anxiety, and defective sleep quality was found in the group staying in home quarantine (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002). This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic can cause depression, anxiety, and serious sleep disorders in pregnant women. The depression and anxiety scores of pregnant women in home quarantine were also found to be higher than the group not in quarantine. As the week of gestation progresses, mental health symptoms worsen and sleep quality deteriorates.","Ãƒâ€¡olak, GÃƒÂ¼rlek, Ãƒâ€“nal, YÃ„Â±lmaz, Hocaoglu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14872","20210601","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pregnancy; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14207,""
"Self-isolation, psychotic symptoms and cognitive problems during the COVID-19 worldwide outbreak","The worldwide outbreak of CoronaVirus Disease appeared in 2019 (COVID-19) has forced millions of people into social isolation. Past research has documented negative psychological effects of self-isolation during health crises, in terms of stress, anger or depressive symptoms, but overall ignored psychotic symptoms and cognitive problems. The present study (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 211) examined the relationship between the conditions of self-isolation - that is, duration, living space, frequency of social interactions - and psychotic symptoms and cognitive problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of both psychotic symptoms and cognitive problems was associated with time since last conversation, with time since the person last left home and with smaller living space. Participants who reported an increase of psychotic symptoms and cognitive problems during the period of the pandemic also showed higher levels of symptoms. Although social isolation is an effective method for preventing the COVID-19 from spreading, for some individuals it is associated with an increased risk of developing psychotic symptoms.","AllÃƒÂ©, Berntsen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114015","20210601","COVID-19; Cognitive problems; Confinement; Psychotic symptoms; Self-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14208,""
"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women","The aim was to examine the psychological effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women, as well as the factors influencing these effects. The study design was cross-sectional and the participants were 200 pregnant women. The first group called the Pandemic Group (PG) included 100 women who were evaluated with psychological assessment instruments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second group titled Pre-Pandemic Group (PPG) consisted of 100 women who were evaluated prior to the pandemic. Perceived stress, prenatal concerns and psychopathological symptoms were evaluated and compared. Pandemic Group scored significantly higher than Pre-Pandemic Group in the depression dimension of the SCL-90, in the phobic anxiety dimension, and in the Perceived Stress Scale. In addition, insomnia, along with having recently suffered the loss of a loved one explained 25% of the score variance in the depression dimension of the SCL-90. Insomnia also explained 13% of the variance of the results found in the Perceived Stress Scale. The fear of contagion by COVID-19 increased the scores obtained in the phobic anxiety dimension, explaining 11% of the variance. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could produce an increase in psychopathological symptomatology and stress, which can lead to negatively affecting pregnant women's mental health.","Puertas-Gonzalez, MariÃƒÂ±o-Narvaez, Peralta-Ramirez, Romero-Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113978","20210601","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pregnancy; Prenatal stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14209,""
"Prevalence of current mental disorders before and during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of repeated nationwide cross-sectional surveys","To assess the prevalence of mental disorders during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with both, baseline and the first wave of the pandemic, and to identify disproportionally affected non-clinical subgroups. We used data from three nationally representative cross-sectional studies and compared the prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders, and alcohol-use disorders at baseline (November 2017, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3306), immediately after the first peak (May 2020, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3021), and during the second peak (November 2020, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3000) of COVID-19 in Czechia. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) as a screening instrument, and calculated weighted prevalence (%) with 95% weighted confidence intervals (95% CIs). Additionally, we examined the prevalence of these disorders across different non-clinical population sub-groups during the second wave of the pandemic. The proportion of individuals experiencing at least one mental disorder was highest during the second wave of the pandemic (32.94%, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31.14%; 34.77%), when compared to both the baseline in November 2017 (20.02%, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 18.64%; 21.39%), and the first wave in May 2020 (29.63%, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 27.9%; 31.37%). Younger adults, students, those having lost a job or on forced leave, and those with only elementary education displayed disproportionally high prevalence of mental disorders. Our findings suggest that population mental health has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. It seems that mental health of some population subgroups, such as young adults or those worse off economically, might have been affected disproportionately by the COVID-19 situation, and future studies identifying high-risk groups are warranted.","Winkler, Mohrova, Mlada, Kuklova, Kagstrom, Mohr, Formanek","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.032","20210601","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental disorders; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14210,""

"Tele-mental health services: a rapid umbrella review of pre-COVID-19 literature","Tele-mental health care has been rapidly adopted to maintain services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is now substantial interest in its future role. Service planning and policy making for recovery from the pandemic and beyond should draw not only on COVID-19 experiences, but also on the substantial research evidence accumulated prior to this. To conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews of research literature and evidence-based guidance on tele-mental health, including both qualitative and quantitative literature. Three databases were searched between January 2010 and August 2020 for systematic reviews meeting pre-defined criteria. Reviews retrieved were independently screened and those meeting inclusion criteria were synthesised and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative synthesis was used to report findings. Nineteen systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen examined clinical effectiveness, eight reported on aspects of tele-mental health implementation, ten reported on acceptability to service users and clinicians, two on cost-effectiveness and one on guidance. Most reviews were assessed as low quality. Findings suggested that video-based communication could be as effective and acceptable as face-to-face formats, at least in the short-term. Evidence was lacking on the extent of digital exclusion and how it can be overcome, and on some significant contexts such as children and young people's services and inpatient settings. This umbrella review suggests that tele-mental health has potential to be an effective and acceptable form of service delivery. However, we found limited evidence on impacts of large-scale implementation across catchment areas. Combining previous evidence and COVID-19 experiences may allow realistic planning for future tele-mental health implementation.","Barnett, Goulding, Casetta, Jordan, Sheridan-Rains, Steare, Williams, Wood, Gaughran, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.2196/26492","20210601","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14212,""

"COVID-19 pandemic: A review of the global lockdown and its far-reaching effects","COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020, leading to some form of lockdown across almost all countries of the world. The extent of the global pandemic due to COVID-19 has a significant impact on our lives that must be studied carefully to combat it. This study highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on crucial aspects of daily life globally, including; Food security, Global economy, Education, Tourism, hospitality, sports and leisure, Gender Relation, Domestic Violence/Abuse, Mental Health and Environmental air pollution through a systematic search of the literature. The COVID-19 global lockdown was initiated to stem the spread of the virus and 'flatten the curve' of the pandemic. However, the impact of the lockdown has had far-reaching effects in different strata of life, including; changes in the accessibility and structure of education delivery to students, food insecurity as a result of unavailability and fluctuation in prices, the depression of the global economy, increase in mental health challenges, wellbeing and quality of life amongst others. This review article highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown across the globe. As the global lockdown is being lifted in a phased manner in various countries of the world, it is necessary to explore its impacts to understand its consequences comprehensively. This will guide future decisions that will be made in a possible future wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global disease outbreak.","Onyeaka, Anumudu, Al-Sharify, Egele-Godswill, Mbaegbu","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211019854","20210601","COVID-19; corona virus; effects; environmental air pollution; impacts; lockdown; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14214,""
"&quot;Missing in Action&quot; in Psychiatric Nursing History: The Role of Chief Nurse Adele S Poston and Her Band of Nurses During World War I","This is the first nursing journal article to introduce the pioneering work of American psychiatric nurse leader, Adele S. Poston. Poston supervised a team of nurses as they cared for soldiers serving with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I in France. Poston and her nurses worked in the first American specialized neuropsychiatric hospital in a war. The soldiers they treated primarily had functional nervous disorders described at that time as &quot;shell shock&quot; or &quot;war neuroses.&quot; The traumatized officers and enlisted men were considered capable of being cured and returned to active duty based on research done by American psychiatrists among British troops during the first 3 years of the war. The story of Poston's career prior, during, and after the war and her work with other nurses during a global war are significant in psychiatric nursing history. Bringing this hitherto missing piece of psychiatric and nursing history into the light gives us a unique opportunity to recognize Poston and the nurses who served with her, even as today we recognize the nurses who serve during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

"Functional gastrointestinal and somatoform symptoms five months after SARS-CoV-2 infection: A controlled cohort study","Gastrointestinal infections represent a risk factor for functional gastrointestinal and somatoform extraintestinal disorders. We investigated the prevalence and relative risk (RR) of gastrointestinal and somatoform symptoms 5Ã‚Â months after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with a control cohort. One hundred and sixty-four SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 183 controls responded to an online questionnaire about symptoms and signs during the acute phase of the infection and after 4.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.3Ã‚Â months. Presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, somatization, anxiety, and depression were recorded with standardized questionnaires. Stool form and presence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were also recorded. Any association between exposure to infection and symptoms was evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted RR values and score differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Fever, dyspnea, loss of smell/taste/weight, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia were reported by more than 40% of patients during the acute phase. Compared with controls, adjusted RRs for loose stools, chronic fatigue, and somatization were increased after infection: 1.88 (95% CI 0.99-3.54), 2.24 (95% CI 1.48-3.37), and 3.62 (95% CI 1.01-6.23), respectively. Gastrointestinal sequelae were greater in patients with diarrhea during the acute phase. Mild gastroenterological symptoms persist 5Ã‚Â months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular in patients reporting diarrhea in the acute phase.

"Psychological symptoms during and after Austrian first lockdown in individuals with bipolar disorder? A follow-up control-group investigation","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, a global health crisis, has resulted in widespread socioeconomic restrictions including lockdown, social distancing, and self-isolation. To date, little is known about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on patients with bipolar disorder as a particularly vulnerable group. An online survey was conducted in Austria at two points of measurement (T1 April 2020 during the first lockdown vs. T2 May 2020 at post-lockdown). The sample comprises 20 patients with bipolar disorder (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.6Ã‚Â years) and 20 healthy controls (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.6Ã‚Â years). A 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 factorial design to compare two time points (T1 vs. T2) and two groups (patients vs. healthy controls) was used. Main outcome measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) and a (non-validated and non-standardized) assessment to determine COVID-19 fears and emotional distress due to social distancing. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the longitudinal association of COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing during lockdown (T1) and psychological symptoms after lockdown (T2). At T1, results demonstrated higher scores in BSI-18 subscales depression, anxiety and global severity index as well as emotional distress due to social distancing in bipolar patients compared to controls. There was a significant time x group interaction in the BSI-18 subscale somatization showing a decreasing trend in patients with BD compared to controls. No time effects in BSI-18 subscales or COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing were observed. Regression analyses showed that COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted somatization, only in patients. There was a connection between the lockdown measures and somatization symptoms observed in patients. When the first steps of easing the social restrictions in May 2020 took place, somatization decreased only in the bipolar compared to the control group. Higher COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted later symptoms at post-lockdown. Long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic need further investigations to improve current therapeutic approaches and prevent fears and distress during lockdown in individuals with bipolar disorder in times of crisis.","Dalkner, Wagner-Skacel, Ratzenhofer, Fellendorf, Lenger, Maget, Tmava-Berisha, Pilz, Queissner, Hamm, Bengesser, Platzer, Birner, Reininghaus","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40345-021-00222-8","20210601","Anxiety; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Depression; Global symptom load; Lockdown; Somatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14219,""

"Uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in a medium secure psychiatric hospital population","Patients in medium secure hospitals may be at particularly increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and complications. We undertook a service evaluation involving all current in-patients within a single, English medium secure hospital to describe the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among this population. Data regarding capacity to consent to the vaccine, acceptance/refusal of this (and reasons for refusal) and demographics was retrospectively collected from the patients' clinical records and analysed. In total, 85 patients (92.4% of eligible patients) had capacity to decide if they wanted the COVID-19 vaccine. Of these 68 (80.0%) consented and 17 (20.0%) declined to consent. A similar proportion of patients aged under and over 40 years old consented to have the vaccine. Those from a Black Asian minority ethnic background were more likely to decline the vaccine than White British patients. The reasons for capacitous refusal appeared similar to those seen in the general population.","Gibbon, McPhail, Mills, McBride, Storer, Taylor, McCarthy","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.924","20210601","Consent and capacity; comorbidity; epidemiology; forensic mental health services; in-patient treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14221,""
"Comparison of prevalence and risk factors of somatization between Chinese health care workers and non-health care workers during COVID-19 outbreak","This study aimed to compare prevalence and risk factors of somatization (SOM) between health care workers and non-health care workers during COVID-19 outbreak in China. From 14 February to 29 March 2020, an online survey was performed in both 605 health care workers and 1151 non-health care workers. Based on the somatization dimension score of the Symptom Checklist-90, participants were divided into non-SOM group and SOM group. Health care workers had higher prevalence rate of SOM (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) than non-health care workers, with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.22-2.36, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that in non-health care workers, the risk factors of SOM included other ethnicities, insomnia, and suicide, while in health care workers, the risk factors included working 6-8Ã¢â‚¬â€°h per day, and working Ã¢â€°Â¥10Ã¢â‚¬â€°h per day during COVID-19 outbreak. Our research suggests that both non-health care workers and health care workers have a relatively high prevalence of somatization. However, the related factors for somatization in both groups are significantly different, showing that medical service-related factors are associated with somatization in health care workers, while demographic and clinical factors are associated with somatization in non-health care workers.","Song, Zhou, Rao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03294-z","20210601","COVID-19; Health care workers; Risk factors; Somatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14222,""

"Interests, Motives, and Psychological Burdens in Times of Crisis and Lockdown: Google Trends Analysis to Inform Policy Makers","In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German government and the 16 German federal states implemented a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to decelerate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus prevent a collapse of the health care system. These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on people's interests, motives, and other psychological states. We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in people's search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. Our findings indicate that people's interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.","Rotter, Doebler, Schmitz","https://doi.org/10.2196/26385","20210601","COVID-19; Google Trends; burden; coronavirus; infodemiology; information search; infoveillance; mental health; online health information; pandemic; policy; trend","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-02","",14224,""
