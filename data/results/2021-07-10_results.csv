"Moderators of a resiliency group intervention for frontline clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic","To mitigate the psychological burdens of COVID-19 for frontline clinicians (FCs), we adapted an existing evidence-based resiliency program, Stress Management and Resilience Training Relaxation Response Program (SMART-3RP), for FCs. This analysis explores moderators of stress coping to determine which subgroups of FCs benefited most from SMART-3RP. 102 FCs from Mass General Brigham hospitals engaged in the adapted SMART-3RP. Assessments were completed at group entry (Week 0) and completion (Week 4). The primary outcome was stress coping, and we examined 15 possible baseline moderators. We fit linear mixed effects regression models and assessed potential baseline moderators using a likelihood ratio test. We report model-based estimates and confidence intervals for each moderator-by-time interaction (i.e., differential effect), where positive/negative values indicate more/less improvement in average perceived stress coping. Stress coping improved from Week 0 to Week 4 (mean improvement [95% CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.9 [0.6 to 1.2]). FCs with higher anxiety (differential effect [95% CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.3 [0.1 to 0.4]), depression (0.4 [0.2 to 0.6]), and loneliness (0.4 [0.1 to 0.6]), but lower levels of mindfulness (CAMS-R<sub>focus</sub>: 1.0 [0.4 to 1.6]; CAMS-R<sub>accept</sub>: 1.3 [0.7 to 2.0]) and self-compassion (0.4, [0.1 to 0.8]) at baseline experienced greater benefits in perceived stress coping from the SMART-3RP. Baseline health uncertainty along with sociodemographic and work characteristics did not moderate stress coping. Results highlight particular sub-populations of FCs that may benefit more from a stress management intervention, especially during emergency responses (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).","Sylvia, George, Rabideau, Streck, Albury, Hall, Luberto, Mizrach, Perez, Crute, Mehta, Convery, Looby, Fricchione, Fava, Wilhelm, Park","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.036","20210709","COVID-19 pandemic; Frontline clinicians; Resiliency program; Stress coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15822,""
"Perceived COVID-19-related anti-Asian discrimination predicts post traumatic stress disorder symptoms among Asian and Asian American young adults","This study investigates the prevalence of COVID-19-related discrimination and the extent to which COVID-19-related discrimination is associated with mental health symptoms among Asians and Asian American (A/AA) young adults during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from the COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study (CARES), a cross-sectional online survey conducted in the U.S. Out of 1,001 respondents, 211 A/AA young adults were analyzed for this study. Sixty-eight percent of A/AA young adults reported that they or their family have experienced COVID-19-related discrimination and approximately 15% of respondents reported verbal or physical assaults. After controlling for covariates including predisposing factors, lifetime discrimination, and pre-existing mental health diagnoses, COVID-19-related discrimination was significantly associated with an increased level of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but not of anxiety or depression. Our study results suggest that COVID-19-related discrimination may contribute to PTSD symptoms among A/AA young adults. This was cross-sectional data which was collected through online and self-report rather than clinical evaluation. This finding adds greater urgency to develop and implement policy- and individual-level interventions to reduce race-based discrimination among A/AA.","Hahm, Ha, Scott, Wongchai, Chen, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114084","20210709","Asian Americans; Asians; Covid-19; Discrimination; PTSD; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15823,""
"Association between COVID-19-related loneliness or worry and symptoms of anxiety and depression among first-year college students","To examine the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and mental health among first-year college students. Data for this longitudinal study (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°727) were collected before the school year (August 2019), end of fall semester (December 2019), and soon after the university suspended in-person instruction (April 2020). We used multivariable log-linear and logistic regressions to examine continuous and dichotomous outcomes on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. The most consistent predictor of during-pandemic mental health was feeling extremely isolated (versus not at all), which was associated with increased symptom severity of depression (proportional change[95% CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.43[1.87, 3.15]) and anxiety (2.02[1.50, 2.73]) and greater odds of new moderate depression (OR[95% CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.83[3.00, 73.41]) and anxiety (24.74[2.91, 210.00]).

"Perceived ability to comply with national COVID-19 mitigation strategies and their impact on household finances, food security, and mental well-being of medical and pharmacy students in Liberia","From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from WHO has promoted social distancing, wearing face masks, frequent hand washing, and staying-at-home as measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For many across Africa, compliance can be difficult. The aim of this study was to 1) understand the impact of student's household's ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, 2) identify predictors of mitigation strategy compliance, and 3) describe the impact of COVID-19 on household economics, food-security, and mental well-being. We conducted an email-based survey among current medical and pharmacy students of the University of Liberia College of Health Sciences between July and October 2020. The questionnaire was designed to explore their household's ability to comply with current mitigation strategies, as well as the pandemicÃ‚Â´s impact on the student's household's finances and food security. Descriptive statistics were used to delineate demographic characteristics. Logistic regression was used to model factors associated with ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, as well as participant's food security. 113 persons responded to the questionnaire. Seventy-six (67Ã¢Ë†â„¢3%) reported income losses as a result of the pandemic, with 93 (82Ã¢Ë†â„¢3%) reporting being ""somewhat"" or ""very worried"" about their households' finances. Seventy-seven (68Ã¢Ë†â„¢1%) participants reported food stocks that were sufficient for one-week or less. Forty (35%) participants reported eating less preferred foods or skipping meals in the past week. Overall, 20 participants (19Ã¢Ë†â„¢4%) had a positive depression screen. Study participants showed mixed results in being able to adhere to national COVID-19 mitigation strategies, with household level stressors experienced around finances and food security. Until Liberia has access to vaccinations for most of its citizens, COVID-19 response measures need to provide social protections that address basic needs (shelter, clothing and food), and which specifically targets food insecurity. Preventative interventions for mental health problems must be incorporated into Liberia's response to the pandemic.","Davis, Amorim, Dahn, Moon","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254446","20210709","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15825,""
"Dialogic gathering of films Promoting meaningful online interactions during COVID-19 confinement","A broad body of scientific literature exists on the effects that COVID-19 related confinement has had on the population: mental health problems, isolation, and problems concerning cohesion and employment, among others. However, there is a gap in the literature on the actions that reverse some of the effects generated during lockdown. This article collects the results of a study conducted with 53 people participating in a dialogic gathering of films (DGF) that was held online during two months of confinement. The data from the survey show that the development of this DGF generated improvements in 1) personal welfare and attitudes concerning the management of confinement, 2) living together and online relationships, 3) motivation and creativity in the professional domain, and 4) openness to a diversity of perspectives and realities, which improves the understanding, argumentation and positioning in social, scientific and ethical debates.","PadrÃƒÂ³s-Cuxart, Rodrigues de Mello, Ramis-Salas, Duque","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254132","20210709","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15826,""
"Gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability in the time of COVID-19: A multi-national, cross-sectional study of transgender and nonbinary people","Transgender and nonbinary people are disproportionately affected by structural barriers to quality healthcare, mental health challenges, and economic hardship. This study examined the impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis and subsequent control measures on gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and nonbinary people in multiple countries. We collected multi-national, cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and nonbinary adult users of the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of COVID-19. We conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to live according to one's gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in suicidal ideation. Individuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%, n = 264) and Thailand (20.6%, n = 205). A majority were nonbinary (66.8%, n = 644) or transfeminine (29.4%, n = 283). Due to COVID-19, 55.0% (n = 320/582) reported reduced access to gender-affirming resources, and 38.0% (n = 327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety (45.8%, n = 392/856). One in six (17.0%, n = 112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and 77.0% (n = 724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36-1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31-1.97), and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07-2.82) times higher for individuals whose access to gender-affirming resources was reduced versus not. The COVID-19 crisis is associated with reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of transgender and nonbinary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported in this sample. To improve health of transgender and nonbinary communities, increased access to gender-affirming resources should be prioritized through policies (e.g., digital prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender health initiatives.","Jarrett, Peitzmeier, Restar, Adamson, Howell, Baral, Beckham","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254215","20210709","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15827,""
"Brief psychotic disorder in COVID-19 patient with no history of mental illness","COVID-19 pandemic affects mental health globally. Reports showed the increase of mental illness as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the correlation between the COVID-19 and mental illness is not fully understood yet. We reported a brief psychotic disorder in a COVID-19 patient with no history of mental illness who was hospitalized in Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Psychotic symptoms appeared five days after COVID-19 onset and laboratory tests showed elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen. Elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen suggest an ongoing COVID-19-associated coagulopathy that might cause a microdamage in the central nervous system. It might contribute to the manifestation of psychotic symptoms. The correlation between brief psychotic disorder and COVID-19 requires further investigation.","Faisal, Taufik, Sugihen, Prasenohadi, Juliani, Yunus","https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14830","20210709","COVID-19; acute psychosis; brief psychotic disorder; neuropsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15828,""
"Exploring telemental health practice before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic","This study investigated how mental health providers' use of telemedicine has changed since the coronavirus disease (COVID) 2019 pandemic and their expectations for continuing to use it once the pandemic ends. A 15-min online survey was completed by 175 practicing and licensed telemental health providers who use telemedicine. In addition to personal and professional demographic items, the survey included items about the frequency of telemedicine use, proportion of caseload served by telemedicine, comfort using telemedicine before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and expectations to use telemedicine after the pandemic ends. A series of <i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> analyses, an independent samples t-test, and analyses of variance were conducted. The pandemic resulted in a greater proportion of telemental health providers using telemedicine on a daily basis (17% before and 40% during the pandemic; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and serving more than half of their caseload remotely (9.1% before and 57.7% during the pandemic; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Also, there was a statistically significant increase in their comfort using telemedicine before and during the pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Providers reported expecting to use telemedicine more often after the pandemic ends (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.35; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.99). Expectations to provide telemental health services after the pandemic were greater for mental health counselors, providers who practiced in rural regions, and providers who served patients through out-of-pocket payments. Telemental health providers use telemedicine daily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with expectations of continuing to use telemedicine in practice after the pandemic. This expectation is more prominent in certain segments of providers and warrants further investigation.","Zhu, Paige, Slone, Gutierrez, Lutzky, Hedriana, Barrera, Ong, Bunnell","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X211025943","20210709","COVID-19; Mental health; rural health; telemedicine; telemental health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15829,""
"Can SSRI/SNRI antidepressants decrease the 'cytokine storm' in the course of COVID-19 pneumonia?","Lots of research has been conducted to fight COVID-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. The role of 'cytokine storm' in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia is well known. Relationship between interleukins and depression is still subject matter of the research, but a correlation between interleukin-6 and depressive disorders is proven by now. The aim of this study is to verify differences among interleukin-6 blood levels of inpatients treated with SSRI and/or SNRI before and during hospitalization and of inpatients not treated with these drugs. This is an observational study performed during the first wave of SARS Cov-2 pandemic in Italy for three months. The hospitalized patients of Internal Medicine wards and Infectious and Tropical Diseases ward of Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi of Florence for COVID-19 pneumonia have been divided into two subgroups (treated / not treated with antidepressants). Patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit previously have been excluded. Each patient has been evaluated concerning demographic, clinical and therapeutic features. The first dosage of interleukin-6 detected during hospitalization has been noticed. 8,5% (n=34 patients) of the entire sample (n=402) had been treated with an antidepressant of the two considered categories before admission until discharge from hospital. Significant lower levels of interleukin-6 of recovered patients of the treated subgroup have been highlighted as compared to recovered patients of not-treated subgroup (12,1 vs 25,4 p&lt;0,001). These results have been pointed out in spite of higher mean age and more serious comorbidities of the treated subgroup. Nevertheless the incidence of severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is significantly lower in the subgroup of patients with antidepressant treatment (20,6% vs 43,2% p&lt;0,02) as well as endotracheal intubation employment (0,0% vs 11,7% p&lt;0,04). The rate of deceased patients of treated-subgroup is not significant lower than the rate of not-treated subgroup (23,5% vs 26,4% p=0,13). During COVID-19 pneumonia, the production of interleukin-6 seems to be modulated in presence of antidepressant therapy. Further proofs and broader surveys are necessary.","Fei, Santarelli, D'Anna, Moretti, Mirossi, Patti, Sanfilippo, Almerigogna, Berni, Caldini, Lagi, Para, Vaudo, Vultaggio","https://doi.org/10.23736/S0031-0808.21.04436-0","20210709","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15830,""

"Editorial: Mental health needs of children and young people of Black ethnicity<sup>1</sup> Is it time to reconceptualise racism as a traumatic experience?","We explore racial inequality in relation to Black children and young people (CYP) and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). We argue that the experience of racism should be universally considered an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE). We argue that racism and the vicarious trauma arising from exposure to frequent media reports of racially motivated violence against persons of Black ethnicity can all predispose Black CYP to increased risk of mental health problems. We make recommendations to improve Black CYP's early access to CAMHS, and to reduce their overrepresentation in psychiatric in-patient settings in the UK. This would require making CAMHS more welcoming to Black CYP and consideration of the impact of racism and trauma in the diagnostic and treatment formulation for Black CYP. This should include: the impact of racism in staff training, improving the cultural competence of CAMHS staff, and supporting Black CYP to articulate their experiences of racism and related traumas whilst facilitating their development of coping strategies to manage these experiences.","Ayodeji, Dubicka, Abuah, Odebiyi, Sultana, Ani","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12482","20210709","Black; CAMHS; Covid-19; Racism; health inequalities; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15832,""
"COVID-19 Confinement and Related Well Being Measurement using the EQ-5D Questionnaire: A Survey among the Palestinian Population","This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19 confinement on the population wellbeing using the EQ-5D questionnaire. After receiving the written permission from the EuroQol Research Foundation, an online-based survey was prepared and a total of 1380 participants were recruited via social media. The relationships of all the factors were studied as well as the scores of the EQ-5D including EQ-5D Index, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and each of the EQ-5D dimension. Linear regression for the Index and VAS and Logistic regression model were used to examine each dimension. The median EQ-5D Index and VAS scores were 0.65 (0.5-0.75), 80 (60-90), respectively. The most frequently reported problem was anxiety/depression (67.3%), followed by usual activities (48.6%). The statistical analysis showed that factors significantly associated with more reported problems in at least one EQ-5D dimension (P&lt;0.05) were: females, aging, being unmarried, low income, school studies, living in refugee camps, and villages, unemployment, having chronic diseases or pain, and obesity. It is important to note that participants responded in November showed more problems compared to December-2020. On the other hand, more problems were reported by participants who were infected, had known affected persons, had no enough information, perceived negative effect of confinement, and those indicated having a high infection chance (P&lt;0.05). This work provides important evidence on the health status and wellbeing during the COVID-19 confinement in a sample of the Palestinian population, affecting almost all the aspects of the health state and wellbeing.

"Community Health Workers Can Provide Psychosocial Support to the People During COVID-19 and Beyond in Low- and Middle- Income Countries","The COVID-19 pandemic has been the most challenging public health issue which not only affected the physical health of the global population but also aggravated the mental health conditions such as stress, anxiety, fear, depression and anger. While mental health services are seriously hampered amid this COVID-19 pandemic, health services, particularly those of Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs) are looking for alternatives to provide psychosocial support to the people amid this COVID-19 and beyond. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are an integral part of the health systems in many LMICs and played significant roles such as health education, contact tracing, isolation and mobilization during past emergencies and amid COVID-19 in many LMICs. However, despite their potentials in providing psychosocial support to the people amid this COVID-19 pandemic, they have been underutilized in most health systems in LMICs. The CHWs can be effectively engaged to provide psychosocial support at the community level. Engaging them can also be cost-saving as they are already in place and may cost less compared to other health professionals. However, they need training and supervision and their safety and security needs to be protected during this COVID-19. While many LMICs have mental health policies but their enactment is limited due to the fragility of health systems and limited health care resources. CHWs can contribute in this regard and help to address the psychosocial vulnerabilities of affected population in LMICs during COVID-19 and beyond.","Mistry, Harris-Roxas, Yadav, Shabnam, Rawal, Harris","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.666753","20210709","COVID-19; community health workers; low- and middle- income countries; mental health; psychosocial support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15836,""

We aimed to evaluate the anxiety and depression levels during the pandemic and identify the effect of pandemic-related stress on blood pressure (BP) control in primary hypertensive patients. A total of 142 patients with primary hypertension (HT) who continued to use the same antihypertensive drugs before and during the pandemic were included in the study. Twenty-four -hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire were applied to patients. We retrospectively reviewed 24-h ABPM records of the same patients for the year before the pandemic. Daytime, nighttime and 24 -hour-systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels as well as daytime, nighttime, and 24- hour-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels , were significantly elevated during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to the pre-pandemic period (p&lt;0.001). Higher HADS-A scores (HADS-A Ã¢â€°Â¥7) were significantly associated with much greater increase in BP compared to the patients with lower HADS-A scores. Psychological stress due to the COVID-19 outbreak led to worsening of the regulation of BP in controlled hypertensive patients whose antihypertensive treatments did not change.

"Optimizing Decision-Making Processes in Times of COVID-19: Using Reflexivity to Counteract Information-Processing Failures","The effectiveness of policymakers' decision-making in times of crisis depends largely on their ability to integrate and make sense of information. The COVID-19 crisis confronts governments with the difficult task of making decisions in the interest of public health and safety. Essentially, policymakers have to react to a threat, of which the extent is unknown, and they are making decisions under time constraints in the midst of immense uncertainty. The stakes are high, the issues involved are complex and require the careful balancing of several interests, including (mental) health, the economy, and human rights. These circumstances render policymakers' decision-making processes vulnerable to errors and biases in the processing of information, thereby increasing the chances of faulty decision-making processes with poor outcomes. Prior research has identified three main information-processing failures that can distort group decision-making processes and can lead to negative outcomes: (1) failure to search for and share information, (2) failure to elaborate on and analyze information that is not in line with earlier information and (3) failure to revise and update conclusions and policies in the light of new information. To date, it has not yet been explored how errors and biases underlying these information-processing failures impact decision-making processes in times of crisis. In this narrative review, we outline how groupthink, a narrow focus on the problem of containing the virus, and escalation of commitment may pose real risks to decision-making processes in handling the COVID-19 crisis and may result in widespread societal damages. Hence, it is vital that policymakers take steps to maximize the quality of the decision-making process and increase the chances of positive outcomes as the crisis goes forward. We propose group reflexivity-a deliberate process of discussing team goals, processes, or outcomes-as an antidote to these biases and errors in decision-making. Specifically, we recommend several evidence-based reflexivity tools that could easily be implemented to counter these information-processing errors and improve decision-making processes in uncertain times.","Schippers, Rus","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.650525","20210709","COVID-19; crisis; groupthink; information-processing failures; reflexivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15838,""
"What Type of Social Support Is Important for Student Resilience During COVID-19? A Latent Profile Analysis","In the face of the sudden outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), some students showed resilience in coping with difficulties while some did not. While different types of students showed different levels of resilience, are there significant characteristics among students with similar levels of resilience? In this study, 3,454 students (aged 15-25 years) were surveyed to understand students' perceived social support-coping modes while investigating the demographic characteristics and mental health status of subclasses of different modes. We found that (1) in the two subgroups of students with extremely low and low levels of perceived social support, the source of students' perceived social support did not have a clear orientation; in the two subgroups with moderate and high levels of perceived social support, the most perceived emotional support was from family and friends, while the least perceived support was companionship from teachers, classmates, and relatives, and problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family. (2) The degree of social support perceived by students is directly proportional to the coping tendency, i.e., as the degree of perceived social support increases, the proportion of students adopting active coping strategies increases while that of students adopting negative coping strategies decreases; thus, we concluded that high levels of emotional support from family and friends can increase students' tendency of adopting positive strategies to cope with difficulties, while problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family decrease students' tendency of adopting positive coping strategies. (3) Gender had a significant impact on the extremely low and low levels of perceived social support-negative coping tendencies; these subgroups accounted for 34.6% of the total students. Gender showed no significant influence on other subgroups, a school type had no impact on the distribution of the subgroups. (4) The higher the degree of perceived social support, the lower is the degree of students' general anxiety, and the lower is the degree of impact by the COVID-19 pandemic. The subdivision of student groups allows us to design more targeted support programmes for students with different psychological characteristics to help them alleviate stress during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Mai, Wu, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.646145","20210709","coping style; latent profile analysis; mental health; social support; student resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15839,""
"Cross-Cultural Comparison of Mental Health Between German and South African Employees: Shame, Self-Compassion, Work Engagement, and Work Motivation","The negative impact of the coronavirus disease outbreak 2019 (COVID-19) on work mental health is reported in many countries including Germany and South Africa: two culturally distinct countries. This study aims to compare mental health between the two workforces to appraise how cultural characteristics may impact their mental health status. A cross-sectional study was used with self-report measures regarding (i) mental health problems, (ii) mental health shame, (iii) self-compassion, (iv) work engagement and (v) work motivation. 257 German employees and 225 South African employees have completed those scales. This study reports results following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. <i>T</i>-tests, correlation and regression analyses were performed. German employees had lower mental health problems and mental health shame, and higher self-compassion than South Africans. Mental health problems were positively associated with mental health shame and amotivation, and negatively associated with work engagement and intrinsic motivation in both groups. Lastly, self-compassion, a PP 2.0 construct, was the strongest predictor for mental health problems in both countries. Our results suggest (i) that German culture's long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance and restraint may help explain these differences, and (ii) that self-compassion was important to mental health in both countries. While the levels of mental health differed between the two countries, cultivating self-compassion may be an effective way to protect mental health of employees in those countries. Findings can help inform managers and HR staff to refine their wellbeing strategies to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic, especially in German-South African organizations.","Kotera, Mayer, Vanderheiden","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.627851","20210709","Germany; South African; cross-cultural comparison; mental health; self-compassion; shame; work engagement; work motivation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15840,""
"Fatigue and Its Association With Quality of Life Among Carers of Patients Attending Psychiatric Emergency Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Aims:</b> Carers of psychiatric patients often suffered from mental and physical burden during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to the lack of mental health services. This study investigated the pattern of fatigue and its association with quality of life (QOL) among the carers of patients attending psychiatric emergency services during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> In this cross-sectional study, carers of patients attending psychiatric emergency services during the COVID-19 pandemic were consecutively included. Fatigue, insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. <b>Results:</b> A total of 496 participants were included. The prevalence of fatigue was 44.0% (95% CI = 39.6-48.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that fatigue was positively associated with higher education level (OR = 1.92, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and more severe depressive (OR = 1.18, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and insomnia symptoms (OR = 1.11, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). ANCOVA analysis revealed that the QOL was significantly lower in carers with fatigue compared with those without (P = 0.03). <b>Conclusions:</b> Fatigue was common among carers of patients attending psychiatric emergency services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the adverse impact of fatigue on QOL and other health outcomes, routine screening and appropriate intervention for fatigue are warranted for this subpopulation.","Ji, Li, Zhu, Zhang, Cheung, Ng, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.681318","20210709","COVID-19; carers; fatigue; psychiatric emergency service; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15841,""
"Yoga of Immortals Intervention Reduces Symptoms of Depression, Insomnia and Anxiety","<b>Background:</b> Depression, anxiety, and disordered sleep are some common symptoms associated with sub-optimal mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have grown increasingly more prevalent in the population. Due to social distancing and other limitations during the pandemic, there is a need for home-based, flexible interventions that can improve mental health. The Yoga of Immortals (YOI) mobile application provides a structured intervention that can be used on any mobile device and applied from the user's home. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,505 participants were enrolled in the study and used the YOI app for an 8-week period. Participants were asked to fill out three questionnaires: The Patient Health Questionnaire, 8 items (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). These three items were completed by 1,297 participants a total of four times: before starting YOI, two more times during use, and a fourth time after the 8-week usage period. Changes in PHQ8, GAD7 and ISI in participants were compared to a control group, who did not use the YOI app but completed all questionnaires (590 controls finished all questionnaires). <b>Results:</b> Participants reported significant decreases in depression and anxiety-related symptoms. Compared to baseline, PHQ-8 scores decreased 50% on average after the 8-week period. GAD-7 scores also decreased by 40-50% on average, and ISI scores decreased by 50%. These changes were significantly greater (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) than that observed in the control group. Participants who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and generalized anxiety reported significantly larger decreases in PHQ-8 and GAD-7 as compared to participants with no prior diagnosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Regular use of the YOI intervention over an 8-week period led to significant decreases in symptoms of both depression and anxiety, as well as alleviation of insomnia.","Verma, Donovan, Tunuguntla, Tunuguntla, Gupta, Nandi, Shivanand","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.648029","20210709","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; insomia; meditation; mental health; mindfullness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15842,""
"Psychological Distress Among the US General Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a significant global toll on emotional well-being, but evidence of mental health impacts in the United States remains limited. In April 2020, we conducted an exploratory survey of U.S. residents to understand prevalence of and factors associated with psychological distress during the pandemic. Data collection was conducted using Qualtrics, an online survey platform, and U.S. adult respondents were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Among 1,366 respondents, 42% (<i>n</i> = 571) reported clinically significant anxiety and 38% (<i>n</i> = 519) reported clinically significant depression. Factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms included Hispanic/Latino ethnicity; younger age; lower income; employment as or living with a health care worker-first responder; caregiver status; SARS-CoV-2 infection status; decreased frequency of engagement in healthy behaviors; and changed frequency of engagement in unhealthy behaviors. That some of these factors are associated with elevated distress during the pandemic is not yet widely appreciated and might be useful in informing management of mental health care resources.","Guerrini, Schneider, Guzick, Amos Nwankwo, Canfield, Fedson, Gutierrez, Sheu, Song, Villagran, McGuire, Storch","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.642918","20210709","anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic (COVID-19); survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15843,""
"Yoga Practice Is Beneficial for Maintaining Healthy Lifestyle and Endurance Under Restrictions and Stress Imposed by Lockdown During COVID-19 Pandemic","Uncertainty about Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and resulting lockdown caused widespread panic, stress, and anxiety. Yoga is a known practice that reduces stress and anxiety and may enhance immunity. This study aimed to (1) investigate that including Yoga in daily routine is beneficial for physical and mental health, and (2) to evaluate lifestyle of Yoga practitioners that may be instrumental in coping with stress associated with lockdown. This is a pan-India cross-sectional survey study, which was conducted during the lockdown. A self-rated scale, COVID Health Assessment Scale (CHAS), was designed by 11 experts in 3 Delphi rounds (Content valid ratio = 0.85) to evaluate the physical health, mental health, lifestyle, and coping skills of the individuals. The survey was made available digitally using Google forms and collected 23,760 CHAS responses. There were 23,290 valid responses (98%). After the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria of yogic practices, the respondents were categorized into the Yoga (<i>n</i> = 9,840) and Non-Yoga (<i>n</i> = 3,377) groups, who actively practiced Yoga during the lockdown in India. The statistical analyses were performed running logistic and multinomial regression and calculating odds ratio estimation using R software version 4.0.0. The non-Yoga group was more likely to use substances and unhealthy food and less likely to have good quality sleep. Yoga practitioners reported good physical ability and endurance. Yoga group also showed less anxiety, stress, fear, and having better coping strategies than the non-Yoga group. The Yoga group displayed striking and superior ability to cope with stress and anxiety associated with lockdown and COVID-19. In the Yoga group, participants performing meditation reportedly had relatively better mental health. Yoga may lead to risk reduction of COVID-19 by decreasing stress and improving immunity if specific yoga protocols are implemented through a global public health initiative.","Nagarathna, Anand, Rain, Srivastava, Sivapuram, Kulkarni, Ilavarasu, Sharma, Singh, Nagendra","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.613762","20210709","COVID-19; Yoga; coping straregies; global health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15844,""
"Cross-Sectional Study Protocol for the COVID-19 Impact Survey of Mothers and Their 7-11 Year Old Children in Alberta, Canada","<b>Objectives:</b> Our aim is to understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on families who have been followed longitudinally in two cohorts studied in Alberta, Canada. We will examine household infections during the COVID-19 pandemic, financial impact, domestic violence, substance use, child school and daily life and relationships in the home. We will identify risk and protective factors for maternal mental health outcomes using longitudinal data that can inform policy and government resource allocation in future disasters. <b>Methods:</b> Mothers who are currently participating in two longitudinal studies, Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON; <i>N</i> = 1,800) and All Our Families (AOF: <i>N</i> = 2,534) were eligible to participate. Mothers were invited to complete the baseline COVID-19 Impact Survey (20-30 min) within 4 months of March 15, 2020, which was when the province of Alberta, Canada, implemented school closures and physical-distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Mothers were asked to report on their own, their child's and their family's functioning. Mothers were re-surveyed at 6 months after completion of the initial COVID-19 Impact Survey, and will be re-surveyed again at 12 months. <b>Results:</b> Responses from participants in both cohorts will be examined in harmonized analyses as well as separately. Descriptive, multivariable analysis will be undertaken to examine risk and resiliency over time and factors that predict mental health and well-being. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study will provide timely information on the impact of COVID-19 for Albertan families. It will identify risk and protective factors for mental health and well-being among contemporary urban families supported by a publicly funded health care system to inform allocation of resources to support those most vulnerable during a global pandemic.","Letourneau, McDonald, MacKay, Bell, Hetherington, Deane, Dewey, Edwards, Field, Giesbrecht, Graham, Lebel, Leung, Madigan, McArthur, McMorris, Racine, Ross, Wu, Tough","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.597759","20210709","COVID-19; child; family; maternal; mental health; resilience (psychological); risk; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15845,""
"Addressing the Mental and Emotional Health Impacts of COVID-19 on Children and Adolescents: Lessons From HIV/AIDS","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to lasting mental health and psychosocial consequences just as were experienced with the HIV epidemic. A rapid review of published systematic reviews on HIV/AIDS and mental health outcomes and responses among children and adolescents was used to identify lessons for the COVID-19 pandemic response. The review found that HIV/AIDS responses to promote mental health, prevent ill-health and treat mental health conditions included diverse interventions at the structural or national, community, household and individual levels. Some of these responses can be easily replicated, others require substantial adaptation, and some can inform development of new innovative offline and online responses to mitigate impact of COVID-19 on mental health of children and adolescents. Programs that mitigate economic impacts including child grants, income generating activities for caregivers, food distribution, health care vouchers, and other economic empowerment interventions can be replicated with minor adjustments. Helplines for vulnerable or abused children and shelters for victims of gender-based violence can be scaled up to respond to the COVID pandemic, with minimal adaptation to adhere to prevention of contagion. Mass media campaigns to combat stigma and discrimination were successfully employed in the HIV response, and similar interventions could be developed and applied in the COVID context. Some programs will need more substantial adjustments. In health facilities, mainstreaming child-sensitive mental health training of frontline workers and task sharing/shifting to community volunteers and social workers as was done for HIV with community health workers, could advance mental illness detection, particularly among abuse victims, but requires adaptation of protocols. At the community and household levels, expansion of parenting programs can help caregivers navigate negative mental health effects on children, however, these are not often operating at scale, nor well-linked to services. Programs requiring innovation include converting adolescent and youth safe physical spaces into virtual spaces particularly for at-risk girls and young women; organizing virtual community support groups, conversations, and developing online resources. Re-opening of schools and introduction of health and hygiene policies, provides another opportunity for innovation - to provide mental health and psychosocial support to all children as a standard package of care and practice.","Banati, Idele","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.589827","20210709","COVID-19; HIV/AIDS; adolescents; children; mental health; psychosocial; rapid review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15846,""
"Teachers' Mental Health and Self-Reported Coping Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ecuador: A Mixed-Methods Study","This study assessed the psychological distress, life satisfaction, and perceived stress of Ecuadorian teachers who adopted online learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aimed to qualitatively report the coping strategies used to maintain their mental health and well-being. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from June to mid-August 2020. In total, 394 teachers completed the questionnaire, and from those, 320 also completed an optional open-ended question included in the survey. More than half of the participants reported taking care of children under 11 years and/or adults over 65 years. At the time of the study, most of the participants were teaching in higher education settings. Age was significantly correlated with all the psychological variables, females presented higher levels of perceived stress, and teachers with home care responsibilities presented higher psychological distress as well as perceived stress. Teachers who had previous training and experience with online teaching presented lower levels of distress, perceived stress as well as higher levels of life satisfaction. The most used coping strategies included seeking social support, exercising, and engaging in leisure activities. The results provide useful information to help develop initiatives that promote teacher well-being. Future studies should consider using a more diverse sample and dedicate attention to work-family conflicts as well as social and structural inequalities that may have a toll on teachers' mental health and performance.","Hidalgo-Andrade, Hermosa-Bosano, Paz","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S314844","20210709","education; lockdown; online teaching; psychological distress; self-care; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15847,""
"Addressing structural discrimination: prioritising people with mental health and addiction issues during the COVID-19 pandemic","Structural discrimination worsens physical health inequities and significantly reduces life expectancy for people with mental health and addiction issues. Aotearoa has recently made some notable changes in health policy by formally recognising the physical health needs of people with mental health and addiction issues. The COVID-19 vaccination sequencing framework provides an important opportunity to protect and promote the health of people with addiction and mental health issues. An expert advisory group, convened as part of the Aotearoa Equally Well collaborative, considered findings of a literature review on the vulnerability of people with mental health and addiction issues of contracting and dying from COVID-19. Evidence indicates an association between mental health and addiction issues and infection risk and worse outcomes. The group concluded mental health and addiction issues should be recognised as underlying health conditions that increase COVID-19 vulnerability, and that people with these issues should be prioritised for vaccination. For too long the health system has failed to address the life expectancy gap of people with addiction and mental health issues. Now is an opportunity to change the kÃ…Ârero. People with mental health and addiction issues experience significant physical health inequities.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on public sector ophthalmic work by New Zealand's ophthalmologists","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Zealand government enforced a nationwide 'alert level 4' lockdown from 26 March to 27 April 2020. We assessed the impact of this lockdown on New Zealand's public ophthalmology service. An anonymous online survey was sent to all New Zealand-based fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) after lockdown. Respondents provided retrospective assessment of practice patterns and their personal health during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was supported by national-level administrative data, allowing survey findings to be contextualised. Fifty-seven respondents (response rate 49%) working in the public health system participated. A large majority of respondents reduced elective clinic and surgical volumes by at least 75% (82% and 98%, respectively). National-level information confirmed clinic reduced to 38.2% of normal and elective operating volumes to 11.5%, with virtual visits increasing 17.9-fold. Elective clinic and elective operating volumes promptly recovered to usual volumes on the second month post lockdown. Most respondents (58%) followed the RANZCO triaging guideline, and 28% triaged emergencies only. At a personal level, respondents reported a significant physical health benefit (p&lt;0.001) associated with the lockdown experience, but no change in mental health or social wellbeing. Publicly employed ophthalmologists experienced dramatic reductions to elective clinic and operating volumes during the COVID-19 lockdown. The prompt recovery of service delivery volumes back to pre-lockdown levels supports the value of a COVID-19 elimination strategy in New Zealand.

"Understanding and Accommodating Patient and Staff Choice When Implementing Video Consultations in Mental Health Services","During the COVID-19 pandemic, some mental healthcare in the United Kingdom has moved online, with more likely to follow. The current evidence base for video consultations is modest; hence, this study seeks to aid decision-makers by reporting on one large National Health Service mental health trust's video-consultation pilot project. Patients' choices/preferences were gathered via online forms; and staff's views, through a focus group. The typical patient was female, 26 years old, living in a deprived locality. Consultations typically lasted 37 minutes, saving patients 0-30 minutes of travel and Ã‚Â£0-Ã‚Â£3.00. Satisfaction was high, and the software was intuitive. Audio quality varied, but patients felt able to disclose ""as if in person,"" were willing to use video consultation again, and found them more preferable than home visits and clinic attendance. Staff could foresee benefits but were concerned for their therapeutic relationships and were avoidant without familiarization, training, clinical coaching, and managerial reassurances especially regarding high-risk patients/situations. They argued video consultation would not suit all patients and should be used according to individual need. We found COVID-19 is necessitating staff to adopt video consultation and that patients are satisfied. However, unless staff's concerns are resolved, enabling them to use their full repertoire of interpersonal skills, therapeutic relationships will trump efficiency and video consultations may not remain their treatment modality of choice.","Painter, Turner, Procter","https://doi.org/10.1097/CIN.0000000000000804","20210709","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15850,""
"Update on Neurodegenerative Diseases and Glutamate: A PMHNP Single Case Study Report of a Diagnostically Complex Adult Patient, Interventions, and Unexpected Outcomes","While dysfunction of serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitters has been studied in depth, in regard to the etiology of mental illness, the neurotransmitter glutamate and its dysfunction is now being explored as contributing to neurodegenerative psychiatric diseases, schizophrenia, autism, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. This article explains its synthesis, neurotransmission, and metabolism within the brain and subsequent dysfunction that is responsible for neurocognitive loss associated with several psychiatric disorders. The case study will report on the screening for pseudobulbar affective (PBA) disorder in a 29-year-old male with bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual developmental disability who was experiencing extreme, uncontrolled emotional outbursts requiring continuous family isolation (pre-COVID-19) for safety. With the positive screen for PBA, the patient was subsequently treated with a glutamatergic drug, dextromethorphan/quinidine. The patient's unexpected response to this treatment including the acquisition of language, increased cognition, and improved executive functioning is presented. At 2 years post the initiation of treatment, his PBA screening score is reduced, uncontrolled outbursts and aggression have subsided, and the family can spend time outside of their home. Neurodegeneration and its impact is being researched and treated with medications affecting glutamate. The addition of a glutamatergic medication to this young man's medication regimen has improved both his and his family's quality of life. The psychiatric diagnoses, medications, and treatments associated with glutamate are explained in depth. The importance of nurses' understanding of glutamate, its synthesis, transmission, and dysfunction causing excitotoxicity and brain cell death and its impact on patients' behavior and safety is explained.","Kroll, Bennett, Klinefelter","https://doi.org/10.1177/10783903211030343","20210709","glutamatergic dysfunction; neurocognitive degeneration; severe chronic psychiatric illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15851,""
"The psychological effects of nursing interventions on patients with suspected COVID-19 during isolation","To investigate the psychological characteristics of patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during isolation and to evaluate the effects of psychological nursing interventions. A total of 137 patients with suspected COVID-19 were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire (TCSQ). Psychological nursing intervention measures were implemented, after which the patients were re-evaluated. Before intervention, the rates of anxiety and depression among the patients with suspected COVID-19 were 46.72% and 48.20%, respectively. After intervention, statistically significant reductions were observed in the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores (both P&lt;0.05). Before intervention, the TCSQ positive and negative coping scores were 31.07Ã‚Â±5.25 and 28.78Ã‚Â±6.72, respectively, compared with 36.40Ã‚Â±5.93 and 24.60Ã‚Â±5.99, respectively, after intervention; these differences were statistically significant (both P&lt;0.01). Before and after intervention, the patients' GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were negatively correlated with the positive coping score but positively correlated with the negative coping score. For COVID-19 or similar public health emergencies, timely and flexible appropriate psychological intervention and counseling is crucial. Correct implementation of psychological intervention methods can effectively relieve patients' negative emotions, and play an important role in assisting patients during the isolation period.","Niu, Ma, Zhang, Sun","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-516","20210709","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); isolation; psychological care; suspected patients","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15852,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, risk perception and coping strategies among health care workers in Albania - evidence that needs attention","Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted health care workers in many ways including mental health. This impact is usually underestimated in particular in developing countries. Objectives The study aims to assess the level of anxiety, depression, risk perception, and coping strategies of Albanian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify associated factors. Methods A cross-sectional online study was conducted from April to May 2020 by recruiting health care personnel through the snowballing method. Data collection was carried out through social media using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) by Google forms. Participants were recruited from all health care sectors including doctors, nurses, etc. working in both the public and private sectors. Results 410 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Most participants were nurses (59.3%), female (78.5%), and belonged to the age group 26â€“40 years (46.3%). Mild levels of anxiety were expressed in 26.9% of participants while 7.2% of them expressed moderate levels. 23.1% and 12.1% of participants expressed respectively mild and moderate depression levels. High levels of risk perception were found. A statistical association was found between occupation (p = 0.011), gender (p = 0.031), providing care for COVID-19 patients (p = 0.011), and the availably of mental health support in the workplace. Poor coping strategies were reported among participants. Conclusions Mental health support should be a priority of the healthcare system in particular for young health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients. It can improve the mental health status of health care workers and their family members, impacting the quality of care provided.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100824","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","",15853,""
