"The Transition to Telepsychology during the COVID-19 Pandemic: College Student and Counselor Acceptability Perceptions and Attitudes","The COVID-19 pandemic forced univaersity and college counseling and psychological service centers to swiftly switch to telepsychology service delivery to meet the continuing needs of student clients. This study was conducted at the onset and peak periods of the COVID-19 outbreak. We explored student client and counselor acceptability, attitudes, perceptions, experiences, barriers, and facilitators to remote telepsychology services using Qualtrics survey methodologies. Student clients and counselors were sent, via e-mail, two separate, but parallel anonymous questionnaires developed for purposes of this study. Results revealed that most student clients agreed that mental health service delivery via telepsychology was an adequate alternative to face-to-face therapy, there were few challenges with telepsychology with ease of access a key benefit. Student clients also felt that the therapeutic alliance was commensurate with face-to-face therapy while identifying lack of privacy in the home as the most problematic aspect of telepsychology. Counselors and student clients both identified convenience as the most important characteristic of telepsychology. Limitations are discussed as well as directions for future research.

"COVID-19 pandemic-imposed lockdown: impacts on the rural agrarian and the urban corporate workforce of India","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is inescapable which encompasses both physical and mental health myriads. To combat the pandemic, lockdown has been imposed worldwide, the impact of which, and, the subsequent new normal phase has raised global concern. Two workforces of the Indian population, rural agrarian and urban corporate, were compared for impact on sleep quality, depressive symptomatology, screen exposure, somatic pain and other health co-morbidities in three-time frames â€“ prior, during and post lockdown periods. An online survey was conducted for those engaged in the urban corporate sector (N=146) and an interview for the rural agrarian workforce (N=100). Both the workforces had adumbrated significant (p&lt;0.05) variations in sleep behavior with changes noted in sleep latency and feeling of sleepiness, being higher during the lockdown phase. The screen time had also been identified to be positively related to the presence of depressive symptomatology and negatively with sleep duration among both the workforces. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 induced lockdown affects the urban corporate more with erratic sleep behavior, enhanced psychometric distress, somatic discomfort and behavioral modifications that might be due to social isolation, reliance over digital use, and disoriented work scheduleÂ Â Â Â Â .

"A cross-sectional examination of Canadian adults' prosocial behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with distress and quality of life concerns among adults. Prosocial behavior (i.e., voluntary behavior intended to benefit another) is effective at improving individuals' mental health and well-being. COVID-19-related restrictions limit opportunities for physical and social interactions and might deter adults from engaging in prosocial acts. Impacts might be more pronounced in rural settings. The objectives of this article are to (a) provide a cross-sectional snapshot of Ontario adults' prosocialness during the initial stages of the pandemic (April-July 2020) and (b) examine whether adults' prosocial behaviors are different in urban versus rural contexts. As part of a large-scale longitudinal study, an online survey was administered to Ontario adults at baseline and included demographic information, the Prosocialness Scale for Adults (PSA), and three kindness-related questions. A total of 2,189 participants completed the survey. During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, adults experienced high levels of prosocialness (M = 39.2;SD = 5.6). No significant differences were found in relation to prosocialness between adults who lived in urban versus rural locations. Prosocial behavior during the early months of the pandemic was high among Ontarians in both urban and rural areas. Additional research should be conducted to explore prosocial behavior as an approach to mitigate some of the negative effects of the pandemic on individuals' mental health.

"Assessment of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of pharmacists: A nationwide survey","Objectives To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and work on the mental health and wellbeing of pharmacists in Nigeria and investigate the risk of exhaustion, disengagement, burnout, and their associated factors. Methods This was an online cross-sectional study among pharmacists that involved the use of mental health and wellbeing questionnaire including a 16-item OLBI questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to determine the study distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, while independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare the mean values of two and three groups, respectively. Tukey posthoc test was used to compare various practice settings based on significant factors, while a two-sided Dunnett t-test was used to compare between groups for other significant factors. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 612 pharmacists invited to participate in the survey, 426 completed and submitted the questionnaire giving a response rate of 69.6%. The Cronbach's alpha for wellness and mental health survey instrument in our study population is 0.74, while the average Cronbach's alpha for a 16-item OLBI questionnaire is 0.77 in our study population. The high risk of exhaustion and disengagement were met by 75.6% and 77.2% of the respondents, respectively. Eighty-three respondents (19.5%) met thresholds for either high risk of exhaustion or disengagement, while 66.2% had both a high risk of exhaustion and disengagement (burnout). Significant proportions of respondents with undergraduate pharmacy degree as the highest qualification obtained (70.6%, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), in the hospital practice setting (62.8%, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and in full-time employment type (68.1%, pÂ =Â 0.004) had the higher risk of burnout compared to their counterparts. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and work significantly impacted the mental health and wellbeing of a considerable proportion of the respondents. Burnout affects the majority of pharmacists in Nigeria and is linked to undergraduate pharmacy degrees as the highest qualification obtained, hospital practice settings, and full-time employment. Thus, mitigating strategies from employees, government, and organizations are recommended to help improve working conditions and promote the well-being of pharmacists in Nigeria.","Hedima, Erick Wesley, Okoro, Roland Nnaemeka, Yelmis, Gambo Amanda, Adam, Habiba","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcsop.2022.100109","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy;: 100109, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26380,""
"The evolution of young peopleâ€™s mental health during COVID-19 and the role of food insecurity: Evidence from a four low-and-middle-income-country cohort study","Objectives Provide evidence on how young peopleâ€™s mental health has evolved in Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries (LMICs) during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Identify particularly vulnerable groups who report high and/or continuously high rates of mental health issues. Study design Longitudinal, observational. Methods Two consecutive phone-surveys (Augustâ€“October and Novemberâ€“December 2020) in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam interviewed around 9000 participants of a 20-year cohort study who grew up in poverty, now aged 19 and 26. Rates of at least mild anxiety/depression measured by GAD-7/PHQ-8 were each compared across countries;between males/females, and food secure/food insecure households. Results Overall, rates of at least mild anxiety and mild depression significantly decreased between mid and end-2020 in all countries but Ethiopia as COVID-19 infection rates fell. Females report higher rates of anxiety and depression in all countries but Ethiopia, however the gender gap is closing. Young people in food insecure households have not shown consistent improvements in their rates of anxiety and depression. Food insecure households are poorer, and have significantly more children (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) except in Ethiopia. Conclusion Food insecurity is negatively associated with young peopleâ€™s mental health and urgent support targeted towards the most vulnerable should be a priority. Further research into increasing rates of mental health issues in Ethiopia is needed.","Porter, Catherine, Hittmeyer, Annina, Favara, Marta, Scott, Douglas, SÃ¡nchez, Alan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2022.100232","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Public Health in Practice;: 100232, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26381,""
"Multimorbidity associated with anxiety symptomatology in post-COVID patients","The COVID-19 pandemic hit individuals with chronic conditions the hardest. It is known that anxiety symptoms are frequent in post-COVID conditions. We want to examine whether multimorbidity is associated with anxiety in post-COVID patients. We reported descriptive statistics from 389 post-COVID patients and perform a linear regression with anxiety symptoms measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale. For each extra chronic condition, there was a mean increase of 0.11 in the HAD-anxiety score. However, there was a reduction for age and being male.

Using Joinpoint regression analysis, we estimated the expected suicide mortality in 2020 based on suicide mortality from 2011-2019, and compared results to the actual suicide mortality in Japan. We found that actual suicide mortality was significantly higher than the expected mortality among both men (excess mortality rate: 107.0%) and women (120.1%).

"An international survey examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on telehealth use among mental health professionals","Background COVID-19 has profoundly affected the work of mental health professionals with many transitioning to telehealth to comply with public health measures. This large international study examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health cliniciansâ€™ telehealth use. Methods This survey study was conducted with mental health professionals, primarily psychiatrists and psychologists, registered with WHO's Global Clinical Practice Network (GCPN). 1206 clinicians from 100 countries completed the telehealth section of the online survey in one of six languages between June 4 and July 7, 2020. Participants were asked about their use, training (i.e., aspects of telehealth addressed), perceptions, and concerns. Outcomes Since the pandemic onset, 1092 (90.5%) clinicians reported to have started or increased their telehealth services. Telephone and videoconferencing were the most common modalities. 592 (49.1%) participants indicated that they had not received any training. Clinicians with no training or that only addressed a single aspect of telehealth practice were more likely to perceive their services as somewhat ineffective than those with training that addressed two or more aspects. Most clinicians indicated positive perceptions of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. Quality of care compared to in-person services and technical issues were the most common concerns. Findings varied by WHO region, country income level, and profession. Interpretation Findings suggest a global practice change with providers perceiving telehealth as a viable option for mental health care. Increasing local training opportunities and efforts to address clinical and technological concerns is important for meeting ongoing demands.","Montoya, Madeline I.; Kogan, Cary S.; Rebello, Tahilia J.; Sadowska, Karolina, Garcia-Pacheco, JosÃ© A.; Khoury, Brigitte, Kulygina, Maya, Matsumoto, Chihiro, Robles, Rebeca, Huang, Jingjing, Andrews, Howard, Ayuso-Mateos, JosÃ© Luis, Denny, Keith, Gaebel, Wolfgang, Gureje, Oye, Kanba, Shigenobu, Mare, Karen, Medina-Mora, MarÃ­a Elena, Pike, Kathleen M.; Roberts, Michael C.; Sharan, Pratap, Stein, Dan, Zhao, Min, Reed, Geoffrey M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.050","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26384,""
"Investigating the relationships between resilience, autism-related traits and mental health outcomes among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Resilience is a dynamic process through which people adjust to adversity and buffer anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 global pandemic has introduced a shared source of adversity for people across the world, with detrimental implications for mental health. Despite the pronounced vulnerability of autistic adults to anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, relationships among autism-related traits, resilience, and mental health outcomes have not been examined. As such, we aimed to describe the relationships between these traits in a sample enriched in autism spectrum traits during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to investigate the impact of demographic and social factors on these relationships. Across three independent samples of adults, we assessed resilience factors, autism-related traits, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. One sample (recruited via the Autism Spectrum Program of Excellence, nÂ =Â 201) was enriched for autism traits while the other two (recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, nÂ =Â 624 and Facebook, nÂ =Â 929) drew from the general population. We found resilience factors and quantitative autism-related traits to be inversely related, regardless of the resilience measure used. Additionally, we found that resilience factors moderate the relationship between autism-related traits and depression symptoms such that resilience appears to be protective. Across the neurodiversity spectrum, resilience factors may be targets to improve mental health outcomes. This approach may be especially important during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in its aftermath.","Taylor, Sara C.; Smernoff, Zoe, Rajan, Maya, Steeman, Samantha, Gehringer, Brielle, Dow, Holly C.; Barzilay, Ran, Rader, Daniel, Bucan, Maja, Almasy, Laura, Brodkin, Edward S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.046","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26385,""
"Mid and long-term neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of post-COVID-19 syndrome: A meta-analysis","Importance Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that persist or develop three months after the onset of COVID-19 pose a significant threat to the global healthcare system. These symptoms are yet to be synthesized and quantified via meta-analysis. Objective To determine the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported 12Â weeks (3Â months) or more after acute COVID-19 onset in adults. Data sources A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted for studies published between January 1st, 2020 and August 1st, 2021. The systematic review was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. Study selection Studies were included if the length of follow-up satisfied the National Institute for Healthcare Excellence (NICE) definition of post-COVID-19 syndrome (symptoms that develop or persist =3Â months after the onset of COVID-19). Additional criteria included the reporting of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis Two authors independently extracted data on patient characteristics, hospital and/or ICU admission, acute-phase COVID-19 symptoms, length of follow-up, and neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Main outcome(s) and measure(s) The primary outcome was the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported =3Â months post onset of COVID-19. We also compared post-COVID-19 syndrome in hospitalised vs. non-hospitalised patients, with vs. without ICU admission during the acute phase of infection, and with mid-term (3 to 6Â months) and long-term (&gt;6Â months) follow-up. Results Of 1458 articles, 19 studies, encompassing a total of 11,324 patients, were analysed. Overall prevalence for neurological post-COVID-19 symptoms were: fatigue (37%, 95% CI: 24%â€“50%), brain fog (32%, 9%â€“55%), memory issues (27%, 18%â€“36%), attention disorder (22%, 10%â€“34%), myalgia (18%, 4%â€“32%), anosmia (12%, 7%â€“17%), dysgeusia (11%, 4%â€“17%) and headache (10%, 1%â€“21%). Neuropsychiatric conditions included sleep disturbances (31%, 18%â€“43%), anxiety (23%, 13%â€“33%) and depression (12%, 7%â€“21%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms substantially increased in prevalence between mid- and long-term follow-up. Compared to non-hospitalised patients, patients hospitalised for acute COVID-19 had reduced frequency of anosmia, anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and sleep disturbance at three (or more) months post-infection. Conversely, hospital admission was associated with higher frequency of memory issues (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4â€“2.3). Cohorts with &gt;20% of patients admitted to the ICU during acute COVID-19 experienced higher prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances than cohorts with &lt;20% of ICU admission. Conclusions and relevance Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog, memory issues, attention disorder) and sleep disturbances appear to be key features of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Psychiatric manifestations (sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression) are common and increase significantly in prevalence over time. Randomised controlled trials are necessary to develop intervention strategy to reduce disease burden.","Premraj, Lavienraj, Kannapadi, Nivedha V.; Briggs, Jack, Seal, Stella M.; Battaglini, Denise, Fanning, Jonathon, Suen, Jacky, Robba, Chiara, Fraser, John, Cho, Sung-Min","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2022.120162","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of the Neurological Sciences;: 120162, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26386,""
"""Structural inequities and the impact of COVID-19 on Latinx children: Implications for child and adolescent mental health practice"": Correction","Reports an error in ""Structural inequities and the impact of COVID-19 on Latinx children: Implications for child and adolescent mental health practice"" by Eugenio M. Rothe, Lisa R. Fortuna, Amalia Londono Tobon, Alejandra Postlethwaite, J.

In the original article, the last name of author Yohanis L. Anglero-Diaz was listed incorrectly. The name appears correctly in this record, and has been corrected in the original record. (The following  of the original article appeared in record 2021-32300-001). Latinx community is a heterogeneous population with diverse cultural origins, different migratory experiences, and different socioeconomic and educational realities. The disruptions to daily life and the associated stresses of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have been perhaps most acutely felt by Black and Latinx children from low-income families, including first-generation and undocumented immigrants. Child and adolescent psychiatrists need to provide evidence based, culturally responsive treatment for Latinx children and address structural inequities as part of their clinical practice, research, teaching, advocacy, and collaborative leadership. Millions of Latinx children are living in poverty. Their future is now further threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current crisis is calling on child and adolescent psychiatrists to think and act outside of the box by addressing the mental health consequences of inequities working across systems and with specific emphasis on culturally responsive and trauma-informed care now and into the future.

"Women healthcare workersâ€™ experiences during COVID-19 and other crises: A scoping review","Background Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as measures have been taken to both prevent the spread of COVID-19 and provide care to those who fall ill, healthcare workers have faced added risks to their health and wellbeing. These risks are disproportionately felt by women healthcare workers, yet health policies do not always take a gendered approach. Objectives The objective of this review was to identify the gendered effects of crises on women healthcare workersâ€™ health and wellbeing, as well as to provide guidance for decision-makers on health systems policies and programs that could support women healthcare workers. Methods A scoping review of published academic literature was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched using combinations of relevant medical subject headings and keywords. Data was extracted using a thematic coding framework. Seventy-eight articles met the inclusion criteria. Results During disease outbreaks women healthcare workers were found to experience: a higher risk of exposure and infection;barriers to accessing personal protective equipment;increased workloads;decreased leadership and decision-making opportunities;increased caregiving responsibilities in the home when schools and childcare supports were restricted;and higher rates of mental ill-health, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. There was a lack of attention paid to gender and the health workforce during times of crisis prior to COVID-19, and there is a substantial gap in research around the experiences of women healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries during times of crises. Conclusion COVID-19 provides an opportunity to develop gender-responsive crisis preparedness plans within the health sector. Without consideration of gender, crises will continue to exacerbate existing gender disparities, resulting in disproportionate negative impacts on women healthcare workers. The findings point to several important recommendations to better support women healthcare workers including workplace mental health support, economic assistance to counteract widening pay gaps, strategies to support their personal caregiving duties, and interventions that support and advance women's careers and increase their representation in leadership roles.","Morgan, Rosemary, Tan, Heang-Lee, Oveisi, Niki, Memmott, Christina, Korzuchowski, Alexander, Hawkins, Kate, Smith, Julia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnsa.2022.100066","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: International Journal of Nursing Studies Advances;: 100066, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26388,""
"Were self-described introverts ``immune"" to increased drug use and entrapment during the pandemic?","Background Social restrictions and other stressors related to the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted daily life in ways that might have increased drug use and undermined mental health. We investigated whether such changes depended on the amount and quality of a person's social activity. We also evaluated the popular idea that effects of pandemic-related restrictions would depend on introversion;to this end, we used self-described introversion as a proxy for preferred frequency of social activity. Methods Between September 2020 and March 2021, we obtained online-survey data from 2,615 respondents who retrospectively reported alcohol, opioid, or psychostimulant use. We analyzed (1) changes in drug use and entrapment (a psychological construct linked to suicidality) as a function of introversion and the frequency and quality of social activity, and (2) changes in drug use as a function of change in entrapment. Results Most felt more entrapped during the pandemic, but only a minority increased drug use. Generally: (1) entrapment and drug use increased in respondents unsatisfied with their social activity, (2) introversion and frequency of activity had less influence than satisfaction, (3) introverts reported more symptoms of entrapment, anxiety, depression, and loneliness than non-introverts, (4) when social activity was frequent and unsatisfying, psychostimulant use increased in introverts and opioid use increased in extraverts, (5) alcohol use increased in those who felt increased entrapment, and (6) alcohol and opioid use decreased in those who felt decreased entrapment. Conclusions Satisfactory social activity (even in small amounts) was associated with better outcomes, mostly without regard to introversion.","Panlilio, Leigh V.; Lee, Anysia, Smith, Kirsten E.; Epstein, David H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dadr.2022.100024","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence Reports;: 100024, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26389,""
"Vers une psychiatrie Ã©nactive et computationnelle","RÃ©sumÃ© Introduction La psychiatrie est confrontÃ©e au dÃ©fi dâ€™une pluralitÃ© dâ€™approches complÃ©mentaires issue des multiples niveaux de comprÃ©hension du vivant, que ce soit en termes de systÃ¨mes de reprÃ©sentations, dâ€™outils, de mÃ©thodologies et dâ€™objectifs. Dans le paysage clinique et scientifique actuel, les approches computationnelles et la multiplicitÃ© des nosographies Ã©mergentes telles que lâ€™approches des Research Domain Criteria du NIMH ou les modÃ¨les de staging participent Ã  cette pluralitÃ© thÃ©orique. En nous appuyant sur les limites du pluralisme scientifique, nous proposons une approche unifiant ces cadres thÃ©oriques fondÃ©e sur les principes de lâ€™Ã©nactivisme, une thÃ©orie des sciences du vivant innovante en cela quâ€™elle sâ€™applique Ã  la psychiatrie. MÃ©thodes Nous dÃ©taillons dans un premier temps le pluralisme thÃ©orique en psychiatrie, et ses liens avec la pratique clinique. Nous montrons quelles sont ses limites, et les raisons de la nÃ©cessitÃ© de thÃ©orie unificatrice pour la psychiatrie. Ã€ partir de ces limites, nous analysons les apports de lâ€™approche Ã©nactiviste pour la pratique clinique et la gÃ©nÃ©ration de thÃ©ories en psychiatrie. Nous montrons comment ce cadre pourrait amÃ©liorer la comprÃ©hension des symptÃ´mes en psychiatrie clinique, et unifier la diversitÃ© des approches complÃ©mentaires issues de la psychologie et des neurosciences. RÃ©sultats Le pluralisme comporte de nombreuses limites, inhÃ©rentes Ã  la diversitÃ© des approches thÃ©oriques quâ€™il implique et la difficultÃ© de modÃ©lisation computationnelle de ces diffÃ©rentes variables. Le cadre de travail Ã©nactiviste sâ€™inscrit dans les avancÃ©es rÃ©centes en psychologie et en neurosciences, notamment en permettant la modÃ©lisation computationnelle. Il est ancrÃ© Ã  la fois dans les sciences cognitives, la thÃ©orie des systÃ¨mes dynamiques, la biologie des systÃ¨mes et la phÃ©nomÃ©nologie, et peut ainsi Ãªtre proposÃ© comme rÃ©ponse Ã  cette question du dÃ©fi intÃ©gratif en psychiatrie. Discussion et conclusion Un nombre consÃ©quent de professionnels de la santÃ© mentale travaillent dÃ©jÃ  en acceptant une telle pluralitÃ© dâ€™approches cliniques et scientifiques, mais cette diversitÃ© participe Ã©galement au manque de structure thÃ©orique commune partagÃ©e par ces professionnels. Nous montrons que les formulations issues de lâ€™approche Ã©nactiviste permettent Ã  la psychiatrieÂ : (1) de prendre en compte la subjectivitÃ© et lâ€™expÃ©rience du patientÂ ;(2) dâ€™articuler diffÃ©rents niveaux de complexitÃ© au sein de la consultation cliniqueÂ ;(3) dâ€™expliquer les bÃ©nÃ©fices de la crÃ©ation de sens pour le patientÂ ;(4) de fournir des modÃ©lisations computationnelles concrÃ¨tesÂ ;(5) de soutenir la pÃ©dagogie en psychiatrie. Introduction Psychiatry is challenged by a plurality of complementary approaches. These challenges stem from the existence of multiple levels of understanding, i.e. systems of representations, tools, methodologies and objectives in psychiatryâ€“ranging from computational approaches and systems dynamics to the multiplicity of emerging nosographies, such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria project or staging models. In this plurality, a significant number of clinicians have adopted the biopsychosocial model. However, such a model has been widely criticized for more than twenty years. In parallel, science has declined a set of different pluralistic frameworks. Thus, through the challenges of computational modeling in psychiatry, we will see how the enactive approach of psychiatry could respond to this multiplicity. Indeed, such an enactive approach considers that perception is a (predictive) activity, which gives sense to the environment (i.e., sense making). Perception and, by extension, cognitive processes are not internal representations of the outside world, but they are deployed according to the 5E approach, i.e., an embodied, embedded, enacted, emotive and extended approach. Methods In this article, we first study the pluralist framework in psychiatry, in order to show its contributions in the clinical practice. Secondly, we analyze the contributions of the enactive approach for clinical practice in psychiatry. Results Two forms of pluralisms can be described: a non-integrative pluralism and an integrative pluralism. The first examines the coexistence of different potentially incompatible or untranslatable systems in the scientific or clinical landscape. The second proposes the development of a general framework, bringing together the different levels of understanding and systems of representations. However, pluralism has many pitfalls and limitations. Especially by allowing computational modeling, the enactive framework, anchored both in cognitive sciences, theory of dynamic systems, systems biology and phenomenology, has recently been proposed as an answer to the challenge of integrative psychiatry. Conclusions A significant number of mental health professionals are already working accepting such a variety of clinical and scientific approaches. We show that the enactive approach allows psychiatry: (1) to consider the subjectivity and the patient's experience, (2) to articulate different â€œgranularitiesâ€ within the clinical consultation, (3) to explain the benefits the creation of meaning for the patient, (4) to provide concrete models, (5) to support pedagogy in psychiatry. The enactive approach provides a conception for understanding psychiatric disorders as embodied, embedded, enacted, emotional and extended. In that way, the manifestations experienced by the patients are sense making experiences and can be conceived according to various levels of granularity.","Gauld, Christophe, Bottemanne, Hugo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2022.01.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Annales MÃ©dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26390,""
"Politics v science: How President Trump's war on science impacted public health and environmental regulation","During his campaign for president, Joe Biden vowed to â€œend the politics and follow the scienceâ€ when dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health and environmental crises. He was immediately criticized by then President Trump, who cast â€œlisten[ing] to the scientistsâ€ as something only a fool would do, and warned that it would result in a â€œmassive [economic] depression.â€ It is hardly surprising that Trump would take that position. After all, the Trump administration routinely prioritized economic interests, and worked tirelessly to remove what it viewed as unnecessary regulatory burdens on economic activity. The Trump administration regularly suppressed, downplayed, or simply ignored scientific research demonstrating the need for regulation to protect public health and the environment. The Biden administration has vowed to reverse course, but faces challenges in doing so due to the widespread assault on science led by former President Trump. The Trump administration's efforts to undermine science are documented in the Silencing Science Tracker, an online database, which records anti-science actions taken by the federal, state, and local governments. Drawing on more than four years of tracker dataâ€”from Trump's election to Biden's inaugurationâ€”we show that the Trump presidency fundamentally changed how federal government agencies perform, use, and communicate scientific research. While the Biden administration has taken initial steps to undo some of those changes, it still has significant work to do to restore the role of science in federal government decision-making. Its task is made more difficult by the public distrust of science engendered by the Trump presidency.","Webb, Romany M.; Kurtz, Lauren","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2021.11.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26391,""

"Coronavirus disease - COVID-19","In December 2019, the world witnessed the occurrence of a new coronavirus to humanity. The disease spread quickly and became known as a pandemic globally, affecting both society and the health care system, both the elderly and young groups of people, and both the men's and women's groups. It was a universal challenge that immediately caused a surge in scientific research. Be a part of a world rising in fighting against the pandemic, the Coronavirus Disease - COVID-19 was depicted in the early days of the pandemic, but updated by more than 200 scientists and clinicians to include many facets of this new infectious pandemic, including: (i)characteristics, ecology, and evolution of coronaviruses;(ii) epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis (immune responses and oxidative stress) of the disease;(iii) diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical manifestations of the disease in pediatrics, geriatrics, pregnant women, and neonates;(iv) challenges of co-occurring the disease with tropical infections, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cancer and to the settings of dentistry, hematology, ophthalmology, and pharmacy;(v) transmission, prevention, and potential treatments, ranging from supportive ventilator support and nutrition therapy to potential virus- and host-based therapies, immune-based therapies, photobiomodulation, antiviral photodynamic therapy, and vaccines;(vi) the resulting consequences on social lives, mental health, education, tourism industry and economy;and (vii) multimodal approaches to solve the problem by bioinformatic methods, innovation and ingenuity, globalization, social and scientific networking, interdisciplinary approaches, and art integration. We are approaching December 2020 and the still presence of COVID-19, asking us to call it COVID (without 19).","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Coronavirus Disease COVID; 19(964), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26393,""
"Pain tolerance feedback and deliberate self-harm in men and women","There is a growing literature supporting the idea that those who engage in non-suicidal deliberate self-harm (DSH) have altered pain perception compared to individuals who do not. For example, individuals who report a history of non-suicidal DSH behavior have a decreased sensitivity to transient pain during laboratory-based pain induction (e.g., Glenn et al., 2014). Research suggests that brief manipulations targeting individual beliefs can affect performance on subsequent tasks, including measures of pain sensitivity. To date, however, no study has examined the effects of experimentally manipulated pain perception on DSH behavior. The Self-Aggression Paradigm (SAP: Berman & Walley, 2003;McCloskey & Berman, 2003) allows for the prospective observation of the effects of experimental manipulations on a laboratory analogue of DSH. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine if experimentally manipulated false feedback about pain tolerance affects DSH behavior during the SAP, thus potentially providing evidence for a causal linkage between pain perception and DSH. Eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of three feedback groups: High pain tolerance, low pain tolerance, and a control condition with neutral feedback provided after completing the SAP. Participants were provided false feedback regarding their pain tolerance after a pressure algometer task. It was predicted that participants in the high pain tolerance feedback group would have the highest DSH on the SAP, with DSH defined as the level of shock self-administered during a series of reaction-time trials. No significant group differences, however, emerged based on group assignment. Men engaged in more DSH than women during the study independent of feedback group assignment. A secondary aim of the current study was to provide further validation for the SAP using multiple pain induction modalities. Implications of the current findings and future research directions are discussed.

"PSYCHOSOCIAL CHALLENGES AND EMERGING ISSUES OF COVID-19: A PERCEPTION-BASED SURVEY","Coronavirus pandemic situation is acknowledged as a terrifying situation to human beings and has generated a tremendous loss in many perspectives to human life worldwide. People get impacted by physical, psychosocial, economic, and environmental crises amidst any pandemic crisis. Objectives: The current study aimed to interpret and explore the perception of the impact of a pandemic crisis on mental health, emerging issues, and governance among the people of a developing country during the lockdown of Covid-19, the second wave. This study also assessed their knowledge to assess their level of mental preparedness during Covid-19. Methods and Materials: An online cross-sectional survey was performed among a sub-set of a developing country population using a modified pre-validated structured tool. The sample size was 124. Responses were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics of Chi-square and regression analysis. Results: About 55.47% (71) had adequate knowledge. The mean knowledge score was 6.04, with a Standard Deviation (SD) of 2.16, indicating a low knowledge level. There was a higher significant association between demographics and mental health in terms of variables of psychosocial domains (p&lt;0.05). Also, a negative association was found between their knowledge and their profession (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Partial lockdown at the time of the study due to Covid-19 has led the majority of the people to undergo mental stress disregarded to their age, education, or their boundness to the healthcare profession. The healthcare system needs to emphasize enhancing appropriate knowledge to adopt preventive measures and efficient protocols, including vaccination.","Tayyib, N.

"Capturing COVID: A pilot study using the EPII with long-term care staff","The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is a new virus responsible for a global pandemic and significant impacts on communities. However, the full extent of the impact on biopsychosocial well-being has not been captured. The present study investigated the Epidemic-Pandemic Impact Inventory (EPII), a newly developed measure designed to capture a person's experience of the pandemic across multiple domains of life, and a demographic questionnaire in a long-term care (LTC) sample. Healthcare work is considered essential during the pandemic and therefore healthcare workers must enter environments that place them at an increased risk for contracting and passing infectious diseases. COVID-19 has a unique impact on healthcare workers in LTC due to the nature of the setting (e.g., high likelihood of contracting or passing the virus, risk to patients, low access to resources). Additional exploratory analyses were performed to understand whether job title and self-identified race impacted response to the EPII. Fifty participants from three different long-term care facilities in Southern Colorado completed the EPII. Results indicated that LTC workers endorsed the greatest number of adverse experiences related to work and employment, infection, and quarantine. The EPII did not capture potential difference based on job title. However, White participants endorsed a greater number of problems with mental health and wellbeing compared to participants of color. This pilot study provided evidence for the utility of the EPII among a LTC population and identified potential areas to improve the psychometric properties of the assessment tool moving forward.

The people are surrounded by various uncertainties. The present time is giving rise to various distress like anxiety, depression, mental burnout. With the help of conceptual study, we analyzed the influence of present epidemic condition on employee psychological wellness. By drawing certain stressors like unemployment, job cuts, isolation, financial worries, zoom fatigue, panic buying, we measured the impact on mental well-being logically by critically examining the available literature. The search for articles was made in Google scholar, Web of Science scholar. Further, the study reveals that individuals are such a lot of terrified of getting COVID-19 that they are even ending up their life because of panic stigma or due to socio-economic reasons.

"The Effects of Flexi-Time Schedule on Physical and Psychological Ailments and Leisure Time Activities of Professional Workers","Exploratory research was conducted on a sample of 165 young professionals working in the private sector of age 20-30 with 3 -5 years of experience. Due to a diversity of lifestyles, the changing character of the workforce, and the current COVID-19 pandemic situation and the fundamental competitive demands of productivity, we are under increasing pressure to be more flexible with our work schedules. Work flexibility is becoming the new normal for most creative and intellectual employees. Employees with a flexible daily schedule have more variability in terms of work and other informal and formal activities in their life spaces. Several studies claim that there is a correlation between shift schedules and physical and mental health problems, which is often the result of persistent misalignment between the endogenous circadian synchronization system and behavioral cycles such as sleep / wake and fast / feeding. Obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, mood disorders, depression, cancer, and cognitive decline are likely the result of this disruption of the normal circadian cycle. They have little or no time to socialize while they work all night and catch up on sleep throughout the day. Not spending time with loved ones and engaging in human relationships, according to research, may have a huge impact on their health. In the long term, this subtle isolation might have a negative impact on their mental health.","Rikhi, Monika, Mehta, Sanjana","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effects+of+Flexi-Time+Schedule+on+Physical+and+Psychological+Ailments+and+Leisure+Time+Activities+of+Professional+Workers","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Education and Management Studies; 11(4):219-226, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26398,""

Veterans are more likely to have pre-existing mental health conditions compared to the general Canadian population, experience compounded stressors resulting from disruptions to familial, social, and occupational domains, and were faced with changes in health-care delivery (e.g. telehealth). The objectives of this study are to assess (a) the mental health impact of COVID-19 and related life changes on the well-being of Veterans and (b) perceptions of and satisfaction with changes in health-care treatments and delivery during the pandemic. Methods A total of 1136 Canadian Veterans participated in an online survey. Participants completed questions pertaining to their mental health and well-being, lifestyle changes, and concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as experiences and satisfaction with health-care treatments during the pandemic. Results Results showed that 55.9% of respondents reported worse mental health functioning compared to before the pandemic. The frequency of probable posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, and suicidal ideation were 34.2%, 35.3%, 26.8%, 13.0%, and 22.0%, respectively. Between 38.6% and 53.1% of respondents attributed their symptoms as either directly related to or exacerbated by the pandemic. Approximately 18% of respondents reported using telehealth for mental health services during the pandemic, and among those, 72.8% indicated a choice to use telehealth even after the pandemic. Conclusions This study found that Veterans experienced worsening mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of telehealth services was widely endorsed by mental health treatment-seeking Veterans who transitioned to virtual care during the pandemic. Our findings have important clinical and programmeadministrator implications, emphasizing the need to reach out to support veterans, especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions and to enhance and maintain virtual care even post-pandemic.

Objective This longitudinal study aimed to assess the combined impact of known socio-emotional predictors of stress-related psychopathology, namely anxiety sensitivity, anxiety trait, intolerance to uncertainty, and rumination, on COVID-related distress in healthy youth. Method A total of 92 parent-child dyads that previously participated in a laboratory-based experiment assessing observational fear learning in families between 2017 and 2019 (T0) were recontacted. Of them, 84 children aged between 9 and 14 agreed to participate. They completed online questionnaires in June 2020 (T1), September 2020 (T2), December 2020 (T3), and March 2021 (T4). Participants were free of mental illness at T0 and T1. To create a socio-emotional composite score (SECS), we measured anxiety sensitivity (Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index) at T0, trait anxiety (Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C)), intolerance to uncertainty (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children), and trait rumination (Childrenâ€™s Response Style Scale) at T1 and created a weighted z-score. To assess symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress (PTS), and depression in reaction to COVID-19, participants completed the State subscale of the STAI-C, the Childrenâ€™s Revised Impact of Event Scale, and the Childrenâ€™s Depression Inventory at T1â€“T4. Three general linear models were run with sex, age group (9â€“11 and 12+ years old), and SECS as predictors. Results Analyses revealed a SECS*Time interaction, with higher SECS predicting elevated anxiety symptoms at T1 and T4, and elevated PTS symptoms at T1 and T2. Conclusion These results suggest that healthy youth endorsing high levels of socio-emotional vulnerability to psychopathology have a higher risk of suffering from anxiety and PTS, but not depressive symptoms, in the year following a major stressor. HIGHLIGHTS This longitudinal study conducted in Quebec, Canada shows that healthy youth endorsing elevated socio-emotional vulnerability, as assessed by a composite score, report greater post-traumatic stress and anxiety symptoms, but not depressive symptoms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also reveals that girls and adolescents present greater symptomatology as opposed to boys and younger children.","Raymond, Catherine, Provencher, Jessie, Bilodeau-Houle, Alexe, Leclerc, Julie, Marin, Marie-France","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+longitudinal+investigation+of+psychological+distress+in+children+during+COVID-19:+the+role+of+socio-emotional+vulnerability+Una+investigaciÃ³n+longitudinal+de+la+angustia+psicolÃ³gica+en+los+niÃ±os+durante+el+COVID-19:+El+rol+de+la+vulnerabilidad+socioemocional+<U+4E00><U+9879>COVID-19+<U+671F><U+95F4><U+513F><U+7AE5><U+5FC3><U+7406><U+56F0><U+6270><U+7684><U+7EB5><U+5411><U+8C03><U+67E5>:<U+793E><U+4F1A><U+60C5><U+611F><U+8106><U+5F31><U+6027><U+7684><U+4F5C><U+7528>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 13(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26400,""
"Factors Associated with Increased Caregiver Burden of Informal Caregivers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","This studyâ€™s objective was to explore the association between various factors and the increased caregiver burden of informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. On February, 2021, 700 informal caregivers completed an online survey. We assessed the change in caregiver burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among all caregiver participants, 287 (41.0%) complained of an increased caregiver burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The factors associated with increased caregiver burden were depressive symptoms in caregivers [odds ratio (OR), 2.20;95% confidence interval (CI), 1.50â€“3.23], dementia (OR, 2.48;95%CI, 1.07â€“5.73) and low Barthel Index scores (OR, 2.01;95%CI, 1.39â€“2.90) in care receivers, care days (OR, 1.09;95%CI, 1.01â€“1.17) and times (OR, 1.06;95%CI, 1.01â€“1.10), and use of home care service (OR, 1.46;95%CI, 1.01â€“2.10) and visiting care service (OR, 1.71;95%CI, 1.20â€“2.45). These findings suggest we need to pay attention to the physical and mental health of both the care receivers and caregivers.","Otobe, Yuhei, Kimura, Y.; Suzuki, M.; Koyama, S.; Kojima, I.; Yamada, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Factors+Associated+with+Increased+Caregiver+Burden+of+Informal+Caregivers+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Japan","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: The journal of nutrition, health & aging;: 1-4, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26401,""

However, the measures aiming to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic included restrictions regarding these health resources. For many people, stay-at-home orders had aÂ negative effect on mental health and health-related behaviors such as physical activity. Young adults seem to be aÂ particularly vulnerable group. The study aimed to examine the relationship between changes in physical activity and perceived quality of life in young adults during lockdown conditions. We conducted an online survey during the second lockdown in Germany and assessed perceived changes in physical activity, social activities, quality of life (QoL), the perceived burden of changes in social activities, and current QoL in 212 young adults (63.7% women, mean ageÂ = 23.46, standard deviationÂ = 3.63). Young adults that maintained or increased their physical activity level under lockdown conditions, rated their current QoL higher and perceived aÂ less negative change of their QoL during lockdown compared to those with decreased physical activity. Furthermore, those who rated that their physical activity levels did not change or increased, perceived the reduction of their social activities as less burdening. The results indicate that physical activity is aÂ beneficial health resource during lockdown conditions. This highlights the importance of gaining knowledge regarding the antecedents of reducing physical activity and developing strategies that support young adults to be physically active in challenging times such as the pandemic (e.g. ehealth/mhealth approaches).","Niermann, Christina, Bollenbach, Lukas, Kanning, Martina","https://www.google.com/search?q=Perceiving+reduced+physical+activity+during+COVID-19+lockdown+is+related+to+lower+quality+of+life:+aÂ cross-sectional+study+with+young+adults+Die+Wahrnehmung+einer+verminderten+kÃ¶rperlichen+AktivitÃ¤t+wÃ¤hrend+des+COVID-19-Lockdowns+ist+mit+einer+geringeren+LebensqualitÃ¤t+assoziiert:+eine+Querschnittsstudie+mit+jungen+Erwachsenen","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: German Journal of Exercise and Sport Research;: 1-5, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26402,""
"Physical Activity during Pregnancy may Mitigate Adverse Outcomes Resulting from COVID-19 and Distancing Regulations: Perspectives of Prenatal Healthcare Providers in the Southern Region of the United States","Prenatal physical activity (PA) may mitigate adverse outcomes that have increased as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, including poor maternal mental health. This study explored the perspectives of prenatal healthcare providers (PHCP) on maternal PA during the pandemic and identified resources providers would like to have to inform clinical discussions and prescription of PA. Semi-structured interviews were completed with PHCPs following a qualitative description approach. A content analysis coded data to inform three study objectives: 1. Changes to maternal health, 2. The role prenatal PA can have during a pandemic, 3. Resources PHCPs would find helpful to discuss and prescribe PA. Nine PHCPs completed interviews. Changes to maternal health include an increase in stress, fear surrounding labor and delivery, and risk of pre-existing problematic behaviors (e.g., substance abuse). PA was identified as helpful for improving mental health and preventing excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG). Providers expressed interest in having low cost referral options for prenatal PA that are accessible from home. PHCPs suggest PA during the pandemic can improve maternal mental health and prevent EGWG. To support clinical discussions and prescriptions of prenatal PA, knowledge translation initiatives should include informing PHCPs of referral resources for low cost at-home fitness options.","Nagpal, Taniya S.; Maples, Jill M.; Duchette, Cathryn, Altizer, Elizabeth A.; Tinius, Rachel","https://www.google.com/search?q=Physical+Activity+during+Pregnancy+may+Mitigate+Adverse+Outcomes+Resulting+from+COVID-19+and+Distancing+Regulations:+Perspectives+of+Prenatal+Healthcare+Providers+in+the+Southern+Region+of+the+United+States","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: International journal of exercise science; 14(3):1138-1150, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26403,""

"It is a life Threatening infection","Mucormycosis is an aggressive, life-threatening infection that affects persons with a weakened immune system (immune-compromised), such as people with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or low neutrophil counts (a type of white blood cell). Persons whose immune systems are inhibited by pharmaceuticals (immunosuppression) as part of their therapy for blood cancer (haematological malignancy), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or solid-organ transplantation, or people whose immune systems are suppressed by medications (neutropenia).2 Patients with diabetes mellitus are more likely to develop rhino-cerebral mucormycosis, while patients with haematological malignancies are more likely to develop pulmonary mucormycosis. Consuming foods rich in Vitamin C Steps to Prevent Mucormycosis: (12) * Wear a mask to avoid inhaling fungal spores. * Avoid damp places where fungi grow and flourish. * Wear gloves while gardening to avoid contact with soil and manure. * Take precautions to avoid cuts and grazes. * Maintain overall cleanliness around patients. * Any oral ulcer should be treated immediately. Once mucormycosis has been diagnosed, CT and MRI scans can be used to determine the extent of the illness and guide surgical debridement. 14,15 Doâ€™s * Control hyperglycemia * Monitor blood glucose level post covid discharge and in diabetes * Use steroid judiciously * Use clear, sterile water for humidifiers during oxygen therapy * Use antibiotics Donâ€™ts * Donâ€™t miss warning signs and symptoms * Donâ€™t consider all cases of blocked nose as cases of bacterial sinusitis, especially in cases of immunosupression and covid patients on immunodulators. * Donâ€™t hesitate in seeking aggressive investigations as appropriate for detecting fungal etiology * Donâ€™t lose crucial time to initiate treatment for mucormycosis Transmission of mucormycosis:16,17 * It is not contagious and does not spread by contact of person to person. * fungus is found in the environment. * Transmission occurs through inhalation, inoculation, or ingestion of spores from the environment. * Although most cases are sporadic, healthcare-associated outbreaks have been linked to adhesive bandages, wooden tongue depressors, hospital linens, negative pressure rooms, water leaks, poor air filtration, non-sterile medical devices, and building construction. * It most commonly affects the sinuses or the lungs after inhaling fungal spores from the air.","Mankar, S.

"A case study of the wellness practices of Black pastors providing emotional support from the frontlines","Research indicates that Black pastors provide significant frontline emotional support to their congregants and the individuals living in the communities that their churches serve. Clergy are frequently the first mental health resource. Along with congregants' individual and familial traumas, Black pastors often address racial trauma and health disparities as evidence in the Coronavirus Pandemic. However, there is limited data on the wellness (self-care) practices Black pastors incorporate into their routines to guard against the symptoms attributed to burnout. This research study utilized semi-structured interviews, virtual worship experiences, and a focus group to voice the authentic emotional support of Black pastors and to highlight the self-care practices they implement. The study found that Black pastors address similar mental and psychological challenges as professionals from traditional mental health delivery systems. It also found that the participants utilize diverse self-care practices, and their perceptions and intentional utilization of self-care differ significantly. A key finding of the study revealed a connection between the participants' leadership styles and their consistent use of intentional self-care practices.The research also addresses the importance of counselors, counselor educators, and Black pastors collaborating to improve the overall counseling outcomes for Black people and individuals living in underserved communities.

"Rational emotive behavior therapy for deafblind individuals with progressive vision loss","Deafblind individuals with progressive visual conditions are presented with the challenge of adjusting to the gradual loss of sight over time and the social, psychological, environmental, and communicative implications relative to that process. Mental health treatment for these individuals is not widely researched due to the lack of homogeneity in the deafblind population;therefore, exploratory studies are necessary. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is an evidence-based treatment that has successfully addressed a range of symptoms in many psychological and medical diagnoses but has not been researched with individuals who are deafblind. In this multiple baseline design study, the researcher delivered a six-week REBT intervention to investigate its effect on symptoms of emotional distress, rational/irrational beliefs, and acceptance and adjustment towards vision loss. The study occurred during a global pandemic (COVID-19) and was therefore conducted via telehealth. The intervention resulted in improvement for two out of the three participants, with little improvement observed in the one participant likely due to confounding variables outside of the study's control. Additionally, results were maintained one month after the intervention was completed. These findings contribute to the research on REBT and support the need for more research using REBT with individuals who are deafblind.

"INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES OF COVID-19 IN THAILAND: ONE YEAR EXPERIENCE","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent disease cause by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. COVID-19 epidemic first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic by the first half of 2020. The first local transmission in Thailand began in late January 2020, four weeks after discovering the first case of COVID-19 in a Chinese traveler from Wuhan, with the first wave of the epidemic occurring from March to April of the same year. Here, we summarize data on number of COVID-19 cases within the country, including those placed under a mandatory two-week state quarantine. We discuss how Thailand overcame the first COVID-19 pandemic, which employed preventive measures, public health policies, travel restrictions, and planning for eventual vaccination. A key factor was strict COVID-19 prevention measures, which included mask wearing, social distancing, state quarantine, working from home policy, smartphone tracking applications, nationwide curfew, lockdown, and restricted entry into the country. However, these measures came with social and economic costs, viz mental (stress) and social health problems (job loss, financial problem and suicide) among people with or suspected of COVID-19. Although Thailand successfully ended the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak by mid-2020, a new epidemic wave originating from Samut Sakhon Province in late December 2020 has posed a new challenge.

"Undergraduate students' perspectives on mental health services, resources, and supports during COVID-19: A qualitative dissertation","During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased isolation from supportive relationships, uncertainty about the future, fear of illness, and lack of traditional life-events took a toll on university student mental health. It is important to understand undergraduate students' mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and their desires for support from their institutions of higher education. Existing studies have documented increased rates of depression, stress, and anxiety among university undergraduates;however, these studies rarely illuminate students' perspectives on mental health services, resources, and supports that they need during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenological study explored the perspectives of undergraduate university students on the need of university-provided mental health services, resources, and supports during the COVID-19 pandemic from July 2020-December 2020. To that end, the central research question addressed by this dissertation is ""How can an urban, public university in the southeastern United States support undergraduate student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic?"" The two sub-research questions are (1) ""What do undergraduate students state that they need/want from their institution of higher education to support their mental health?"" and (2) ""Which of the student requests to address their mental health needs are currently available and how can we increase their visibility, accessibility, and use?"" To answer these questions, the following data were analyzed (1) qualitative student survey data (n=491), (2) student semi-structured interviews (n=48), and (3) documentation of mental health services, resources, and supports available over time. Analysis of qualitative data collected through surveys and interviews followed the procedure outlined by Moustakis (1994). After laying the foundation with the literature review, content analysis was used to analyze survey data, thematic analysis was used for interview data, and documentation gathering strategies were used to create recommendations to support student mental health through the continuation of relevant services and increasing the visibility, accessibility, and use of existing services, resources, and supports. These findings may facilitate the connection of undergraduate student voices with university administrators leading to the provision of better access to mental health resources, services, and supports. As undergraduate student mental health is better supported, academic outcomes may improve.

It is a worrying disease as many positive cases are reported increasing day by day. The emerging of COVID-19 outbreak requires social distance and other interventions to protect human and environmental health. The objective of this study is to promote awareness among public university students on the importance of hygiene during the pandemic of COVID-19. Therefore, a study was carried out to assess the hygiene awareness among public university students during this outbreak. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey method among public university students. The study generally is aimed to determine COVID-19 awareness, attitudes, knowledge, and related behaviours among the students. The results show that most of the students are aware of the current issues of COVID-19, and at the same time they practice good self-hygiene to prevent themselves from getting infected. However, there is still room for the university students to improve their hygiene awareness, and exercising more complete precautionary matters to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Hazlyna, H.

Hence After a detailed study on different human health disease classification techniques it is found that machine learning techniques are reliable for the feature extraction and analysis of the different human parameters. CNN is the most optimum choice of classification of diseases. Feature extraction and feature selection is automatically managed by the CNN layers, which reduces the training speed. Techniques like sensor-based feature extraction like EEG, ECG, etc. will be further explored using machine learning algorithms for detection of early detections of diseases from human behavior on different platforms in this research. Social behavior and eating habits play a vital role in disease detection. A system that combines such a wide variety of features with effective classification techniques at each stage is needed.

"Contingency plan of the Clinical Management Unit for Psychiatry and Mental Health (CMUPMH) of the Infanta Cristina University Hospital (ICUH) for the COVID-19 pandemic","The letter briefs about the strategic steps taken by the Spanish government for the COVID-19 pandemic. The current situation led the Spanish government to decree a state of alarm in March 2020, including a renewable lockdown which, together with the experiences of stress generated by infection, isolation and grieving, are setting off reactions of anxiety, acute stress or aggravation of existing mental problems. Strategic guidelines are planned for three phases: an initial phase during the emergency, a second phase during the reopening, and a final phase of new normality, with different areas of action in each. Those phases could correspond to the different levels of risk established by the Ministry of Health depending on the epidemiological outlook. The Plan has followed the indications and strategic guidelines set out in the ROCMHA Guide. Changing scenarios make new organization of health care necessary at all levels of intervention. The CMUPMH has shown itself to be flexible and permeable during the pandemic, by reassigning functions and modifying procedures. Psychiatrists have acted as general practitioners, and Emotional Support Programmes have been set up for professionals and for family members. Homeworking and telemedicine have been introduced. Having a Contingency Plan for use in emergency situations enables us to prepare for new challenges and to anticipate changes, providing care for the most vulnerable sections of the population under the principles of equity, universality, efficiency and quality. Drawing up this plan enables us to identify a set of measures and concrete steps in response to any states of emergency that might occur in the future, turning a crisis into an opportunity.

"The relationship between internalizing psychopathology and poor sleep: Stability and the influence of the covid-19 pandemic and stress in youth and adult women","Through a multi-disciplinary approach, this dissertation is comprised of three studies which investigate the specificity between, and commonality amongst, internalizing psychopathologies in relation to poor sleep.The first study examines whether depression, anxiety or what is common between them is associated with poor Sleep Quality as indexed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in a community sample of youth and adult women. The results suggest that the common aspects of internalizing psychopathology are most strongly associated with poor Sleep Quality. Motivated by the broad and exacerbated levels of internalizing psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic, the second study examines the stability of the relationship between levels of Common Internalizing symptoms and poor Sleep Quality during, and prior to, the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the second study assesses the relationship between the levels of Common Internalizing symptoms and the shift to a later mid-sleep timepoint during the work or school week (MSW) from the pre-COVID-19 to the initial COVID-19 time period. It evaluates the posited relationship between internalizing psychopathology and MSW, and it assesses if the specific COVID-19 related change to later MSW is associated with COVID-19 specific levels of Common Internalizing symptoms.The third study leverages the stress that has been generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this study evaluates whether perceived stress moderates the relationship between levels of Common Internalizing and poor Sleep Quality and if that moderating effect is larger in magnitude during the COVID-19 time period as compared to the pre-COVID-19 time period.The results observed across the three studies suggest a strong relationship between the levels of Common Internalizing symptoms and poor Sleep Quality, and that perceived stress may moderate that relationship. While the results cannot specifically address the exact physiological mechanisms accounting for this relationship, nor why differences are observed between youth and adults, some potential mechanisms are discussed.

"Differentiating suicidal and non-suicidal bereaved individuals with and without prolonged grief disorder: An examination of risk factors","Complicated grief (CG) or prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is one possible outcome following the death of a loved one and is associated with emotional pain, yearning or longing for the deceased, feeling stunned or shocked, and difficulty moving on from the loss. PGD has a particularly strong association with suicidal ideation when compared with other forms of psychopathology. While the current etiology of PGD is not fully understood, the identity continuity theory proposes that disruptions in individual's social roles that are central to their identity drive the development and maintenance of prolonged grief. In conceptualizing suicidal behavior, including ideation, as maladaptive problem solving, suicidal ideation in PGD may be driven by this identity disruption. The purpose of the present study is to examine the relationship between specific symptoms of PGD and suicidal ideation. Data were collected from 423 individuals from Amazon's Mechanical Turk subject pool who had experienced the death of a loved one between six months and five years prior to study participation. Participants answered demographic questions, provided information about their loss, and completed self-report measures of psychopathology, suicidal ideation, and identity factors. We hypothesized that 1) consistent with previous research, PGD symptoms would be uniquely associated with suicidal ideation when controlling for other post-loss pathology (e.g., major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder), 2) role confusion would act as a risk factor for suicidal ideation via direct or indirect effects, and 3) self-as-context would moderate the relationship between role confusion and suicidal ideation. Results did not support PGD symptoms or diagnosis as a unique contributor to suicidal ideation. Role confusion demonstrated direct effects on suicidal ideation but no identified indirect effects. Self-as-context was not a significant moderator of this relationship. Implications and future directions based on these findings are discussed. In particular, attention is paid to the potential role of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in explaining the high degree of psychological distress and suicidal ideation in this sample. Much higher rates of PTSD and MDD symptoms were observed in this sample compared to previous Mechanical Turk samples, though rates of PGD remained consistent with previous studies. In addition, the possibility of bereavement-related suicidal ideation needing more specific measurement is discussed. Future studies should examine the degree to which these results remain after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed as well as to examine the need for bereavement-specific measures of suicidal ideation and alternative forms of measurement to the self-related variables in hypothesis three.

"THE (LITTLE) REALLOCATION POTENTIAL OF WORKERS MOST HIT BY THE COVID-19 CRISIS","Hospitality and entertainment are the sectors worst hit by the economic crisis that followed the COVID-19 pandemic. The possibility for the workers operating therein to find new jobs might be limited as they usually perform basic tasks and have low skill levels. We study the employment transitions of these workers before the COVID-19 crisis in Italy and find that, in the medium run, workers employed in hospitality were as likely to be employed as those in other non-financial private services were. Entertainment sector employees instead had a higher probability of being non-employed compared with other non-financial private services;if they found a job, these workers moved more frequently to other sectors. To get insights into the potential for reallocation during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods, we perform a simple counterfactual exercise based on the similarity in skill demand: the evidence indicates there is little reallocation potential for these hard-hit workers, especially if service demand remains depressed for a long time.","Basso, G.; Grompone, A.; Modena, F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+(LITTLE)+REALLOCATION+POTENTIAL+OF+WORKERS+MOST+HIT+BY+THE+COVID-19+CRISIS","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Politica Economica; 37(2):151-186, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26416,""

"The Impact of COVID-19-related Stress, Anxiety, and Depression on Sexual Health","The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the impact of COVID-19-related stress, anxiety, and depression on sexual health. With increasing evidence of psychological distress as a result of COVID-19-related confinement, physical distancing, and social isolation, there is an essential demand for comprehending whether diminished incidence of social and sexual connections has resulted in unsatisfactory mental health outcomes. In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that COVID-19 lockdown measures have negatively affected sexual health and behaviors. I carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout June 2021, with search terms including ""sexual activity + COVID-19,"" ""sexual health + COVID-19,"" ""sexual behavior + COVID-19,"" ""sexual life + COVID-19,"" and ""sexual desire + COVID-19."" As I analyzed research published between 2020 and 2021, only 379 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, I decided on 22, chiefly empirical, sources. Subsequent analyses should develop on intimate relationships, family functions, and sexual behavior of partners during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should thus investigate how COVID-19-related confinement, physical distancing, and social isolation have impacted sexual health.

"Psychological Support Application Using The Real-Time Webrtc: A Case Study Of Undergraduate In Malaysian And Indonesian Higher Learning Institutions","This paper presents the investigation of a psychological support application using the Web Real-Time Telecommunication, or WebRTC, in helping undergraduates who experienced mental health due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. In this study, the psychological support application using WebRTC was developed to assist undergraduates in dealing with mental and psychological health problems encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. The case study was conducted by distributing a survey consisting of the sharing, consulting and profiling modules of the application that have to be answered by the respondents. This application implements WebRTC as a platform for the user of the application to 'randomly' call another user. A user can choose whether to be the caller, the receiver, or both. The caller would be able to call the receiver when the specifications are chosen while the receiver is only able to receive a call. If both are chosen, the user would be able to initiate and receive a call. In order to connect one user to another in peer-to-peer communication, a signalling server is used. The results obtained in this case study showed that the COVID-19 outbreak has affected undergraduates' mental health and the developed application is able to help the undergraduates in healing their mental health. The developed application can improve the uses of other sharing platforms such as Face Time and WhatsApp Call._","Arshad, Mohamad Asrol, Galihkusumah, Ahmad Hudaiby, Md Rashid, Nor Aimuni, Buja, Alya Geogiana, Iskandar, Raja Muhammad Hanif Raja Rizal","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Support+Application+Using+The+Real-Time+Webrtc:+A+Case+Study+Of+Undergraduate+In+Malaysian+And+Indonesian+Higher+Learning+Institutions","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education; 12(5):1692-1698, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26420,""
"Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Community-Dwelling Older Adults","This cross-sectional online survey aimed to evaluate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of 200 community-dwelling older adults of both genders, ages varying from 60-80 years, belonging to rural and urban areas of Maharashtra. Participants were selected by using the snowball sampling method. The outcome measure for assessing anxiety due to covid-19 among them was Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). It was found that the overall prevalence of anxiety was 22 per cent on the coronavirus anxiety scale. While comparing the age, 70-79 years elderly were having a high level of anxiety during the lockdown. It was also noticed that in comparison to males females were more affected by anxiety during the lockdown. Based on the present findings, it may be concluded that the coronavirus pandemic harmed the mental health of community-dwelling older adults aged 60-80 years.

"Global Adversities, the Media, and Mental Health","Global communities are currently confronted with a number of complex problems and threats, the reality of which is amplified by the media. These environmental and socio-political stressors have been accompanied by the spread of problematic psychological and behavioural tendencies, such as the growing polarisation of opinions and values, online radicalisation and extremism, deepening xenophobia and nationalism, the proliferation of irrational beliefs and conspiracy theories, and resistance to rational public policy measures. Here we argue that although they fall outside the scope of psychopathology, they nevertheless currently constitute a major challenge for psychiatry as a research domain and a clinical practise. To substantiate this claim, we outline the mechanisms by which media-transmitted stressors impact mental well-being and possibly psychopathology. The common denominator of these global problems and the media's construction of reality is the increase in uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncontrollability, which prompts defensive responding and, in predisposed individuals, functions as a potent source of chronic stress. These contribute to cognitive inflexibility, a strong predisposing factor for the development of rigid beliefs and attitudes, which to varying degrees underlie the adverse psychological and behavioural tendencies mentioned above. We suggest that the tightening of beliefs and ideas that is the result of cognitive rigidity may correspond to the clinical characteristics of induced delusional disorder. This can be seen as a (ultimately maladaptive) defensive strategy for coping with a high degree of uncertainty and unpredictability. We conclude by briefly outlining the possible ways in which psychiatry can face this challenge.","Kesner, Ladislav, HorÃ¡cek, JirÃ­","https://www.google.com/search?q=Global+Adversities,+the+Media,+and+Mental+Health","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in psychiatry; 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26422,""

"Compounding inequalities: Adolescent psychosocial wellbeing and resilience among refugee and host communities in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated risk-mitigation strategies have altered the social contexts in which adolescents in low- and middle-income countries live. Little is known, however, about the impacts of the pandemic on displaced populations, and how those impacts differ by gender and life stage. We investigate the extent to which the pandemic has compounded pre-existing social inequalities among adolescents in Jordan, and the role support structures play in promoting resilience. Our analysis leverages longitudinal quantitative survey data and in-depth qualitative interviews, collected before and after the onset of COVID-19, with over 3,000 Syrian refugees, stateless Palestinians and vulnerable Jordanians, living in camps, host communities and informal tented settlements. We utilize mixed-methods analysis combining multivariate regression with deductive qualitative tools to evaluate pandemic impacts and associated policy responses on adolescent wellbeing and mental health, at three and nine months after the pandemic onset. We also explore the role of support systems at individual, household, community, and policy levels. We find the pandemic has resulted in severe economic and service disruptions with far-reaching and heterogenous effects on adolescent wellbeing. Nine months into the pandemic, 19.3% of adolescents in the sample presented with symptoms of moderate-to severe depression, with small signs of improvement (3.2 percentage points [pp], p&lt;0.001). Two thirds of adolescents reported household stress had increased during the pandemic, especially for Syrian adolescents in host communities (10.7pp higher than any other group, p&lt;0.001). Social connectedness was particularly low for girls, who were 13.4 percentage points (p&lt;0.001) more likely than boys to have had no interaction with friends in the past 7 days. Adolescent programming shows signs of being protective, particularly for girls, who were 8.8 percentage points (p&lt;0.01) more likely to have a trusted friend than their peers who were not participating in programming. Pre-existing social inequalities among refugee adolescents affected by forced displacement have been compounded during the COVID-19 pandemic, with related disruptions to services and social networks. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets to support healthy and empowered development in adolescence and early adulthood requires interventions that target the urgent needs of the most vulnerable adolescents while addressing population-level root causes and determinants of psychosocial wellbeing and resilience for all adolescent girls and boys.","Jones, Baird, Abu Hamad, Bhutta, Oakley, Shah, Sajdi, Yount","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261773","20220202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26424,""

"Diversity and inclusion in the legal profession: disclosure of cancer and other health conditions by lawyers with disabilities and lawyers who identify as LGBTQÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°","Given the training and experience of lawyers, we assumed that a study of lawyers' willingness to disclose disability in the workplace would provide an example of the actions ofÃ‚Â a group knowledgeable about disability law. The current study accounts for the effect of visibility of disability, onset and type of disability, and whether the lawyer has made an accommodation request. We also investigate the role of other individual characteristics, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, race/ethnicity, age, and job-related characteristics, in willingness to disclose. We use data from the first phase of a longitudinal national survey of lawyers in the USA to estimate the odds of disclosing disability to co-workers, management, and clients using proportional odds models. Lawyers with less visible disabilities, those with mental health disabilities, and those who work for smaller organizations have lower odds of disclosing to co-workers, management, and clients as compared to their counterparts. Attorneys who have requested accommodations are more willing to disclose as compared to those who have not, but only to co-workers and management. Women are less likely than men to disclose to management and clients. However, gender is not a significant determinant of disclosure to co-workers. Older attorneys are more likely to disclose to clients, whereas attorneys with children are less likely to disclose to co-workers. Lastly, lower perceived prejudice and the presence of co-workers with disabilities are associated with higher disclosure scores, but not for all groups. Individuals who acquired a disability at a relatively early point in life and those with more visible disabilities are more likely to disclose. However, such willingness is affected by the intersection of disability with other individual and firm-level characteristics. The findings imply that those with less visible disabilities and with health conditions acquired later in life are less likely to disclose. The relevance of the findings is heightened by the altered work conditions and demands imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic for cancer survivors.","Hyseni, Myderrizi, Blanck","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-021-01143-2","20220202","Disability disclosure; Future of labor; Inclusive workplaces; Workplace accommodations; Workplace discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26427,""
"Evaluation of Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Cardiovascular Disease Among Older Women in the US","Social isolation and loneliness are increasing public health concerns and have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older adults. To examine the associations of social isolation and loneliness with incident CVD in a large cohort of postmenopausal women and whether social support moderated these associations. This prospective cohort study, conducted from March 2011 through March 2019, included community-living US women aged 65 to 99 years from the Women's Health Initiative Extension Study II who had no history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary heart disease. Social isolation and loneliness were ascertained using validated questionnaires. The main outcome was major CVD, which was physician adjudicated using medical records and included coronary heart disease, stroke, and death from CVD. Continuous scores of social isolation and loneliness were analyzed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for CVD were calculated for women with high social isolation and loneliness scores (midpoint of the upper half of the distribution) vs those with low scores (midpoint of the lower half of the distribution) using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, educational level, and depression and then adding relevant health behavior and health status variables. Questionnaire-assessed social support was tested as a potential effect modifier. Among 57Ã¢â‚¬Â¯825 women (mean [SD] age, 79.0 [6.1] years; 89.1% White), 1599 major CVD events occurred over 186Ã¢â‚¬Â¯762 person-years. The HR for the association of high vs low social isolation scores with CVD was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.13-1.23), and the HR for the association of high vs low loneliness scores with CVD was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.10-1.18). The HRs after additional adjustment for health behaviors and health status were 1.08 (95% CI, 1.03-1.12; 8.0% higher risk) for social isolation and 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.09; 5.0% higher risk) for loneliness. Women with both high social isolation and high loneliness scores had a 13.0% to 27.0% higher risk of incident CVD than did women with low social isolation and low loneliness scores. Social support was not a significant effect modifier of the associations (social isolationÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°social support: r, -0.18; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.86; lonelinessÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°social support: r, 0.78; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.48). In this cohort study, social isolation and loneliness were independently associated with modestly higher risk of CVD among postmenopausal women in the US, and women with both social isolation and loneliness had greater CVD risk than did those with either exposure alone. The findings suggest that these prevalent psychosocial processes merit increased attention for prevention of CVD in older women, particularly in the era of COVID-19.","Golaszewski, LaCroix, Godino, Allison, Manson, King, Weitlauf, Bea, Garcia, Kroenke, Saquib, Cannell, Nguyen, Bellettiere","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.46461","20220202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26428,""
"Transition of Social Isolation and Its Related Factors During Two Mild Lockdown Periods During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Survey in Japan","Lockdowns and ""stay-at-home"" orders announced internationally for COVID-19 have led to physical and social distancing, with reports of many individuals experiencing social isolation and loneliness. Although the emergency declaration in Japan was declared as a mild lockdown requested by the government without penalties for violations, the lockdown measures, including social isolation, had several influences on people's lives and mental health as in other countries. Furthermore, Japan declared a state of emergency multiple times; thus, it is necessary to examine the influence of the transition of social isolation caused by repeated emergency declarations and the deterioration of mental health associated with these changes. This study longitudinally investigated the transition of social isolation and its related factors during the ""mild lockdown"" under two declared states of emergency in Japan and analyzed psychosocial characteristics extracting clusters where people with specific transition patterns of social isolation predominated. We collected data on 7893 inhabitants (46.8% women, 49.6 Ã‚Â± 13.7 years) living in the seven prefectures where the initial emergency declaration was applied. The investigations took place online in the final phase of the first and second states of emergency: Phase 1 (between May 11 and 12, 2020) and Phase 2 (between February 24 and 28, 2021). Nonparametric Bayesian co-clustering was used to visualize the exhaustive interaction structure between the transition pattern of social isolation and the psychosocial variables. There were no improvements in social networks and loneliness between the two phases, although psychological distress significantly improved and depression decreased slightly. Forty-nine percent of the participants remained socially isolated through Phases 1 and 2, and 12% were socially isolated in Phase 2, even though they were not socially isolated in Phase 1. More participants experienced persistent social isolation in unmarried, childless, and low household income groups. The persistent social isolation group had fewer cohabitants than other transition pattern groups. The nonparametric Bayesian co-clustering results showed that most clusters, including participants without social isolation throughout Phases 1 and 2, had healthy behaviors, more interactions, good relationships, and less loneliness and psychological stress. Furthermore, the cluster in which relationships deteriorated in Phase 1 recovered in Phase 2. Comparatively, the clusters with social isolation throughout Phases 1 and 2 were divided into clusters with increased loneliness and psychological stress; clusters were close to participants' average scores in this study. The clusters with increased loneliness and psychological stress were notable for deteriorating relationships and less online interaction. This study revealed the actual state of transition of social isolation and related psychological, social, and behavioral factors under repeated declarations of a state of emergency. These results should help construct intervention methods that fit individual characteristics for people in social isolation during a pandemic.","Sugaya, Yamamoto, Suzuki, Uchiumi","https://doi.org/10.2196/32694","20220202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26429,""
"Human Organoids and Organs-on-Chips for Addressing COVID-19 Challenges","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses an imminent threat to our lives. Although animal models and monolayer cell cultures are utilized for pathogenesis studies and the development of COVID-19 therapeutics, models that can more accurately reflect human-relevant responses to this novel virus are still lacking. Stem cell organoids and bioengineered organs-on-chips have emerged as two cutting-edge technologies used to construct biomimetic in vitro three-dimensional (3D) tissue or organ models. In this review, the key features of these two model systems that allow them to recapitulate organ physiology and function are introduced. The recent progress of these technologies for virology research is summarized and their utility in meeting the COVID-19 pandemic is highlighted. Future opportunities and challenges in the development of advanced human organ models and their potential to accelerate translational applications to provide vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 and other emerging epidemics are also discussed.","Wang, Wang, Qin","https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202105187","20220202","coronavirus disease 2019; human models in vitro; organoids; organs-on-chips; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26430,""
"Psychological impact on care professionals due to the SARS-Cov-2 virus in Spain","To analyze the psychological impact of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic on nurses in Spain in three different dimensions: exposure to stressors, perceived emotions, and stress coping. On March 11, 2019, the World Health Organization recognized a global pandemic caused by a SARS-Cov-2 virus, COVID-19, which rapidly spread across the planet, involving a community health emergency of international scope. The pandemic situation in health centers has led to significant changes in the work environment, compromising care professionals' physical and psychological health and resulting in strong physical and mental exhaustion. An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out, between February and April 2021, in a large sample of 1360 participants. The researchers conducted the dissemination of a validated questionnaire to working nurses in Spain. The sex variable in relation to the study dimensions (stressors, perceived emotions, and coping strategies) showed a mean for stressors of 62.2 Ã‚Â± 10.5 in women and 59.8 Ã‚Â± 12.5 in men (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.010), showing statistically significant differences. Age was a protective factor for all dimensions (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Time of experience showed statistically significant differences for stressors and coping strategies in professionals with more than 15 years of experience. Female nurses who are younger, have less work experience, have not built a family of their own, and live in smaller or indoor flats may be more vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health. Other national and international studies, in this line, have shown an important psychological impact on these professionals. It is necessary to design and adopt effective strategies and measures for the protection of nurses' mental health, as well as for the prevention and early diagnosis of possible mental health problems.","Santolalla-Arnedo, Pozo-Herce, De ViÃƒÂ±aspre-Hernandez, Gea-Caballero, Juarez-Vela, Gil-Fernandez, Garrido-Garcia, Echaniz-Serrano, Czapla, Rodriguez-Velasco","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12748","20220202","COVID-19; Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; mental health; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26431,""
"Association between eating balanced meals and depressive symptoms in Japanese hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","While accumulating evidence suggests a protective role of healthy diet against depression, evidence on this issue is limited among healthcare workers combating COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the cross-sectional association between frequency of balanced meal consumption and depressive symptoms among Japanese hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 2,457 workers of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine who responded to a questionnaire survey in October or December 2020. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The number of days per week of eating two or more balanced meals was categorized into four from Ã¢â€°Â¤1Ã‚Â day/week to daily. The association between frequency of balanced meal consumption and depressive symptoms was assessed using logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for lifestyle and COVID-19-related factors. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 14.8%. The odds of depressive symptoms increased with decreasing frequency of balanced meal consumption. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of depressive symptoms were 1.00 (reference), 1.09 (0.75-1.58), 1.62 (1.17-2.24), and 2.21 (1.54-3.17) for balanced meal consumption categories of daily, 4-5Ã‚Â days/week, 2-3Ã‚Â days/week, and Ã¢â€°Â¤1Ã‚Â day/week, respectively (P for trend&lt;0.001).

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young children and their caregivers","The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted child development and the well-being of caregivers, and such evidence ought to be used to inform public policy decisions. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on children's behaviors and their caregivers' needs. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 153 caregivers of children (from 0 to 5 years old) from three public daycare centers in Brazil. The Nurturing Care Framework of the World Health Organization was used to guide the assessment of caregivers' needs. Online data collection using a questionnaire was conducted from June to July 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic increased stressors such as low family income, unemployment, sadness, depression, and anxiety of caregivers. Their most commonly reported needs were related to offering age-appropriate playful activities (49.7%), organizing the care routine of children at home (41.8%), and educating children when they do something wrong (39.9%). Additionally, the results showed that misbehavior, aggressiveness, and agitation occurred more frequently among preschoolers than infants or toddlers (p Ã¢â€°Â¤ .05).

"Academic performance and attitudes of dental students impacted by COVID-19","Previous studies only focused on attitudes and behaviors of US dental students without examining direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic performance. This study examined effects of COVID-19 pandemic on dental students' academic performance, self-reported attitudes, behavior, and service utilization. We hypothesized that the pandemic provided more beneficial learning environments. This mixed study design implemented a cross sectional survey with retrospective extraction of students' academic grades. A survey of 274 predoctoral students assessed self-reported attitudes/behaviors and service utilization. First year Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD1) 2021-2024 students' academic performance data were extracted. Independent t-test and chi-square crosstab analyses were conducted assessing differences between pre-COVID and post-COVID cohorts. Participants' academic grades identified statistically significant associations between pre-/post-COVID grades in five of 12 DMD1 courses. Grade percentages identified increased average grades in four of 12 DMD1 courses, with one of 12 courses demonstrating decreased grade percentage. Half of survey participants were female (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 37/72, 51.4%), 79.2% were 25-34 years old, and 44.4% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 32) were DMD 2024. About 1/5 (20.8%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15) sought counseling/therapy. Students agreed staying home allowed more time to study (66.7%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 48), while 59.2% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 42) reported increased financial concerns. A majority reported lacking in-person group studying decreased performance, and 55.6% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 40) reported feeling depressed. Students performed better overall in courses delivered remotely with clinical application and team-based engagement. Students performed equally overall; however, the majority had concerns regarding finances, group studying, and mental health challenges.

"Persistence, Magnitude, and Patterns of Postacute Symptoms and Quality of Life Following Onset of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Cohort Description and Approaches for Measurement","There is mounting evidence for the presence of postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC), but there is limited information on the spectrum, magnitude, duration, and patterns of these sequelae as well as their influence on quality of life. We assembled a cohort of adults with a documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity atÃ¢â‚¬â€¦Ã¢â€°Â¥2 weeks past onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first positive test. At 4-month intervals, we queried physical and mental health symptoms and quality of life. Of the first 179 participants enrolled, 10 were asymptomatic during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 125 were symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 were symptomatic and hospitalized. During the postacute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping, and anosmia/dysgeusia were most common through 8 months of observation. Symptoms were typically at least somewhat bothersome and sometimes exhibited a waxing-and-waning course. Some participants experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months compared with pre-COVID-19. Two clusters of symptom domains were identified. Many participants report bothersome symptoms following onset of COVID-19 with variable patterns of persistence and impact on quality of life. The substantial variability suggests the existence of multiple subphenotypes of PASC.

"The relationship between behavioral problems and screen time in children during COVID-19 school closures in Japan","Studies have shown that COVID-19 school closures negatively impacted children's well-being. We assessed the impact of school closures on children in Japan. We postulated that screen time and sleep habits during school closure would be associated with children's mental health status. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 959 children in four public elementary schools. Parents completed an original questionnaire in which we enquired about children's behavioral problems, screen time (duration of watching TV/videos and duration of playing video games), sleep habits, and bodyweight change during school closure. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationships between behavioral problems, bodyweight gain, and screen time. It was found that 50.3% of children exhibited some behavioral problems during school closure; fewer children exhibited such problems after schools reopened. Moreover, children's behavioral problems during school closure were associated with longer total screen time (odds ratio [OR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.28, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). Sleep habits were not different between children with behavioral problems and those without. Of the children, 16.7% experienced bodyweight gain during school closure, which was associated with behavioral problems (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.43-2.92, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and time spent watching TV/videos (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.08-1.28, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) during closure. COVID-19 school closure negatively impacted school children physically and psychologically. Screen time was associated with both physical and mental health status. Therefore, children should not engage in arbitrary screen time during school closures and should be supported in their daily routines.","Ueno, Yamamoto","https://doi.org/10.21307/sjcapp-2022-001","20220202","COVID-19; children; psychological impact; school closure; screen time; sleep habits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26436,""
"Covid-19-Related Suicides in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh: Can we Rely on Reporting System? A Rapid Systematic Review","With other life-altering changes, Covid-19 pandemic has brought a mental health crisis upon the global community. Untreated psychological disturbances can lead to tragic outcomes such as suicide. Currently, the most feasible way to know the true burden of Covid-related suicides is through media reports. However, the standards of media-reported suicide cases and their compliance to WHO checklist of suicide reporting in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh are concerning. The question that arises here is if we can truly rely on the media reporting system of these countries to establish exposure-causality relationship. We've attempted to gather the evidence of reporting sources of Covid-related suicide cases in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. We've conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines to identify the media-reported cases of COVID-related suicides. After compilation of the results, it was observed that most of the reported cases were from India (74.2%) whereas males died of suicide more often than females. When risk of bias was assessed using Pierson's method, it was observed that 70% of the studies had high risk of bias. We've attempted to gather the evidence of reporting sources of Covid-related suicide cases in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh and found that nearly all media reports hadn't followed the WHO reporting guidelines for suicide cases.

"Specchio-COVID19 cohort study: a longitudinal follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey participants in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected billions of people around the world both directly through the infection itself and indirectly through its economic, social and sanitary impact. Collecting data over time is essential for the understanding of the disease spread, the incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms, the level and dynamics of immunity, as well as the long-term impact of the pandemic. The objective of the study was to set up a longitudinal follow-up of adult participants of serosurveys carried out in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This follow-up aims at monitoring COVID-19 related symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, as well as the overall impact of the pandemic on several dimensions of health and on socioeconomic factors over a period of at least 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Serosurvey participants were invited to create an account on the dedicated digital platform Specchio-COVID19 (https://www.specchio-covid19.ch/). On registration, an initial questionnaire assessed sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics (including housing conditions, physical activity, diet, alcohol and tobacco consumption), anthropometry, general health and experience related to COVID-19 (symptoms, COVID-19 test results, quarantines, hospitalisations). Weekly, participants were invited to fill in a short questionnaire with updates on self-reported COVID-19-compatible symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection testing and vaccination. A more detailed questionnaire about mental health, well-being, risk perception and changes in working conditions was proposed monthly. Supplementary questionnaires were proposed at regular intervals to assess more in depth the impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health, vaccination adherence, healthcare consumption and changes in health behaviours. At baseline, serology testing allowed to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general population and subgroups of workers. Additionally, seropositive participants and a sample of randomly selected participants were invited for serologic testing at regular intervals in order to monitor both the seropersistance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of the canton of Geneva.

"The Opioid Crisis: Prevalence and Markets of Opioids","The US opioid crisis came in three waves - prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyls - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resulting in the deaths of nearly 500,000 people from 1996 to 2019. In 2009, drug overdose deaths exceeded those involving automobiles. Opioid overdose deaths contributed to the decrease in life expectancy for Americans from 78.8 to 78.5 during 2014 to 2017. The overprescribing of a schedule II prescription opioid was escalated by pharmaceutical companies promoting a growing belief that pain was an undertreated condition. In 2012, the number of opioid prescriptions peaked at 255 million and deaths exceeded 11,000 per year. The typical prescription opioid abuser was white, male, and 45-55 years of age. The hardest-hit states were in Appalachia and the Northeast. When an abuse-resistant formulation was introduced for OxyContin, the most prevalent prescription opioid, users turned to heroin. From the early 1980s, a new pizza delivery style of Mexican trafficking in black tar heroin infiltrated many of the same states hit hardest by prescription opioids. Heroin overdose deaths reached 14,495 in 2017. As heroin abuse increased in states supplied with black tar heroin, fentanyl-contaminated white powder heroin began to appear in the Northeast. Fentanyl was quickly followed by fentanyl analogs. While heroin deaths continued to escalate through 2017, they were soon overshadowed by fentanyl overdose deaths. Finally, prescription opioid and heroin overdose deaths started to decline in 2017, though fentanyl deaths continued to increase. In late 2019, it appeared that restrictions on transportation and travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in decreased availability of illicit drugs, but by 2020 drug abuse had escalated in many countries. Globally, heroin was the primary opioid of abuse and only a few countries - including Canada, Germany, Austria, and Belgium - have experienced a significant increase in prescription opioids. However, illicitly manufactured fentanyls are a growing problem in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.","Gardner, McGrath, Dowling, Bai","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Opioid+Crisis:+Prevalence+and+Markets+of+Opioids.","20220202","Fentanyls; heroin; opioid crisis; prescription opioids","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26441,""
"What is the Current and Future Status of Digital Mental Health Interventions?","The prevalence of mental disorders continues to increase, especially with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have evidence-based psychological treatments to address these conditions, most people encounter some barriers to receiving this help (e.g., stigma, geographical or time limitations). Digital mental health interventions (e.g., Internet-based interventions, smartphone apps, mixed realities -virtual and augmented reality) provide an opportunity to improve accessibility to these treatments. This article summarizes the main contributions of the different types of digital mental health solutions. It analyzes their limitations (e.g., drop-out rates, lack of engagement, lack of personalization, lack of cultural adaptations) and showcases the latest sophisticated and innovative technological advances under the umbrella of precision medicine (e.g., digital phenotyping, chatbots, or conversational agents). Finally, future challenges related to the need for real world implementation of these interventions, the use of predictive methodology, and hybrid models of care in clinical practice, among others, are discussed.","BaÃƒÂ±os, Herrero, Vara","https://doi.org/10.1017/SJP.2022.2","20220202","Internet-based interventions; digital mental health interventions; mixed realities; precision medicine; smartphone apps","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26442,""
"Gambling problems among Lebanese adults: Arabic-Language version of the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) scale validation and correlates","In the DSM-5, gambling disorder is recognized as the only behavioral addiction. The number of people with mental health disorders is increasing in Lebanon, especially since the economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), the most used tool in the world in terms of pathological gambling, has never been translated to Arabic, culturally adapted in a way that suits the Lebanese population and validated. This study's objectives were to validate an Arabic-language version of the SOGS and assess factors associated with probable pathological gambling among Lebanese adults. This study was carried out between February and April 2021, during the lockdown period imposed by the Lebanese government. A total of 601 individuals participated in this study by filling the online questionnaire. A factor analysis, using the principal component analysis, was performed on the SOGS scale items. The SOGS items were able to explain 73.35% of the variance, with an internal reliability of KR20Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.947 for the total scale. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the results of the factor analysis. More problematic alcohol use (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.17), and more depression (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.13) were significantly associated with higher odds of probable pathological gambling, whereas females (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.27) had significantly lower odds of probable pathological gambling compared to males. Our study validated an Arabic-language version of the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) for use in Lebanon, and showed some factors associated with probable pathological gambling (male gender, alcohol use disorder and depression). This reliable and valid version will hopefully contribute towards better screening for gambling disorder in Lebanon.","Haddad, Roukoz, Akel, Hallit","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00727-6","20220202","Alcohol use disorder; Depression; Gambling disorder; Lebanon; Pathological gambling; SOGS; South Oaks Gambling Screen","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26443,""
"Active methodologies association with online learning fatigue among medical students","Due to the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing issues, distance learning was implemented in many medical schools. Educational institutions faced the challenge of continuing to promote teaching and learning while keeping teachers and students in their homes, aiming to reduce the spread of the virus. This change compromised the students' mental health, due to the degree of exhaustion or fatigue attributed to the involvement in videoconferences, called ""zoom fatigue"". Despite the importance of zoom fatigue for medical education, it can be observed that there have not been studies on the role of the online teaching and learning process through active methodologies in the genesis of this fatigue. We aimed to assess the association of the teaching method used and the prevalence of zoom fatigue. A cross-sectional, quantitative, analytical study was carried out in Medical Schools of CearÃƒÂ¡, Brazil. Problem-Based Learning (PBL) teaching methodology is the only methodology used in the first semester and PBL together with traditional teaching, i.e., hybrid teaching, is used in the other ones. The Zoom Exhaustion &amp; Fatigue Scale (ZEF) was used, with the questions currently validated for Brazilian Portuguese. Chi-square tests were used to verify the statistical association between the measured variables and the teaching methodology. The prevalence of zoom fatigue reached 56% in students using the hybrid model, versus 41% in those using the PBL methodology, with a statistically significant difference (p valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027). The mean prevalence of overall zoom fatigue was 48%. Students using the hybrid methodology differed from PBL students by having a significantly higher frequency of feelings of wanting to be alone after a videoconference (16.9 vs. 7.1%, respectively) and needing time to be alone after a video conference (10.2 vs. 3.6%, respectively). Considering that zoom fatigue may stay with us for years beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to know and provide instructions on how to reduce video conferencing fatigue. The present study suggests that the active participation of students and the number of activities are important factors to be considered.","de Oliveira Kubrusly Sobral, Lima, Lima Rocha, de Brito, Duarte, Bento, Kubrusly","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03143-x","20220202","COVID-19; Education; Fatigue; Medical; Undergraduate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26444,""
"Mental well-being during stages of COVID-19 lockdown among pregnant women and new mothers","Pregnancy and early motherhood are sensitive times where epidemic disease outbreaks can affect mental health negatively. Countries and health care systems handled the pandemic and lockdowns differently and knowledge about how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental well-being of pregnant women and new mothers is limited and points in different directions. To investigate symptoms of anxiety and depression in a population of pregnant women and new mothers in various stages of infection pressure and lockdown during the first 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. The study population was nested an inception cohort of women recruited in their first trimester of pregnancy. Data about mental health of the woman were obtained in relation to pregnancy and child development (first trimester, 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks postpartum and 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°months postpartum), and data were analysed cross-sectionally according to calendar time (periods defined by infection rate and lock-down during the COVID-19 pandemic). No differences in reported levels of depressive symptoms between the six examined time periods of the pandemic were observed. Specifically, symptoms remained unchanged after the first lock-down. No major changes in anxiety symptoms were observed in relation to increased infection pressure or lockdowns, but a small increase was observed during the second lockdown in women 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks postpartum. No clear change in mood among pregnant women was seen between during the stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark.","Overbeck, Rasmussen, Siersma, Kragstrup, Ertmann, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04374-4","20220202","Anxiety; Covid-19; Cross-sectional; Depression; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26445,""
"The association between COVID-19-related fear and reported self-harm in a national survey of people with a lifetime history of self-harm","Relatively little is known about the characteristics of people living in the community who have previously self-harmed and may benefit from interventions during and after COVID-19. We therefore aimed to: (a) examine the relationship between reported self-harm and COVID-19-related fear, and (b) describe the characteristics of a community sample of people who reported a lifetime history of self-harm. A cross-sectional national online survey of UK adults who reported a lifetime history of self-harm (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°1029) was conducted. Data were collected May - June 2020. Main outcomes were self-reported COVID-19-related fear (based on the Fear of COVID-19 scale [FCV-19S]), lifetime history of COVID-19, and lifetime history of self-harm. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Chi-square was used to compare characteristics of our sample with available national data. Overall, 75.1, 40.2 and 74.3% of the total sample reported lifetime suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and non-suicidal self-harm respectively. When adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, social grade, and exposure to death and suicide, binary logistic regression showed higher levels of perceived symptomatic (or physiological) reactions to COVID-19 were associated with suicidal ideation (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.22, 95%CI 1.07, 1.39) and suicidal attempts (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.91, 95%CI 1.18, 12.96) in the past week. Results suggest an urgent need to consider the impact of COVID-19 on people with a lifetime history of self-harm when designing interventions to help support people in reducing suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. Experiencing symptomatic reactions of fear in particular is associated with self-harm. Helping to support people to develop coping plans in response to threat-related fear is likely to help people at risk of repeat self-harm during public health emergencies.","Keyworth, Quinlivan, Leather, O'Connor, Armitage","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03625-0","20220202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26446,""

"The national suicide prevention strategy in India: context and considerations for urgent action","India reports the highest number of suicide deaths in the world. At this time when the Indian Government is formulating a national suicide prevention strategy, we have reviewed the current status of suicides in India, focusing on epidemiology, risk factors, and existing suicide prevention strategies to identify key challenges and priorities for suicide prevention. The suicide rate among Indian girls and women continues to be twice the global rate. Suicide accounts for most deaths in the 15-39 years age group compared with other causes of death. Hanging is the most common method of suicide, followed by pesticides poisoning, medicine overdose, and self-immolation. In addition to depression and alcohol use disorders as risk factors, several social and cultural factors appear to increase risk of suicide. The absence of a national suicide prevention strategy, inappropriate media reporting, legal conflicts in the interpretation of suicide being punishable, and inadequate multisectoral engagement are major barriers to effective suicide prevention. A scaffolding approach is useful to reduce suicide rates, as interventions provided at the right time, intensity, and duration can help navigate situations in which a person might be susceptible to and at risk of suicide. In addition to outlining research and data priorities, we provide recommendations that emphasise multilevel action priorities for suicide prevention across various sectors. We call for urgent action in India by integrating suicide prevention measures at every level of public health, with special focus on the finalisation and implementation of the national suicide prevention strategy.","Vijayakumar, Chandra, Kumar, Pathare, Banerjee, Goswami, Dandona","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00152-8","20220202","Age Distribution; COVID-19; Female; Health Policy; Humans; India; Male; Pandemics; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Sex Distribution; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","",26448,""
