"Suicides During the Pandemic: A Retrospective Study","Suicide is defined as a fatal self-injurious act with some evidence of intent to die.1 Suicide occurs more often in older than in younger people, but is still one of the leading causes of death in the late childhood and adolescence. Every year, more than 1,00,000 people commit suicide in our country.1 Suicide accounts for 1.4% of all deaths, and is the 15th leading cause of death globally.2,3 Suicide is associated with an impulsive nature. Several risk factors concerning family structure and interactions have been linked to a suicidal behaviour. Direct conflicts with parents and siblings, Occupational status and social acceptance have a great impact, but so do the absence of communication and a lack of empathy.12 Interpersonal losses are also strongly associated with suicide cases. But in developing countries one of the major reason always remains unemployment and poverty. There are different rates of suicides and suicidal behaviour between males and females (among both adults and adolescents). While females more often have suicidal thoughts, males die by suicide more frequently.5 Hence, this study was planned with a purpose to know the magnitude and the socio-cultural factors of the problem of suicides, so that a sound prevention program could be suggested, planned and implemented for reducing the incidence of suicides.","Singha, Y.

"Depression and Anxiety in Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Medical students are prone to anxiety and depression, largely due to the nature of their coursework. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical students were required to study from home without being involved in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), plus possible risk factors in medical students around the world during the pandemic. A primary search was conducted using PubMed, limited to the period 2020-2021. A second search was conducted to acquire studies published before the pandemic, aiming to have a baseline prevalence value for these disorders in medical students. During the pandemic, the prevalence of depression in the USA (31.7%, 12.5%, and 10.8% for mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively) was higher than the reported prevalence in Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran, although the four countries used different psychiatric instruments, making comparison difficult (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Self-rating Depression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression [HADS-D], and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II). The prevalence of GAD in the USA was also higher (35.3%, 19.5%, and 11.1%, for mild, moderate, and severe GAD) than the prevalence in China (21.3%, 2.7%, and 0.9%, for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety), and the overall prevalence in Brazil, (46.2%), using the same instrument ( GAD-7). The prevalence of GAD in the USA was also higher than the prevalence in Nepal, Pakistan, and Iran, although the researchers used a different psychiatric instrument (HADS-A, Self- rating Anxiety Scale, and Beck Anxiety Inventory instruments, respectively). Before the pandemic, the reported prevalence of depression in the USA was lower (11.6%, 9.0%, and 3.0% for mild, moderate, and severe depression), than in Pakistan (31.0%, 13.6%, and 4.8%), using the BDI instrument. In Nepal, the prevalence of depression (5.2%) was higher than in Portugal ( 2.3%), ascertained with the HADS-D instrument. The prevalence in Egypt (65% using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale DASS-21]) and India ( 14.7%, 19%, and 17.5% mild, moderate, and severe depression, using DASS 42) were the highest prevalence values reported before the pandemic. For anxiety, the prevalence of overall GAD in Nepal (16.2%) was comparable to the one reported in Portugal ( 14.2%), both identified with the HADS-A instrument. The prevalence of GAD reported in India and in Egypt were the highest values, determined with the DASS 42 and DASS 21, respectively. Studies have reported that general social isolation and loneliness are risk factors contributing factors toward depression. Other risk factors identified with depression and/or anxiety disorders were being female, having a lower GPA, lower COVID-19 awareness, and having more experience with COVID symptoms. High prevalence of depression and GAD was identified in medical students in various countries. It is imperative that during any crisis such as the one experienced in the present COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations to mental health disorders, such as medical students, are identified and supported. Further research needs to be done to explore other possible factors, such as living conditions, marital status, social-cultural influences, financial issues, and their relationship to depression and anxiety in this population, to further understand the best interventions to support this population.","Nair, K.; Joseph, T.; Villamil, M.

"Future-Proofing Imperatives for Remote Online Teaching, Learning and Student Support in the Context of Pandemic Change and Beyond: A Case for South African Higher Education Transformation","South Africa's Plan for Higher Education identified equity and redress as key objectives guiding institutional transformation. This encompasses granting individuals fair opportunities to enter higher education and succeed therein. The COVID-19 pandemic which abruptly disrupted the 2020 academic year highlighted several challenges which have implications for student success. Academic continuity in the form of online learning was pursued by most higher education institutions. However, the remoteness of rural communities, which typifies the home environments for many South African students, threatened to exclude such students from online learning activities. The lack of access to digital devices as well as reliable internet connectivity in many of these communities impacted students' ability to engage in online learning as well as access campus-based support services. The imposed lockdown therefore caused heightened anxiety and feelings of isolation from academic activities amongst the South African student population. Since access to on-campus support systems was no longer possible, student wellness and ongoing academic engagement was potentially compromised. Increasingly, the mental health cost of remote learning was becoming apparent, with higher education institutions compelled to rethink how student support services are delivered. In the absence of face-to-face support services during the hard lock-down period, the emergent need was to identify new ways of reaching out to displaced students who may be experiencing both academic and personal distress under conditions of daunting technological changes and virtual forms of engagement, social isolation, socio-economic disadvantage and psycho-social stressors. While blended learning and hybrid forms of holistic student support were accelerated by the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, the blended approach has become an indelible reality of Higher Education that is here to stay. As such, reflections on how student support services at universities in South Africa have adapted and need to continuously evolve in the face of an uncertain world, is both timely and necessary if the goal of promoting equal access and success in Higher Education - for all -is to be fully realized.","van Staden, D.; Naidoo, P.","https://doi.org/10.20853/36-3-4122","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: South African Journal of Higher Education; 36(3):269-281, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37045,""
"Physical and Psychological Impacts on COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients of 3rd Wave","Background: COVID shelters and many emergency centers were established as a countermeasure to control this pandemic that hit the word by the end of 2019. Due to unavailability of medical care, along with physical health is-sues, these patients suffer with mental health related issues. Aims: This study aimed to explore the both, physical and psychological impacts upon the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted in intensive care units of hospitals of Pakistan during the third wave. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was performed during the peak time of COVID-19 for the duration of two months i.e. April & May 2021. After getting ethical approval from Shifa International Hopsital (Ref# 070-021), permission was sorted from public and private hospitals of Pakistan. 183 conscious patients diagnosed with COVID and currently admitted in intensive care units were randomly selected from hospitals of Islamabad and Rawal-pindi. Written consent was taken from patients and their caregivers after they were briefed regarding the importance of the study. PHQ-15 was used to assess somatic symptoms related to COVID-19 whereas DASS-21 was used to assess level of depression, anxiety and stress among patients. Results: Of 183 hospitalized patients of COVID-19 in intensive care units, 170 (92.9%) participants showed mild to severe level of somatic symptoms on PHQ-15. Shortness of breath, feeling hearth race, back pain, stomach pain, low energy and sleeping difficulties were the most common somatic complaints reported by patients. The statistics of DASS-21 showed that 51 (27.86%) participants had mild to severe level of depres-sion, 74 (40.4%) had mild to profound level of anxiety and 96 (52.45%) reported mild to profound level of stress. Conclu-sion: This study portrayed a better understanding and confirms the physical and psychological impacts upon hospitalized COVID-19 patients, therefore highlighting the need of both physical and mental health interventions to minimize these impacts.","Jamil, A.; Syed, J.; Kiyani, H.

"Modeling of adaptive counteraction of the induced biotic environment during the invasive process","Purpose is to develop a mathematical model for the analysis of a variant in the development of a population process with a non-trivially regulated confrontation between an invading species and a biotic environment. Relevance. The situation we are studying arises in invasive processes, but is a previously unexplored special variant of their development. The task of modeling is to describe the transition to a deep v-shaped crisis after intensive growth. The model is based on examples of the adaptive dynamics of a bacterial colony and the suppression of mollusk populations, carriers of dangerous parasitic diseases, after targeted anti-epidemic introduction of their antagonists. Methods. In our work equations with a retarded argument in the range of parameter values that have a biological interpretation were studied. The model uses a logarithmic form of species regulation, taking into account the theoretically permissible capacity of the medium. In the equation we included the function of external influence with flexible threshold regulation relative to the current and previous population size. Results. It is shown that the proposed form of impact regulation leads to the formation of a stable adapted population after the crisis, which does not have a destructive impact on the habitat. With an increase in the reproductive potential of an invasive species, a deep crisis becomes critically dangerous. The form of the crisis passage depends on the reproductive potential, on the size of the initial group of individuals, and also on the time of activation of the adaptive counteraction from the environment. It is established that at a sufficient level of resistance, a non destructive equilibrium is established. Conclusion. The actual scenario of sudden depression of an actively spreading population with a large reproductive r-parameter, which is caused by the delayed activity of its natural antagonists, has been studied. The threshold form of biotic regulation is characteristic of insects, the abundance of which is regulated by competing species of parasitic hymenoptera. The variant of rapid phase change considered by us in the model is relevant as a description of one of the forms of developing the body's immune response to the development of an acute infection with a significant delay. If the immune response is prematurely inhibited by the body itself, then the chronic focus of the disease persists. Examples of the dynamics of two real biological processes in experiments with biological suppression methods are given, which correspond to the invasion scenario obtained in the new model.","Perevaryukha, A.

"The ""Konselo"" Application: A mobile-based counseling app for managing students' academic stress","Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, students were required to be highly adaptive to a variety of changes in educational approaches and methods of instruction. Since the global pandemic has spread, mental health disorders in the form of high academic stress levels have become a recurring manifestation among students and as such they require appropriate treatment. However, no online counseling application focuses on handling mental health problems for students affected by the pandemic in Indonesia. In this study, the researchers developed an online counseling application, called the â€œKonseloâ€ which serves as a platform for providing counseling to students on academic stress management. This study involved 826 students spread throughout Indonesia, experts in counseling, mobile software development experts and counselors/counseling practitioners in Indonesia. Based on development needs, the data analysis techniques used includes Aiken's V coefficient testing, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Rasch Model Analysis and Single Subject Method Analysis. The study results indicate that the Konselo application is a valid, practicable and effective mobile app for providing online counseling to reduce students' academic stress. Some limitations in the development of prospective mobile-based online counseling applications may result from the focus of the problem and the counseling approach that is being used. Nevertheless, the use of this application is not limited to dealing with the problems of students who are affected by the pandemic, but rather it can be used for broader problems, in any condition, and anywhere.","Ardi, Z.; Eseadi, C.; Khairiyah, F.

"Application of unified protocol as a transdiagnostic treatment for emotional disorders during COVID-19: An internet-delivered randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been an emotionally challenging time, especially for young adults. It is associated with a substantial increase in the prevalence of mental health problems, negative symptoms, and stressful experiences that compromise well-being. In low-income countries, internet-delivered psychological services could have a remarkable impact on the populationâ€™s mental health, given the lack of mental health professionals. AIM To investigate the efficacy of internet-delivered cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)- transdiagnostic intervention for adults with emotional disorders. METHODS In this internet-delivered randomized controlled trial, 102 students with an emotional disorder (mean age = 28.20 years, standard deviation = 5.07) were randomly allocated to receive unified protocol (UP) (n = 51) or treatment as the usual intervention. Following a semi-structured clinical interview, participants completed an online survey including the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale, Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and Emotional Style Questionnaire. RESULTS The participants showed a high degree of adherence. In total, 78% (n = 40) of the experimental group participants completed the UP treatment. Considering the intention to treat procedure, the results of the analysis of covariance indicated that participants who received UP showed statistically significant changes in depression symptoms [Cohenâ€™s d = -1.50 with 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.90 to -1.10], anxiety (Cohenâ€™s d = -1.06 with 95%CI: -1.48 to -0.65), difficulties with emotion regulation (Cohenâ€™s d = -0.33 with 95%CI: -0.7 to -0.06), positive affect (Cohen's d = 1.27 with 95%CI: 0.85 to 1.68), negative affect (Cohenâ€™s d= -1.04 with 95%CI: -1.46 to -0.63), and healthy emotionality (Cohenâ€™s d = 0.53 with 95%CI: 0.09 to 0.13) compared with the control group. CONCLUSION This studyâ€™s findings highlight the potential value of transdiagnostic internet-delivered programs for young adults with an emotional disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, and expand the research examining emotional well-being improvements resulting from CBT-transdiagnostic interventions. The findings suggest that UP, which generally concentrates on reducing negative effects, can increase positive effects.","Yan, K.; Yusufi, M.

"Psychological effects of COVID 19 pandemic on nurses deployed in high risk units: A multicentre observational study","Introduction: Novel coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic continues to rage the world with enormous economic loss, sickness, and deaths. In management of infectious diseases, nurses play crucial roles in rendering care to patients by risking their own lives, going beyond their training and capacities. Frontline nurses are vulnerable for the development of diagnosable and subclinical psychological problems most often triggered with deaths of colleagues, exposure to the mass scale of deaths, perceived inability to save lives despite best efforts, lack of social supports, shift duties, and working in high-risk environment. Aim: The aim of the study is to assess the depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses working in COVID wards versus non-COVID wards. Materials and Methods: A multicenter observational study was done among 176 frontline nurses from seven different referral government hospitals. Psychological ailments were measured on validated instruments of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-42 items (DASS-42) and Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). Results: Using SPSS version 23.0, data were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-square test, with P &lt; 0.055 being considered statistically significant. On PSS, perceived stress was high in 75% of COVID ward nurses and 67% of non-COVID ward ones. On DASS-42 scale, depression, anxiety, and stress levels among nurses in the COVID-19 wards were 21.64% (n = 21), 32.98% (n = 32), and 20.61% (n = 20) compared to 17.72% (n = 14), 24.05% (n = 19), and 15.18%, (n = 12) in the non-COVID wards, respectively.

Objective: To evaluate the moderating role of teacher support on emotional regulation strategies (ERS) in the relationship between academic stressors (AS) and depressive symptoms in female university students from socioeconomically vulnerable groups. Method: 371 women between 18 and 29 years old who were in higher education completed a survey where depressive symptoms were evaluated through the PHQ-9 and the ERD through CERQ. To assess academic stressors and perception of teacher support, specific questions were designed. Results: Two indirect effect models were identified that showed that low teacher support moderated the moderation of low and medium levels of ERS planning in the relationship of â€œquality of online learningâ€ and â€œconcern for academic performanceâ€ with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The role of ERS that points to metacognitive aspects and teaching support as protective factors for this specific group against AS, mainly linked to academic performance is discussed at the end.","Labbe, Y.; Huerta, J.; Placencia, V.; Nordenflycht, A.; MorÃ¡n-Kneer, J.; Prado, S.; RodrÃ­guez, V.","https://doi.org/10.4067/s0718-48082022000100093","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Terapia Psicologica; 40(1):93-109, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37052,""
"Behavior of physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with subjective well-being and mental health in university students in Chile","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the physical activity and psychological health of university students. Objective: To analyze the physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with subjective well-being and mental health in university students in Chile. Method: Cross-sectional study in a sample of 469 students from different Chilean universities (67.4% women, M = 21.7 SD = 2.45 years). The physical activity, subjective well-being and mental health was measured. Results: Students who maintained a physically active behavior before and during the pandemic presented higher subjective well-being (men: P = 0.020;and women p &lt;0.0001) than those who were physically inactive before and during the pandemic (women M = 4, 84, SD = 1.64;men M = 4.46, SD = 1.27). Women who became physically inactive during the pandemic had fewer negative affective experiences than women who were inactive before the pandemic (F(3,293)=3.118, p=0.026). Mental health symptoms were reported less frequently in physically active than inactive students. Conclusions: Students who were physically active before and during the pandemic showed better indicators of subjective well-being and mental health than those who were physically inactive or became physically inactive during the pandemic.

This study examined the link between having a (green) garden or a green view from the main window of the home, as well as the perceived quantity and quality of neighbourhood green areas and streetscape greenery, and the self-reported change in mental well-being since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adults residing in the Netherlands (N = 521, 67% female) completed an online survey in December 2020 and January 2021. It included items on the frequency of contact with the aforementioned outdoor spaces, as well as their quantity, natural features, and quality. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the quantity of the greenery mattered, but the quality was more strongly associated with well-being. In particular, well-maintained, attractive, and varied streetscape greenery was just as relevant as a garden with diverse plants. This beneficial association between streetscape greenery and mental well-being was stronger for female participants. Understanding the benefits of the different types and characteristics of urban greenery, and who they are most relevant for, can assist policymakers and planners in designing cities that promote health and resilience.","Shentova, Ralitsa, de Vries, Sjerp, Verboom, Jana","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141610256","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(16):10256, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37054,""
"Interventional Studies on Nurses' Mental Health in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","This systematic review's primary aim is to examine the interventional studies on the mental health of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the secondary aim is to determine the interventions that can be planned for future pandemics. For this, databases were searched, and a total of 12 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included. It was determined that most of the studies were conducted online due to pandemic restrictions. The effects of the interventions (diaphragmatic breathing relaxation, emotional freedom techniques, sending motivational messages, a mobile wellness program, acceptance and commitment therapy, a neuro-meditation program, laughter yoga, gong meditation, distant Reiki, e-aid cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based breathing, and music therapy) on the parameters affecting the mental health of the nurses working actively in the COVID-19 pandemic were examined. In these studies, the interventions applied to nurses were seen to have positive results on mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic, which is a traumatic experience for healthcare professionals, shows that more interventional studies are needed to protect and improve the mental health of nurses who take care of critically ill patients during difficult times.","KÃ¶se, Selmin, Murat, Merve","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4030040","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(3):525-536, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37055,""
"Emotional Burden among Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians during the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross Sectional Study","This study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among Spanish community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. A descriptive cross-sectional quantitative study was designed. An online survey was administered to participants from 4 to 21 April 2020 using a questionnaire assessing sociodemographic information and the Spanish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Informed consent to participate was requested. Participants comprised 1162 pharmacy staff from Spain with an average age of 39.15 &plusmn;9.718, from 20 to 65 years old, of whom 83% were women, and 50.6% were married. More than half of the participants expressed symptoms of depression (62.7%) and anxiety (70.9%). An important prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms has been detected among Spanish pharmacists and pharmacy technicians during the COVID-19 lockdown. Being a woman, a non-smoker, feeling fear, feeling stress and believing that pharmacists/pharmacy technicians are very exposed to COVID-19 seem to be associated with higher HADS scores.","Baldonedo-Mosteiro, Carmen, Mosteiro-DÃ­az, MarÃ­a-Pilar, Franco-Correia, Sara, TardÃ³n, Adonina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710558","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10558, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37056,""
"Emotional Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Nursing Students Receiving Distance Learning: An Explorative Study","Social restrictions have a significant impact on higher education, especially on nursing students. The main goal of our study was to assess the emotional state of nursing students who received e-learning during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objective was instead to measure the usability and acceptability of distance learning systems. A cross-sectional survey design was used to assess the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-year undergraduate nursing students attending the University of Messina, Italy, using an anonymous online questionnaire. The data of 522 nursing students were examined. All participants completed the online questionnaire, declaring the good usability of e-learning education (SUS mean 68.53 ds: 16.76). Moreover, we found that high levels of satisfaction in the use of the means of distance learning (based on the SUS score) were positively correlated with low levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and mental distress. In conclusion, the present study provided relevant information on usability and mental distress related to e-learning and use in a sample of nursing students. It was found that students generally found this method to be good for use. Although e-learning can be a valuable and usable teaching tool, the study suggests that students prefer a blended or presence modality, based on their perception of learning. So teaching nursing students in the future could integrate the two ways to enhance learning. Further studies are needed to evaluate this aspect.","Manuli, Alfredo, Maggio, Maria Grazia, La Rosa, Gianluca, Gregoli, Vera, Tripoli, Daniele, FamÃ , Fausto, Oddo, Valentina, Pioggia, Giovanni, CalabrÃ², Rocco Salvatore","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710556","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10556, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37057,""
"How Did People with Functional Disability Experience the First COVID-19 Lockdown? A Thematic Analysis of YouTube Comments","People with functional disability endure barriers to health and other services and to full participation in social life. In the context of COVID-19, this discrimination has been intensified worldwide. We examine how the experience of COVID-19 lockdown was depicted in comments to a video about functional disability and COVID published on VICE's YouTube channel. We analysed the first 100 comments on the video, which was posted in spring 2020, during the first COVID-19 lockdown (roughly from March to June 2020, with some variations around the world). We identified four themes: lack of access to care and services, isolation and lifestyle changes, mental health consequences, and peer support. Legal regulations regarding COVID-19 and people with functional disability have not been sufficient in most countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inadequate care systems, even in Western countries with advanced social protection policies.","Hall, Karen A.

"The Psychological Impact and Influencing Factors during Different Waves of COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers in Central Taiwan","Background: This study aims to explore differences of psychological impact and influencing factors that affected Taiwanese healthcare workers (HCW) during the first and second wave of COVID-19. Methods: a cross sectional survey of first-line HCW during November 2021 to February 2022: 270 paper questionnaires were issued and the valid response rate was 86% (231). For statistical analysis, descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multivariate linear regression were used. Results: regardless of the wave of the pandemic, nearly 70% of HCW had anxiety, nearly 60% felt depressed, half of them suffered from insomnia, and one in three felt insufficient social support, which means a high level of loneliness. With an increased number of infected patients during the second wave, HCW felt significant changes of workload and schedule, with higher concern over risk of infection, and these factors induced higher levels of anxiety, but they manifested better satisfaction over public health policies and information provided by hospitals and governments. Changes of working schedules or duties positively relate to levels of anxiety and insomnia. The risk of infection causes anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Workplace relationships significantly relate to depression and loneliness. A negative family support causes an adverse psychological impact. Conclusions: the pandemic has a negative psychological impact on HCW. Early recognition of significant influencing factors, providing psychological support and therapy, are helpful strategies for reducing the adverse psychological effects.","Sun, Teh-Kuang, Chu, Li-Chuan, Hui, Chun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710542","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10542, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37059,""
"Has Smartphone Use Influenced Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan?","The influence of smartphone use on increased risk of feeling lonely has been recognized as a global public health concern. However, it is unclear whether this influence has changed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, during which smartphones have become a particularly important means of communication due to health safety measures restricting personal interactions. We used Hiroshima University's online survey data collected from 18&ndash;28 February 2022, to assess the impact of smartphone use on loneliness in Japan. The final sample included 2630 participants aged over 20 years, with loneliness measured using the UCLA scale and smartphone use calculated as the duration of usage in minutes/day. Weighted logit regression analysis was used to examine the association between smartphone use and loneliness, with other demographic, socioeconomic, and psychological characteristics as explanatory variables. Contrary to conventional evidence, our findings show that smartphone use mitigated the risk of loneliness during the pandemic. This was especially true among females under 65 years old. We found that age, subjective health status, future anxiety, and depression impacted this relationship. The findings of this study can help guide policymaking by showing the importance of providing adequate digital platforms to manage loneliness and mental health during times of isolation.","Nguyen, Trinh Xuan Thi, Lal, Sumeet, Abdul-Salam, Sulemana, Yuktadatta, Pattaphol, McKinnon, Louis, Khan, Mostafa Saidur Rahim, Kadoya, Yoshihiko","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710540","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10540, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37060,""
"Safety Culture and the Positive Association of Being a Primary Care Training Practice during COVID-19: The Results of the Multi-Country European PRICOV-19 Study","The day-to-day work of primary care (PC) was substantially changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Teaching practices needed to adapt both clinical work and teaching in a way that enabled the teaching process to continue, while maintaining safe and high-quality care. Our study aims to investigate the effect of being a training practice on a number of different outcomes related to the safety culture of PC practices. PRICOV-19 is a multi-country cross-sectional study that researches how PC practices were organized in 38 countries during the pandemic. Data was collected from November 2020 to December 2021. We categorized practices into training and non-training and selected outcomes relating to safety culture: safe practice management, community outreach, professional well-being and adherence to protocols. Mixed-effects regression models were built to analyze the effect of being a training practice for each of the outcomes, while controlling for relevant confounders. Of the participating practices, 2886 (56%) were non-training practices and 2272 (44%) were training practices. Being a training practice was significantly associated with a lower risk for adverse mental health events (OR: 0.83;CI: 0.70&ndash;0.99), a higher number of safety measures related to patient flow (Beta: 0.17;CI: 0.07&ndash;0.28), a higher number of safety incidents reported (RR: 1.12;CI: 1.06&ndash;1.19) and more protected time for meetings (Beta: 0.08;CI: 0.01&ndash;0.15). No significant associations were found for outreach initiatives, availability of triage information, use of a phone protocol or infection prevention measures and equipment availability. Training practices were found to have a stronger safety culture than non-training practices. These results have important policy implications, since involving more PC practices in education may be an effective way to improve quality and safety in general practice.","Silva, Bianca, OÅ¾vacic AdÅ¾ic, Zlata, Vanden Bussche, Pierre, Van Poel, Esther, Seifert, Bohumil, Heaster, Cindy, Collins, Claire, Tuz Yilmaz, Canan, Knights, Felicity, de la Cruz Gomez Pellin, Maria, Astier PeÃ±a, Maria Pilar, Stylianou, Neophytos, Gomez Bravo, Raquel, Cerovecki, Venija, Klemenc Ketis, Zalika, Willems, Sara","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710515","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10515, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37061,""
"A Qualitative Investigation of the Impact of COVID-19 on United States' Frontline Health Care Workers and the Perceived Impact on Their Family Members","Although previous research has documented the mental and physical health impacts that COVID-19 had on frontline health workers in the United States, little is known about how the pandemic affected their families. This study sought to explore the impact COVID-19 had on the individual functioning of frontline health care workers in the USA and the perceived impact it had on their family members during the initial nine months of the pandemic. More specifically, this study sought to explore if and how family roles, routines, rules, and social-emotional well-being changed as a result of COVID-19. Twenty-eight frontline health care workers across the United States who were parents to at least one child residing in the home under 24 were interviewed. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. From the analysis, three major themes emerged with regard to the changes and perceived impact to family functioning, family experiences of new hygiene practices, and stigma related to being a health care practitioner or having a family member working in health care.

"A Cross-Sectional Study to Examine the Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers in Kuwait","In this study, we aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers to determine the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and well-being, and to identify the factors associated with adverse psychological effects. This study was conducted 5 months into the COVID-19 pandemic. We used an online questionnaire to collect data from 378 healthcare workers. To examine the psychological impact, three standardized questionnaires were utilized. This includes the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the WHO Well-Being Scale (WHO-5) to measure depression, anxiety, and quality of life, respectively. More than half of the participants (52.9%) exhibited moderate or high levels of depression, and 40.5% reported moderate or high levels of anxiety. Unmarried HCWs reported more severe levels of depression;moderately severe depression (24.0% vs. 16.1%) and severe depression (12.4% vs. 6.8%). Unmarried HCWs also reported more severity of anxiety as well as lower overall wellbeing. Understanding how personal factors such as marital status can influence the degree of psychological distress can allow us to make better investments in supporting the mental health needs of HCWs in Kuwait. Governments and organizations must establish protective measures, such as continually assessing the mental health status of HCWs throughout the pandemic and providing support services for HCWs in need to minimize adverse consequences and ensure optimal health system operation.","AlKandari, Sarah, Salman, Ahmad, Al-Ghadban, Fatima, Ahmad, Rasheed","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710464","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(17):10464, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37063,""
"A Study on the Relationship between Depression Change Types and Suicide Ideation before and after COVID-19","Background: The purpose of this study is to explore and categorize changes in depression, and investigate the relationship between suicidal ideations before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this study, data from the Korea Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS) was used and included 8692 adults, 19 years of age or older, who could estimate the change in depression from 2017 (12th) to 2021 (16th) for final analysis. Depression change was classified into two types, 'low-level ascending' type (n = 7809, 80.9%), and 'increasing after reduction' type (n = 883, 10.2%). The Firth Method was used to examine the relationship between depression change types and suicidal ideation. Results: The lower the equivalized annual income and the lower the educational level, and the likelihood of belonging to the 'increasing after reduction' type, compared to the 'low-level ascending' type, the greater the probability of having suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The significant impact of socioeconomic status (income and educational background) on suicidal ideation indicates the need to consider how epidemics affect inequality in society. This study is expected to provide a deeper understanding of depression, as well as to establish a foundation for long-term prevention of the rapid increase in suicide rates after COVID-19.","Kim, Sunghee, Son, Hye-Gyeong, Lee, Seoyoon, Park, Hayoung, Jeong, Kyu-Hyoung","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10091610","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(9):1610, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37064,""
"The Association between Active Mobility and Subjective Wellbeing during COVID-19 in MENA Countries","Objective: To augment the international scientific approach to raising public mental health through active lifestyle among adults, we added the evidence of the association between physical activity and subjective wellbeing in the Middle East and North Africa region by emphasizing the mediator-COVID-19. This study aimed to identify the correlations between active mobility and subjective wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample from Tabriz, Iran, which has not yet been tackled in previous study. Methods: We finalized an online survey (N = 603) from adults between 5 June and 15 July 2021. This group reported their individual and socio-economic characteristics and their perception features and location (e.g., home, work) during COVID-19. The paper developed three ordinal logistic regression (OLR) models to examine the association between active mobility types such as commute, non-commute, frequency of active travel to parks and services per week, and different subjective wellbeing including: 1- life satisfaction, 2- feeling energetic, and 3- peaceful mind while controlling for socio-economic variables (e.g., age, gender, education, job, and income) and objective commute distance. We also incorporated the most relevant objective (street length, land-use mix, number of intersections, and building and population density) and subjective (perceived distance to different services, perceived walking places, and perceived facilities attractiveness) factors. Results: Positive response relationships between four types of physical activity levels and subjective wellbeing scores were demonstrated in all of the three developed models (with significant levels of 0.05, and 0.1) with appropriate model fits, which confirmed the existing literature. However, these relationships showed different patterns (varied significant levels) for each type of subjective wellbeing. In addition, the factors including street length (p value: 0.004), perceived walkable places (p value: 0.021, 0.068, 0.017, and 0.025) (positively), population density, and perceived distance to shopping malls (p value: 0.076, &lt;0.0001, and 0.059 (negatively) were associated with different indicators of subjective wellbeing. Conclusion: As for the implication of our study, special actions by urban authorities such as increasing mixed-use and creating attractive places will be required to enhance the walkability of the neighborhoods. Moreover, notifying the adults regarding the benefits of physical activity is much more needed.","Ranjbarnia, Behzad, Kamelifar, Mohammad Javad, Masoumi, Houshmand","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10091603","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(9):1603, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37065,""

To assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being of the community of Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Pakistan), a cross-sectional study design was used to find out depression and anxiety after the first wave of the pandemic. A total of 320 willing individuals participated in the study. Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. Demographic information along with a semi-structured interview, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Life Event Scale-Revised, and Center of Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale were used as measures. The participants of this study were bifurcated into affected (n = 151) and none affected (n = 169) on the basis of the impact of life event cut-off scores. Results Data analysis was carried out using t-test and simple linear regression analysis. Results of t-test showed that the pandemic-affected individuals (47%) reported significantly high on the depression and anxiety scores. The verdicts from simple linear regression analysis further demonstrate a history of psychiatric illness, duration of quarantine, and impact of event predicting depression (R (2) = .15, p &lt; .001). For anxiety history of psychiatric illness, the impact of life events were significant predictors (R (2) = .28, p &lt; .001) whereas the duration of quarantine, death due to COVID-19, and Impact of Event Scale predicted the center of epidemiological studies for depression (R (2) .48, p &lt; .001). The finding of the research study concluded that 47% participated individuals were affected due to the pandemic COVID-19.

Findings Beyond merely platform orientation and operating procedure familiarisation, the team gained insights into ensuring optimal learning, engagement and participant experience during online deliveries. Delivery of online SBE brings several potential barriers to psychological safety and these warrant careful consideration by experienced simulationists. Practical implications Optimising participant engagement and psychological safety remain key considerations despite this novel medium. Facilitators must be willing to adapt accordingly to begin delivering high-quality online SBE. Originality/value From their experience, facilitators must reframe their debriefing expectations and adjust how they engage participants and manage group dynamics given the inherently different nature of this new learning environment.","O'Sullivan, O.

"Assessing explanatory variables of perceived stress to disaster: implications for risk research","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to increase social, economic, and psychological risks, including increased perceived stress - or the degree to which a person perceives a stressor and their ability to cope with it. The current study uses novel data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the role of a range of demographic and disaster-related experiential variables on perceived stress (n = 744). Hierarchical linear regression indicates that women experience greater perceived stress than men and as age and educational attainment increase, perceived stress decreases. Respondents experiencing rent/mortgage stress, job loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, anticipated reliance on others, and worry about ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on their physical health, the economy, and personal relationships also experience increased perceived stress. Results provide empirical evidence of risks stemming from the multiple concerns (i.e., financial, psychological, and physical health) of U.S. residents regarding the COVID-19 disaster. Findings indicate the need for policy and legislative actions, such as the U.S.-wide eviction moratorium, to support individuals suffering from multiple impacts from the pandemic and to reduce perceived stress and its attendant risks including increased incidents of posttraumatic stress and depression.","Cannon, C.

"A review of resilience in higher education: toward the emerging concept of designer resilience","Higher education (HE) students experience rates of depression and anxiety substantially higher than those found in the general population. Many psychological approaches to improving wellbeing and developing student resilience have been adopted by HE administrators and educators, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. This article aims to review literature regarding integration of resilience and wellbeing in HE. A subsequent aim is to scope toward developing foundations for an emerging discipline specific concept - designer resilience. A literature scoping review is applied to chart various conceptual, theoretical and operational applications of resilience and wellbeing in HE. Twenty-seven (27) articles are identified and analysed. The scoping review finds that two general approaches to implementing resilience and wellbeing training exist in HE. First, articles reacting to a decline in student mental health and remedying this decline through general extra-curricular resilience or wellbeing programmes. Second, articles opting for a curricula and discipline-specific approach by establishing why resilience will be needed by future graduates before developing and testing new learning experiences. The presence of cognitive flexibility, storytelling, reframing and reflection lie at the core of the practice of resilience and design and therefore offer preliminary opportunities to develop 'designer resilience' training. Future research opportunities are identified throughout the article.","Price, R.

"ESKD Patient Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey Study","End stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are vulnerable to medical and psychosocial difficulties. We aimed to identify specific concerns for ESKD patients during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were administered to adult ESKD patients receiving dialysis in three units run by a large dialysis organization affiliated with an academic nephrology practice. Multiple choice and open-ended questions were used to assess patientsâ€™ perceptions of access to care and essentials of daily living, and effects of changes in dialysis schedules or prescriptions. Screening questions were used to assess patient anxiety and depression. 172 ESKD patients on dialysis were surveyed. Participants on home dialysis modalities [peritoneal dialysis (PD) or home hemodialysis (HHD)] more commonly reported feeling â€œvery connectedâ€ to their dialysis care teams compared to patients on in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) (PD: 74.1%;HHD: 66.7%;ICHD: 62.3%). Patients who identified as White more commonly reported feeling â€œvery connectedâ€ compared to patients who identified as non-White (White: 74.4%;Black/African American: 60.5%;Hispanic: 69.6%). Patients with histories of anxiety or depression more commonly reported feeling less cared for during the pandemic. 16.9% of participants reported new transportation issues, 6.4% reported difficulty obtaining medications, and 9.3% reported difficulty getting groceries. A minority of patients met screening criteria for depression or anxiety, though patients with self-reported histories of anxiety or depression had higher screening scores. Five themes emerged as influencing patient experiences: 1) the positive influence of relationships with dialysis staff;2) the value of interactions with family or other caretakers;3) difficulties with access to care;4) changes in physical and mental health;and 5) awareness of, and response to, the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study identifies sub-populations of ESKD patients who may be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic: those with histories of anxiety or depression, non-White patients, and patients on ICHD. Use of home dialysis modalities may be associated with better patient perceptions of care.","Patel, D.; Noce, E.; Zorzanello, M.; Aklilu, A.; Anders, E.; Bernal, M.; Sundararajan, A.; Dahl, N.; Kodali, R.","https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.01.343","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Journal of Kidney Diseases; 79(4):S103, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37072,""
"KDQOL Survey Scores in Dialysis Patients Decrease Following the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic With Concurrent Changes in Patient Adherence","The Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) survey is a review of patientsâ€™ quality of life (QOL) on hemodialysis. Lower survey scores in depression, burden of disease, and treatment satisfaction are associated with worse compliance to treatment and poorer outcomes. KDQOL surveys were extracted from and stratified by year, with duplicate entries removed. Annual mean scores for each component of the survey were calculated for each clinic. The KDQOL data represents the mean scores for 2017-2019 compared to the first three quarters of 2021. 2020 was excluded due to sampling challenges and high patient turnover creating potentially inaccurate data. Mean scores were compared by Studentâ€™s t-test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiplicity. Phosphorus and PTH levels were used as a surrogate for treatment compliance. Patients reported lower QOL scores during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic (baseline). All KDQOL metrics were significantly lower in 2021 compared to the mean of three years prior to the pandemic. A two sample Studentâ€™s T test was used to determine the change in mean score for each category: Physical Component Score (t(2)= 14.5, p=0.009), Mental Component Score (t(2)= 36.7, p=0.0004), Burden of Kidney Disease (t(2)= 6.1, p=0.01), Symptoms of Kidney Disease (t(2)= 22.8, p=0.0009), Effects of Kidney Disease (t(2)= 8.8, p=0.006). Phosphorus was significantly higher in 2021 compared to the mean of 2018 and 2019 when calculated via t-test (t(31)= -2.72, p=0.01). Parathyroid Hormone quarterly data was evaluated via t-test for 2018 to 2020 vs. the first three quarters of 2021 (t(12)= -7.15, p=0.01) Using the KDQOL survey to measure patientsâ€™ QOL, we found that all measures were significantly lower in 2021 following the pandemic. Using markers of bone metabolism as measures of treatment compliance, phosphorus and PTH levels were also significantly higher in 2021. In ESRD patients who survived the trauma of the pandemic, QOL is perceived to be worse and is likely affecting compliance. Social workers and staff need to be aware of these trends to provide the appropriate counselling and resources to meet the needs of these patients.","Coritsidis, G.; Fullmer, J.; Weiss, S.; Alias, M.","https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.01.331","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Journal of Kidney Diseases; 79(4):S99-S100, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37073,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Healthcare: Findings From the Joslin COVID-19 Study","The COVID-19 pandemic limited health care access for individuals with multiple chronic medical conditions. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and quality of health care in patients with chronic comorbidities such as DM, HTN and CKD. An online survey was sent to patients over the age of 18 years who have been seen at Joslin during the last 24 months. Surveys were sent to participants by Redcap or conducted through telephone. The survey consisted of 92 items that included COVID diagnosis, General Health, Home self-care, Vaccines, Exposure to COVID, Health- care access and delivery, Perceptions of healthcare quality during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pregnancy, Mental well-being, Diet and lifestyle, and demographics. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). As of November 1, 2021, 1189 had completed the survey. The mean age of participants was 54.2 Â± 17.3 years. Half were women, and 89.2% were White. One hundred-six reported to have had COVID-19 infection;94% had diabetes, 36% had HTN, and 8% had CKD. An income of &lt; $50,000 was reported in 9% and 39% were college graduates. While half of the CKD participants felt COVID-19 made their quality of healthcare â€œworse or a lot worseâ€, 81% of the participants with CKD felt that their doctors were available to meet their healthcare needs. In addition, the majority of the CKD participants reported to have access to all of their medications during the pandemic. About 48% reported COVID-19 outbreak has negatively affected their mental health with 21% and 11% screened positive for anxiety and depression respectively. Results were similar in patients with CKD. Individuals with depression and anxiety were, more likely to be women and obese. Fifteen percent of the participants with depression and 10.6% with anxiety responded that COVID-19 made the quality of healthcare a lot worse compared to 3.6% in individuals with no depression and 3.3% with no anxiety respectively (p&lt;0.001).

"Urology residency training during the pandemic A review of the current literature","Introduction & Objectives: On March 11, 2020, WHO declared Covid-19 as a pandemic placing a significant strain on the worldwide healthcare system. Although urology does not stand at the frontline of care for patients with Covid-19, every practicing urologist has been affected by the global outbreak. The objective of this review is to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on urology residency training programs. Materials & Methods: We performed a literature review of the current evidence on urology residency training during the Covid-19 pandemic. Relevant databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library) were searched (until June 2021) and the main study-inclusion criterion was the presence of residentsâ€™ or directorsâ€™ opinion on their residency training program during the Covid-19 crisis. Results: Literature search identified 72 articles. 14 studies comprising a total of more than 2500 residents were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. During the pandemic, learning activities carried out by urology residents suffered a forced modulation. There has been a decrease in operation volume especially in procedures in which residents were directly involved. Similarly, there was a decline in most of the academic activities worldwide. Furthermore, the negative impact on residentsâ€™ mental well-being and lifestyle is reported by many studies. On the other hand, the lockdown stressed the opportunity to review the current training system and to increase the implementation of tools such as telemedicine and smart-learning surgical skill training programs. Conclusions: Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes in urology residency programs worldwide, with a negative impact on matters such as surgical training and academic activities. Residentsâ€™ well-being and mental health is also risked. Hopefully, this unprecedented situation has generated new online learning modalities and technological innovations in the field of training in urology","Stamatakos, P.

"PATIENTS REFERRED TO ANORECTAL MANOMETRY BEFORE AND DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC: ARE THEY DIFFERENT?","Background and aim: The SARS-CoV 2 pandemic has provoked drastic lifestyle changes and distracted the attention of doctors and patients towards â€œurgentâ€ diseases. Consequently, it could have influenced also the features of the patients referred to a â€œnonurgentâ€ diagnostic test such as anorectal manometry (ARM). The aim of this study was to evaluate possible differences in the features of patients undergoing ARM before and during the pandemic. Materials and methods: Demographic and clinical information was collected in 388 patients (m 99, f 289;mean age:53 Â± 16.4 years) undergoing ARM according to the London Protocol from July to December 2019 (154 pts.), 2020 (101 pts.), 2021 (133 pts.). Information was collected using also dedicated scales: HADS, PACSYM, ODS, SF-12 and Wexner. Results: The indications for ARM were chronic constipation, fecal incontinence, chronic anal pain, evaluation after rehabilitation or before surgery. No difference was detected regarding indications and demographic features in the three different periods apart from the following: - duration of symptoms: in 2019, there was a lower prevalence of long-lasting symptomatology (&gt;10 years) compared to 2020 and 2021 (p = 0.029). - ODS score (constipated patients): mean ODS score was lower in 2020 (11.22 Â± 4.37) and in 2021 (10.89 Â± 4.64) than in 2019 (14.82 Â± 5.09) (p &lt; 0.01). - HADS score mean values were always below the cutoff for diagnosing anxiety or depression. However, the mean score of depression was lower in 2020 (6.64 Â± 3.24) and 2021 (5.16 Â± 4.62) than in 2019 (7.58 Â± 4.84) (p &lt; 0.05). Manometric diagnostic conclusions were not significantly different in the three periods. Conclusions: The features of patients referred to a manometric evaluation were quite similar before and after the pandemic. The pandemic could have partially selected the patients with a long-lasting symptomatology, more prevalent in 2020 and in 2021. The slight differences we detected in the ODS and HADS scores may be related to lifestyle changes imposed by the forced lockdown, which resulted in changes in bowel habits. Our results are different from those reported in the literature regarding a worsening of functional disorders during pandemic. ARM is a niche exam and cannot be considered a mirror of functional disorders because they are very prevalent in the general population, while there are very few patients who undergo ARM. A multicenter study that can validate our conclusions is desirable.","Lambiase, C.; Rettura, F.; Pancetti, A.; Morganti, R.; Berti, G.; Baiano Svizzero, F.; Mariani, L.; Stefani Donati, D.; De Bortoli, N.; Bellini, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658(22)00439-X","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Digestive and Liver Disease; 54:S144, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37076,""
"Psychosocial impact of 6 months of treatment with SymkeviÂ® among adult cystic fibrosis patients","Objectives: Research has shown that patients with CF and their families have an increased risk of anxiety and/or depression. This substudy, part of a multicentre observational trial, investigated the psychosocial impact of 6 months of treatment with SymkeviÂ® in adult CF patients. Methods: The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R), Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) were completed at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with SymkeviÂ®. Results: Of 42 subjects (median age: 29.3 years;28M/14F) included in the initial trial, 21 patients completed the CFQ-R and 25 patients completedthe GAD-7 and PHQ-9. The scores in the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were not significantly different between baseline and 6 months (p = 0.55;p = 0.51, resp.). No significant differences were observed between the CFQ-R domains except for ""social functioning."" For this domain, the median scores improved from median 55.56% (IQR: 50.00%;73.61%) to 72.22% (IQR: 65.28%;83.33%) (p = 0.001). Patients with an increased social functioning also had an increased FEV1 after 6 months (p = 0.02). Conclusion: These findings indicate that 6 months of treatment with SymkeviÂ® improves social functioning among adult CF patients.We did not see a difference in anxiety or depression.

"Cystic fibrosis, lockdown and CFTR modulators - a perfect storm","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people. A large scale survey undertaken by the NHS in July 2020 showed 1 in 6 children aged 5â€“16 had a probable mental health disorder compared to 1 in 9 in 2017. The TIDES study showed that young people with cystic fibrosis have a 2â€“3 times higher risk for anxiety and depression than the general population. There are also increasing reports of adverse mental health effects with CFTR modulators. We present the case of an adolescent girl with cystic fibrosiswho struggled with mental health issues since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This escalated during repeated lockdowns and on starting KaftrioÂ® in late 2020. Despite a beneficial effect initially on her lung function, her mental health deteriorated further and she was acutely admitted to a medical ward in spring 2021 with significant depression and passive suicidal ideation. She had lost 10% of her body weight in 3 months and had a nearly 20% drop in FEV1 in 5 months. Her escalating mental health condition lead to her being sectioned under the mental health act. We discuss the complexities of this case, managing a joint psychiatric and medical patient on an acute medical ward and the legalities of trying to ensure she had good cystic fibrosis care while under a mental health act section. Legally, the mental health act only covers treatment for mental health conditions but she was using non-compliance with CF care as a method of self-harming. We discuss the potential negative impact of KaftrioÂ® on her mental health and how we stopped and then slowly increased her dose using sweat tests and monitoring her mental health. Despite the challenges involved, her mental and physical health improved through coordinated working with all the teams involved in her care.","Hufton, M.; Hussaini, Y.; Desai, M.; Saleem, N.; Srikantaiah, R.; Fairbank, J.; Cooper, S.; Paskin, L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1569-1993(22)00271-5","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 21:S40, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37078,""
"Impact of Trikafta on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores","As new therapies emerge for cystic fibrosis (CF), it is important to understand their psychiatric implications. Studies have shown cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators to be associated with worsening of depression and anxiety symptoms. TrikaftaÂ® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) is a newly-approved CFTR modulator that significantly improves lung function, decreases pulmonary exacerbations, and improves the quality of life. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of TrikaftaÂ® on anxiety and depression. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of TrikaftaÂ® on PHQ-9 (depression screening questionnaire) and GAD-7 (anxiety screening questionnaire), scores in adult patients with CF seen at an academic health centre in the Southeastern United States. Methods:We conducted a retrospective chart review of 127 adult patients with CF who initiated TrikaftaÂ® between (11/2019 to 08/2021). We gathered data, including demographic information (age, sex, race, CF mutation), annual PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, corresponding FEV1 percent predicted, BMI, mental health diagnoses, counseling/psychotherapy use, psychiatric medication use, prescriber of those medications, number of psychiatric emergency department visits and psychiatric admissions, and sleep disturbances. We then ran linear mixed models examining the effect of TrikaftaÂ® on PHQ- 9 and GAD-7 scores after controlling for timing with respect to the COVID- 19 pandemic. Results: Of the 127 adult patient charts reviewed,100were included. These patients yielded 562 PHQ-9 and 562 GAD-7 scores taken from 01/2015â€“01/ 2022. No change in PHQ-9 scores was found after initiating TrikaftaÂ® or after the beginning of COVID (designated as March 15, 2020). Similarly, GAD-7 scores showed no significant change after TrikaftaÂ® or COVID. Table 1.

"Real-world use of different pembrolizumab regimens (3 weekly versus 6 weekly) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients","Background and objectives: Pembrolizumab monotherapy given 3-weekly (3w) (200mg) is approved for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In June 2019, NICE endorsed the 6w regimen (400mg) based on computer modelling data (Lala, Eur J Cancer 2020), which has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce hospital visits. This study compared immune-related adverse events (irAEs), discontinuation rates, and patient experience of 3w vs 6w patients treated at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. Methodology: Pharmacy records were used to identify NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab, 1st, 2nd or 3rd line. IrAEs and discontinuation rates were analysed using Kaplan Meier curves to compare the 3w vs 6w cohorts. A sample of the cohort who received 3w then 6w undertook a questionnaire assessing patient experience. Results: 38 patients received pembrolizumab 6w, and 91 received pembrolizumab 3w, of the 3w, 51 switched to 6w. Baseline characteristics were similar. Any grade irAEs and G1-2 irAEs were significantly higher in the 6w cohort (p=0.006 and p=0.04, respectively). Both cohorts showed low rates of G3-5 irAEs at 6 months, 2.3% vs 14.5%, 3w vs 6w, p=0.3. Discontinuation rates at 6 months due to any irAES, G1-2 irAEs or G3-5 irAEs were insignificant in both cohorts (3w to 6w respectively): 4.5% vs 11.2%, p=0.2;2.8% vs 8.7%, p=0.4;2.0% vs 2.5%, p=0.3. Quality of life questionnaires showed stability (60%) or improvement (20%) in the 6w cohort compared to 3w. 90% said their mental health did not differ between regimens. 45% and 40% of patients preferred 6w and 3w respectively, 15% had no preference. Conclusion: NSCLC patients treated with 6w pembrolizumab appear to experience more low-grade irAEs compared to 3w. Highgrade irAEs and discontinuation rates due to irAEs were insignificant in both cohorts. Patients preferred the 6w regiment and found it tolerable.","Osborne, L.; Ortega-Franco, A.; Hodgson, C.; Pearce, M.; Moss, A.; Lindsay, C.; Hughes, S.; Taylor, P.; Califano, R.; Rafee, S.; Gomes, F.; Summers, Y.; Blackhall, F.; Cove-Smith, L.; Halkyard, E.; Fenemore, J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5002(22)00144-1","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Lung Cancer; 165:S46, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37080,""
"Reported safety of HCV direct-acting antivirals with opioids: 2017 to 2021","Background and aims: As a result of disengagement in addiction care during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a record increase in mortality associated with opioid overdoses (primarily fentanyl), particularly in North America. In the USA there were over 100, 000 overdose deaths in 2021, while over 2000 were recorded in the province of British Columbia. As we attempt to develop novel ways to increase HCV treatment following =30% declines during the pandemic, we evaluated publicly available adverse events (AEs) reports for opioids and DAAs to assess whether safety concerns from potential drug interactions arewarranted, particularly amongst those using fentanyl. Method: Data were downloaded from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Public Dashboard. AEswith the DAAs glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), sofosbuvir/ velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), sofosbuvir/ velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX), andelbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/ GZR) listed as the suspect product were analyzed with an initial received date from July 28, 2017-December 31, 2021, as were opioidassociated AEs for all 2017â€“2021. Subsequently, AEs were counted based on listed concomitant use of opioids (fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone), or overdose outcomes irrespective of concomitant opioid use. Data are descriptivewithout any statistical analyses. Results: In the reporting period, 40 total AEs were recorded with concomitant DAA and fentanyl use, 14 resulting in death (G/p = 3, SOF/VEL = 11;Table 1);626 total AEs were recorded with concomitant DAA and oxycodone or hydrocodone use, 28 resulting in death. Separately, overdose events were reported 196 times, 32 resulting in death. The number of overdoses declined each year from 2018 (N = 56) to 2021 (N = 29). Fentanyl AEs showed no trend year to year. Table 1: FAERs AEs and deaths with opioids and with concomitant HCV DAAs. (Table Presented) *N represents the sum of fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydrocodone overdose AEs and deaths, whereas nâ€™s for DAA overdose AEs and deaths are irrespective of concomitant opioids. Conclusion: With the limitations of FAERS data (under or duplicate reporting, inability to establish causation or incidence), these data showthat among ~58, 000 fentanyl, ~189, 000 oxycodone, and ~100, 000 hydrocodone AEs reported to FAERS since 2017, a small proportion (0.19%) have been reported in association with concomitant DAA therapy, with no association between recorded events and a specific DAA regimen. This should reassure HCV treaters on a lack of safety signal for concomitant opioid and DAA use.","Martinez, A.; Khan, T.; Dylla, D.; Marcinak, J.; Collins, M.; Saget, B.; Conway, B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-8278(22)01509-4","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Hepatology; 77:S596, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-06","",37081,""
"Temporal changes in patient-reported outcome measures stratified by liver fibrosis severity in large-duct primary sclerosing cholangitis","Background and aims: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used as exploratory end points in clinical trials. The aim of this studywas to evaluate the temporal relationship between health-related quality of life (HrQoL) and liver fibrosis using generic (SF-36) and disease-specific (PSC-PRO) tools. Method: Patients with large-duct PSC were invited to complete HrQoL questionnaires in an outpatient setting at baseline (V1) and follow-up (V2) visits at least 12 months apart. Transient elastography liver stiffness (LS;Echosens, France) measurementswere recorded on the same day. SF-36 and PSC-PRO health domains were scored out of a maximum of 100% and 5, respectively. Mean scores were calculated for each domain with lower SF-36 and higher PSC-PRO scores representing poorer quality of life. Advanced fibrosis (F3-6) was defined based on published cutoff of LS &gt;9.6kPa in PSC. Results: Fifty-five patients (64% male) with median age 45 years (range: 20â€“77) and median PSC duration 11 years (range: 2â€“26) attended both study visits. The median time between visits was 417 days (range: 362â€“582). The mean scores were numerically lower at V2 than V1 in all the SF-36 domains but only three domains showed statistically significant difference: bodily pain (74% vs 83%, p &lt; 0.01), energy/fatigue (47% vs 57%, p &lt; 0.0001), and mental summary score (66% vs 71%, p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in any of the PSCPRO domains between the visits. When stratified by baseline LS &gt;9.6 kPa threshold (Figure 1), SF-36 physical functioning mean score dropped in the F3-6 group but increased slightly in the F0-2 group (-9.0 Â± 17% vs 0.4 Â± 21%, p = 0.01). In the PSC-PRO, the emotional impact mean score increased in the F3-6 group but decreased in the F0-2 group (0.6 Â± 0.7 vs -0.1 Â± 0.5, p &lt; 0.01). Therewere no significant differences in mean scores in the other domains between the visits.(Figure Presented)Conclusion: Therewasworsening of bodily pain, levels of energy and mental health even within a year in patients with large-duct PSC. Patients with advanced fibrosis reported lower physical functioning and higher emotional impact of their disease compared to those without advanced fibrosis. Changes in PROMs are related to liver fibrosis and need to be considered in future antifibrotic drug trials. These findings, however, need to be interpreted in the context of imposed restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic which may have had a significant psycho-social impact on patients.","Selvaraj, E.; Collier, J.
