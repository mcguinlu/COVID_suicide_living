"Social relationships and depression during the COVID-19 lockdown: longitudinal analysis of the COVID-19 social study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic led to social and physical distancing measures that reduced social contact and support. We explored whether people with more frequent and supportive social contact had fewer depressive symptoms during the UK Spring 2020 lockdown, whether this applied to face-to-face and remote electronic contact, and whether people with higher empathy levels, or more frequent pre-COVID social contact with others were more protected. Methods UK dwelling participants aged 18 or older in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to 22 weekly questionnaires about frequency of face-to-face and phone/video social contact, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms assessed with the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed linear models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined for interaction by empathic concern and perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency. Results In 71,117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15) we found that daily face-to-face or phone/video contact was associated with lower PHQ-9 scores (mean difference 0.258 (95% confidence interval 0.225, 0.290) and 0.117 (0.080, 0.154) respectively) compared to having no contact. Those with high social support scored 1.836 (1.801, 1.871) PHQ-9 points lower than those with low support. The odds ratio for depression for those with daily face-to-face social contact compared to no face-to-face contact was 0.712 (0.678, 0.747). Daily compared to no phone/video contact was associated with odds ratio for depression 0.825 (0.779, 0.873). And reporting high, compared to low, social support was associated with 0.145 (95%CI 0.138, 0.152) odds ratio for depression. The negative association between social relationships and depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual sociability. Conclusions Those who had more face-to-face contact during lockdown had fewer depressive symptoms. Phone or video communication were beneficial but less so. People who were usually more sociable or had higher empathy were more likely to have depressive symptoms during enforced reduced social contact. Results have implications both for our management of COVID-19 and potential future pandemics, and for our understanding of the relationship between social factors and mental health.","Andrew Sommerlad; Louise Marston; Jonathan Huntley; Gill Livingston; Gemma Lewis; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20241950","20201203","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7749,""
"Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of adults with mental health conditions in the UK: A qualitative interview study","Background People with mental health conditions have been identified as particularly vulnerable to poor mental health and wellbeing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, why this population have faced these adverse effects, how they have experienced them and how they have coped during the pandemic remains under-explored. Aims To explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of people with existing mental health conditions, and to identify protective factors and coping strategies applied to support positive mental health. Method Semi-structured qualitative interviews and thematic analysis with 22 people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Results Five pandemic related factors contributed to a deterioration in mental health: i) feeling safe but isolated at home ii) disruption to mental health services, iii) cancelled plans and changed routines iv) uncertainty and lack of control, and v) rolling media coverage. Five coping strategies and protective factors were identified for maintaining mental health: i) previous experience of adversity ii) feeling less accountable to others iii) engaging in hobbies and activities, iv) staying connected with others, and v) perceived social support. Conclusions Particular challenges were identified that were a direct result of the pandemic and people with severe mental illnesses were particularly negatively affected. However, some participants found this period a time of respite, were able to draw upon reserves of resilience and adapt their coping strategies to maintain positive wellbeing.","Alexandra Burton; Alison McKinlay; Henry Aughterson; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20241067","20201203","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7750,""
"Does living close to petrochemical complex increase the adverse psychological effects of COVID-19 lockdown?","The petrochemical industry has made possible the economic development of many local communities, increasing the employment opportunities and generating a complex network of secondary industries closely related to those. However, it is known that petrochemical industries emit air pollutants, which are related to different negative effects on mental health. In addition, many people around the world are being exposed to highly stressful situations derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown adopted by the national and regional governments. The present study was aimed at analysing the possible differential effects on different psychological outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression and emotional regulation strategies) derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown in individuals living near an important petrochemical complex and subjects living in other areas, non-exposed to the characteristic environmental pollutants emitted by this kind of complexes. The sample was composed by 1607 subjects which respond a questionnaire developed ad hoc about the confinement conditions, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The results indicated that people living closer to petrochemical complexes reported greater risk perception. However, no significant relationships between psychological variables and proximity to the focus were detected when compared people living near to or far away from a chemical/petrochemical complex. Regarding the adverse psychological effects of the first lockdown due to COVID-19 on the general population in Catalonia, we can conclude that the lockdown conditions included in this survey were mainly related to changes in the impulsivity levels of participants. However, we can also suggest that the economic effects are going to be harder than those initially detected in this study. More studies are necessary to corroborate our results.","Paloma Vicenns; Luis Heredia; Edgar Bustamante; Yolanda Perez; Jose Luis Domingo; Margarita Torrente","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20241711","20201203","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7751,""
"Impact of the Great Recession on mental health, substance abuse and violence in families with children: a systematic review of the evidence","Objectives This review summarises the existing evidence on the effects of the Great Recession on mental health, substance use and violence in families with children and discusses the policy and service-system implications of this evidence  Methods Peer-reviewed articles published in English between January 2010 and August 2020 were identified through a systematic search of the main scientific databases, citation records, and manual searches of individual journal sites  Studies focusing on children, or their parents, that included an exposure variable measuring the Great Recession and had an outcome related to mental health, substance use or violence were included  A risk of bias assessment and narrative synthesis were provided  Results In total 41 studies were analysed  Most of the studies were deemed to have a moderate risk of bias (30), nine had a high risk of bias and two had a low risk of bias  High-quality studies provided evidence that the economic recession of 2008 (termed â€˜the Great Recessionâ€™ in this paper) did hurt childrenâ€™s mental wellbeing  The evidence regarding substance use in families with children was scarce but there were some indications that the recession increased drug and alcohol use among economically vulnerable subgroups  Studies with individual level data from the US showed that the Great Recession increased the risk of child maltreatment, but little evidence of this was found in several ecological and population level time-trend analyses  Implications Counter-cyclical investments in and further integration of social, education and health services targeted not only at adults but also at families with children are crucial in alleviating human suffering in economic recessions  Subsequent research with the combination of high-quality individual and aggregated level data is warranted to assess the potential effects of recessions on substance use and violence in families with children  During the unprecedented economic changes following the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to monitor timely mental health, substance use and violence in families at risk","Hiilamo, Aapo, Hiilamo, Heikki, Ristikari, Tiina, Virtanen, Petri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105772","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Children and Youth Services Review;: 105772, 2020.; Publication details: Children and Youth Services Review;: 105772, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7752,""

"Covid19 lockdown impact on cognitions and emotions experienced during sexual intercourse","Objectives: To study the impact of COVID19 lockdown on cognitions and emotions felt during sexual intercourse by analyzing the responses of 1079 French-speaking subjects (338 men, 741 women, median age: 31 years) who participated in an online survey between April 27 and May 11, 2020  Method: Negative sexual cognitions (NSC), positive sexual emotions (PSE) and negative sexual emotions (NSE) are assessed using a tool inspired by the Sexual Mode Questionnaire  Data are crossed with sociodemographic indicators, information on lockdown modalities, indices on sex life, information on psychological functioning and sexual satisfaction  Main Results: One third of the participants saw a decrease in the frequency of their sexual activities or in their sexual satisfaction  Changes in NSCs were found in 74 4% of subjects (increase: 38 4%;decrease: 36%)  Emotional changes are found in between 50 7% (NSC: increase: 20 2%;decrease: 30 5 %) and 60 9% (PSE: increase: 24 6 %;decrease: 36 3%) of participants  The effect of lockdown on NSC, NSE, and PSE depends on gender at birth, intensity of depressive symptoms, and attachment styles  Women appear to be more vulnerable to lockdown than men  Insecure or depressed subjects also appear more vulnerable  The lockdown impact also depends on changes in the frequency of physical/digital intercourse during lockdown and the modalities of confinement  Changes in NSC, NSE, and PSE had a significant effect on sexual satisfaction during lockdown  Conclusion: The lockdown impact on sexual emotions and cognitions is non-negligible and greater than the impact on sexual behaviors  Whether it is positive or negative, it asks about the post-confinement repercussions: what becomes of a positive impact with deconfinement?

"Entrepreneurial bricolage in the aftermath of a shock Insights from Greek SMEs","The world has seen several waves of economic crises, which have had a severe impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), such as the Great Depression of the 1930s, the financial crisis in the late 2000s and, most recently, the global COVID-19, because they strip SMEs from their much needed resources  Prior research suggests that SMEs use bricolage to cope with such negative external shocks  While there is a rich discussion on how SMEs carry out their bricolage processes, the literature provides little empirical evidence on what actually happens in times of crisis  To examine whether the SME bricolage process described in the literature is consistent with how SMEs use bricolage when they face a business environment crisis, we conducted a qualitative study of six SMEsâ€™ response to the austerity measures of the bailout programme for Greece, scheduled by the EU, ECB and IMF, which were known to have unambiguously led to the deterioration of the SME business environment  We found that bricolage occurred across all SMEsâ€™ activities as expected  However, contrary to the literature, we found that bricolage did not lead the strategic approach of any of the investigated SMEs  Rather, bricolage was integrated within their overall strategy  Furthermore, we found that how the bricolage is unrolled depends on the SME sector  With this knowledge, the present study suggests policymakers need to adjust their support system towards enabling resource-constrained SMEs to deal with the aftermath of negative shocks in their business environment","Tsilika, Theodora, Kakouris, Alexandros, Apostolopoulos, Nikolaos, Dermatis, Zacharias","https://doi.org/10.1080/08276331.2020.1764733","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship;32(6):635-652, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship;32(6):635-652, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7759,""

"Levels and Factors Associated with Resilience in Italian Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Survey","Background: Resilience is defined as the capacity to cope successfully with change or adversity  The aims of our study were to investigate levels of resilience in Italian healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to identify potential predictors of resilience  Methods: We performed a web-based survey of HCPs (n = 1009) working in Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic  The survey contained a 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms  Non-HCP individuals (n = 375) from the general population were used for comparison  Results: HCPs showed significantly lower resilience compared to the control group (p = 0 001)  No significant differences were observed after stratification for geographical area, work setting, role, or suspected/confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19  In a linear regression analysis, RS14 was inversely correlated with depression (R2 = 0 227, p &lt;0 001) and anxiety (R2 = 0 117, p &lt;0 001) and directly correlated with age (R2 = 0 012, p &lt;0 001) but not with body mass index (BMI, R2 = 0 002, p = 0 213)  In male HCPs, higher depression score (odds ratio (OR) 1 147, p &lt;0 001) or BMI (OR 1 136, p = 0 011) significantly predicted having low resilience  In female HCPs, higher depression score (OR 1 111, p &lt;0 0001) and working in a COVID-19 free setting (OR 2 308, p = 0 002) significantly predicted having low resilience  HCPs satisfied with personal protective equipment had higher levels of resilience (p &lt;0 010)  Conclusions: Our findings suggest that resilience was lower in Italian HCPs than in the general population after the first COVID-19 wave  Specific factors can be identified, and targeted interventions may have an important role to foster resilience of HCPs","Lisi, Lucia, Ciaffi, Jacopo, Bruni, Antonella, Mancarella, Luana, Brusi, Veronica, Gramegna, Pasquale, Ripamonti, Claudio, Quaranta, Elisabetta, Borlandelli, Elena, Gallo, Gaetano, Garofalo, Eugenio, Chiaravalloti, Agostino, Viola, Pasquale, Ruscitti, Piero, Caio, Giacomo, Dâ€™Onghia, Martina, Dâ€™Amuri, Andrea, Cimellaro, Antonio, Facchini, Giancarlo, La Regina, Micaela, Spinardi, Luca, De Giorgio, Roberto, Giacomelli, Roberto, Landini, Maria Paola, Berardi, Domenico, Meliconi, Riccardo, Ursini, Francesco","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs10120183","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences;10(12):183, 2020.; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences;10(12):183, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7769,""

"A mixed methods investigation into the experiences, attitudes and needs of Baby Buddy pregnancy and parenting app users during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of expectant parents and parents of young babies, with disruption to healthcare provision and loss of social support. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 and associated lockdown on this population through the lens of users of the UK, NHS-approved pregnancy and parenting smartphone app, Baby Buddy. The study aims were threefold; firstly to gain insights into the attitudes and experiences of expectant and recent parents (babies under 24 weeks old) during the COVID-19 pandemic; secondly to investigate whether Baby Buddy is meeting the needs of its users at this time and thirdly to identify ways in which Baby Buddy could revise content to better support its users both now and in the future. A mixed methods study design combining an online survey with semi-structured telephone interviews amongst Baby Buddy users in the UK was applied. Data collection ran from April 15th to mid-June 2020, corresponding to weeks 4 to 13 of UK in lockdown. A total of 436 expectant (n=244) and recent (n=192) parents responded to the online survey, of which 79% (345) were aged 25-39 years and 17% (n=75) spoke English as a second language. Over 88% (n= 386) reported increased levels of anxiety around pregnancy, birth and being a new parent, and 60% (n=253) were concerned about their own emotional and mental health. Over 45% (n=106) of pregnant respondents were concerned about their physical health. Telephone interviews (n=32) amongst pregnant (n=13) and recent parents (n=19) revealed similarly increased levels of anxiety due to reduced healthcare provision and loss of support from friends and family. Whilst a minority identified some positive outcomes of lockdown, such as family bonding, many telephone interviewees reported feeling isolated, disregarded and overwhelmed. Recent parents were particularly anxious about the effects of the lockdown on their baby's development and socialisation. Many interviewees were also concerned about their physical health, as a consequence of both limited access to face-to-face medical appointments, and their own poorer dietary and physical activity behaviours. Across both samples, over 90% (n=423) of respondents reported that Baby Buddy was helping them currently, with many commenting that its role was even more important given the lack of face-to-face support from healthcare and parenting organisations. Greater speed in updating digital content to reflect changes brought about by the pandemic would have been appreciated. The COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened anxiety and stress amongst expectant parents and those with a young baby, and for many, lockdown has had an adverse effect on physical and mental wellbeing. With a reduction in healthcare and social support, expectant and new parents are increasingly relying on online resources. As an evidence-based and free app, Baby Buddy is well positioned to meet this need. It could support its users even more by actively directing them to the wealth of existing content relevant to their concerns, and by adding content to give users the knowledge and confidence to meet the new challenges facing them.","Rhodes, Kheireddine, Smith","https://doi.org/10.2196/23157","20201202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7781,""
"Randomized Controlled Trial of Mindfulness - Based Intervention For Student Depression, Anxiety and Stress: Observations on a Disrupted Campus","Background: University students are experiencing higher levels of distress and mental health disorders. In addressing mental health needs, web-based interventions have shown increasing promise to overcome geographic distances and high student-to-counselor ratios, leading to the potential for wider implementation. The Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC) program, a web based program, guided by mindfulness and cognitive behavioural therapy principles, is among efforts aimed at effectively and efficiently reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in students. Objective: This study's aim was to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week MVC program in reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress (primary outcomes), and improving mindfulness (secondary outcome) in undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. Guided by two prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that each demonstrated efficacy when conducted during regular university operations, the current study coincided with a university-wide labour strike. Nonetheless, the students' response to an online mental health program on a disrupted campus can provide useful information for anticipating the impact of other disruptions, including those related to COVID-19, currently and in a foreseeable future. Methods: In this parallel arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), 154 students were randomly allocated to an 8-week MVC intervention (n= 76) or a waitlist control (WLC) condition (n= 78). The MVC intervention included (1) educational and mindfulness video modules, (2) anonymous peer-peer discussions, and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally-guided, 20-min videoconferences. Study outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 8-week follow-up using: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Generalized estimation equations with an AR(1) covariance structure were used to evaluate the impact of intervention, with outcome evaluations performed on both an intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) basis. Results: Participants (n= 154) included 35 males and 117 females with a mean age of 23.1 years. There were no statistically significant differences at baseline between MVC and WLC on demographics and psychological characteristics, indicating similar demographic and psychological characteristics across the MVC-WLC groups. Results under both ITT and PP approaches indicated that except for PSS (ITT: ÃŽÂ²= -2.31, P= .03; PP: ÃŽÂ²= -2.38, P= .03), there were no statistically significant between group differences in PHQ-9 (ITT: ÃŽÂ²= -0.44, P= 0.64; PP: ÃŽÂ²= -0.62, P= .053), BAI (ITT: ÃŽÂ²= -2.06, P= .31; PP: ÃŽÂ²= -2.32, P= .27), and FFMQ-SF (ITT: ÃŽÂ²= 1.33, P= .43; PP: ÃŽÂ²= 1.44, P= .41) compared to WLC. Conclusions: During a university labour strike, the MVC program led to statistically significant reductions in PSS compared to WLC, but no other significant between group differences. Comparisons with previous cycles of intervention testing, undertaken during non-disrupted university operations, when efficacy was demonstrated, are discussed.

"Lymphocyte Subset Alteration and Monocyte CD4 Expression Reduction in Patients with Severe COVID-19","The spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, related to cellular immune functions, has not been fully clarified yet. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the alteration of peripheral blood cells in patients with COVID-19. The flow cytometric characterization of immune cell subset was performed on 69 COVID-19 patients and 21 healthy controls. These data were evaluated based on the disease severity. A total of 69 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were classified as asymptomatic infection (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14), nonsevere (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39), and severe (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16) groups. Decreased lymphocytes and increased CD14Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°4- monocytes are found in patients with severe COVID-19. Decreased CD4 expression level was observed in the monocytes of patients with severe COVID-19. The total lymphocytes, B and T lymphocytes, CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells, and natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells were found to be decreased in patients with severe COVID-19. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was not significantly different between patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls. The percentage of activated T cells (CD3+HLA-DR+) and B cells (CD19+CD38+) was lower in patients with severe COVID-19. Age and CD4- monocytes were independent predictors of disease severity.

"[Pandemic COVID-19: what about patients with mental health disorders?]","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major challenge for the general population. What about people already suffering from mental health problems? We describe the results of a regular survey conducted on patients undergoing treatment in an outpatient psychiatric clinic. The goal was to determine their experience of the first wave of the pandemic, its impact on the meaning of their lives and their spirituality and the types of support (medical and other) they receive. The results highlight that the role of outpatient treatment (sometimes the only assistance provided when containment measures are put in place) is important for a large number of patients. Overall, these data justify and inform the continuation of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment during the pandemic period.

"Prevalence of symptoms of temporomandibular disorders, oral behaviors, anxiety, and depression in Dentistry students during the period of social isolation due to COVID-19","Temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), anxiety, and depression are disorders that, due to the current lifestyle, are affecting an increasing portion of the population. Investigating the prevalence of the symptoms of these disorders during the quarantine due to the coronavirus 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) is important to outline clinical strategies for patient care. This study assessed the prevalence of TMD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and oral behaviors and their associations during the social isolation due to COVID-19. Questionnaires were used to assess TMD symptoms in accordance with the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders: clinical protocol and assessment instruments, a questionnaire to verify oral behaviors and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in students of dentistry at the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of BrasÃƒÂ­lia in May 2020. Qualitative data were subjected to descriptive statistics and chi-squared analysis (p&lt;0.05). The relationship between quantitative and qualitative data was evaluated using Spearman's rho correlation (p&lt;0.05). There was a high prevalence of TMD symptoms, anxiety, and depression in the participants, resulting in association between gender and anxiety symptoms (p=0.029). There was a positive correlation between oral behaviors and TMD symptoms (r=0.364; p&lt;0.001), between oral behaviors and anxiety symptoms (r=0.312; p=0.001), and between oral behaviors and symptoms of depression (r=0.216; p=0.021). Social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the prevalence of TMD symptoms, anxiety, and depression.","Medeiros, Vieira, Silva, Rezende, Santos, Tabata","https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-7757-2020-0445","20201202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7785,""

"How the Italian Nursing students deal the pandemic Covid-19 condition","Since December 2019, a new infectious disease known as Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has rapidly spread globally until it has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. At the same time, if we consider the University context, there is little attention paid during basic nursing education to emergency response, and faculty members report feeling poorly prepared to teach students about this topic. The present study aims to investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic condition influenced the psychological well-being of the Italian nursing students. An online questionnaire was administered to Italian nursing students which contains two parts: a demographic section and the assessment to the psychological well-being nursing student with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Given the emergency health situation from Covid-19, our initial concern was to find a large number of students with difficulties in mentally processing this situation even with problems such as depression, as their future profession is heavily involved in the management of this pandemic. Fortunately our results have denied our initial hypothesis since both the impact management levels of the event, assessed with the IES-R scale, and the depression levels, assessed with the PHQ-9 recorded values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹that were almost normal. Nursing students are better able to face the situation since they find themselves in the role of spectators and not in the role of actors in the care of patients with Covid-19. If the training ameliorates psychological well being, therefore, it is necessary to provide and preserve nurses expertise to encourage teaching in nursing degree courses on maxi emergencies to prepare future nurses to face them adequately.","Vitale, Moretti, Noternicola, Covelli","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i12-S.9860","20201202","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7787,""

The outbreak and spread of the disease has caused fear, insecurity and anxiety in people around the world. The pan - de mic has both direct and indirect effects on mental health problems, as fear of the virus can trigger or exacerbate mental illness and influence the onset of symptoms. Case studies suggest that this emergency can affect the content of delusions and hallucinations, as well as contribute to psychotic relapse. In addition to a brief review of the literature, we describe the case of three psychotic patients of the Jahn Ferenc South Pest Hospital, Centre for Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine, whose delusions and hallucinations were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health","The current worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has changed the modus operandi of all segments of society. While some pandemic-related stressors affect nearly everyone, many especially affect women. Ã‚Â To review what is known about the pandemic's effect on women's mental health, what makes them more predisposed to vulnerabilities and adverse impacts, and strategiesÃ‚Â for preventing and treating these mental health consequences in the female population during specific stages across the lifespan. Ã‚Â The authors performed a narrative review in combination with their observations from clinical experience in the field of women's mental healthÃ‚Â and reproductive psychiatry. Articles on women's mental health and COVID-19 up to May 30, 2020, were searched using the electronic PubMed and PsychInfo databases, as well as publications by major health entities (e.g., World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations) and press releases from prime communication outlets (e.g., National Public Radio). Ã‚Â Women who are pregnant, postpartum, miscarrying, or experiencing intimate partner violence are at especially high risk for developing mental health problems during the pandemic. Proactive outreach to these groups of women and enhancement of social supports could lead to prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment. Social support is a key protective factor. Similarly, parenting may be substantially more stressful during a pandemic. Gender disparities may be accentuated, particularly for employed women or single parents, as women are disproportionately responsible for the bulk of domestic tasks, including childcare and eldercare.","Almeida, Shrestha, Stojanac, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-020-01092-2","20201202","COVID-19; Intimate partner violence; Pandemic; Reproductive psychiatry; womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7789,""

"Teacher's Physical Activity and Mental Health During Lockdown Due to the COVID-2019 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led teachers to an unpredictable scenario where the lockdown situation has accelerated the shift from traditional to online educational methods, and relationships have been altered by the avoidance of direct contact with the others, with implications for their mental health. Physical activity seemed to be a factor that could prevent mental disorders such as anxiety or depression in this peculiar situation. Therefore, the aims of this study were to explore how teachers have been affected by the lockdown with respect to their mental health and their relationships in three main fields: work, family, and social relationships, and to know which is the role of physical activity in the mentioned variables. For that purpose, an online survey was designed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Results showed that indoor physical activity acts as preventive in lockdown situations, whereas the level of activity does not affect mental health. Also, teachers have experienced higher levels of distress due to the workload generated during the lockdown. In conclusion, to prevent health problems among teachers in future similar situations, it would be important to facilitate the practice of physical activity at home. Furthermore, teacher training in blended or online educational methods would be crucial for their favorable work development.","Aperribai, Cortabarria, Aguirre, Verche, Borges","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577886","20201202","COVID-19; lockdown; mental health; physical activity; teacher","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7791,""
"Psychological Pathways Linking Public Trust During the Coronavirus Pandemic to Mental and Physical Well-being","The well-being of the public during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is deeply rooted in institutional trust in the government's risk communication effort. The objective of this study was to examine the psychological pathway through which public trust in the government is associated with mental and physical well-being. We collected cross-sectional data from 501 participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years using an online panel. Public trust in the government was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for psychological distress by combining the Patient Health Questionnaire and the General Anxiety Disorder scale. Physical well-being was examined using self-rated health. We further assessed the roles of risk perceptions. The author conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlations, multivariable regressions, and mediation analyses (using the Preachers and Hayes' approach). Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% Caucasian/white with a mean age of 32.44 Ã‚Â± 11.94 years. Public trust in the government regarding COVID-19 was negatively correlated with psychological distress (<i>r</i> = -0.20; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and positively associated with physical well-being (<i>r</i> = 0.13; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, public trust remained negatively associated with psychological distress (ÃŽÂ² = -0.19; 95% confidence intervals, [CI] -0.30, -0.09) and positively associated with physical well-being (ÃŽÂ² = 0.26; 95% CI [0.16, -0.37]). Perceived self-efficacy to practice COVID-19 protective behavior partially mediated the relationship between public trust and psychological distress (13.07%); and physical well-being (28.02%). Perceived self-efficacy to protect self against COVID-19 infection can serve as a psychological pathway through which public trust may be associated with mental and physical health.","Olagoke, Olagoke, Hughes","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.570216","20201202","coronavirus disease; mental health; perceived self-efficacy; physical health; public trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7792,""
"The Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Well-Being and Psychological Distress: Impact Upon a Single Country","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have affected the psychological well-being and mental health of many people. Data on prevalence rates of mental health problems are needed for mental health service planning. Psychological well-being and prevalence of clinically significant mental distress were measured in a large sample from Wales 11-16 weeks into lockdown and compared to population-based data collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using an online survey disseminated across Wales and open to adults (age 16+) from 9th June to 13th July 2020. Psychological well-being was indexed <i>via</i> the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, and psychological distress was indexed <i>via</i> the K10. Data from 12,989 people who took part in this study were compared to that from April 2018 - March 2019, gathered by the National Survey for Wales (<i>N</i> = 11,922). Well-being showed a large decrease from 2019 levels. Clinically significant psychological distress was found in around 50% of the population (men = 47.4%, women = 58.6%), with around 20% showing &quot;severe&quot; effects (men = 17.0%, women = 20.9%): a 3-4-fold increase in prevalence. Most affected were young people, women, and those in deprived areas. By June-July 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic had dramatic effects on the mental health of people living in Wales (and by implication those in the UK and beyond). The effects are larger than previous reports. This probably reflects that the current data were taken deeper into the lockdown period than previous evaluations. Mental health services need to prepare for this wave of mental health problems with an emphasis on younger adults, women, and in areas of greater deprivation.","Gray, O'Connor, Knowles, Pink, Simkiss, Williams, Snowden","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.594115","20201202","COVID-19; K10; Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS); mental disorder; mental health; psychological distress; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7793,""

"Why psychiatry is different - challenges and difficulties in managing a nosocomial outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in hospital care","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was officially declared a pandemic in March 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 are nosocomial, but to the best of our knowledge, no nosocomial outbreaks on psychiatric departments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in Europe. The different nature of psychiatry makes outbreak management more difficult. This study determines which psychiatry specific factors contributed to a nosocomial outbreak taking place in a psychiatric department. This will provide possible interventions in future outbreak management. A case series describing a nosocomial outbreak in a psychiatric department of an acute care hospital in the Netherlands between March 13, 2020 and April, 14 2020. The outbreak was analyzed by combining data from standardized interviews, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The nosocomial outbreak in which 43% of staff of the psychiatric department and 19% of admitted patients were involved, was caused by healthcare worker (HCW)-to-HCW transmissions, as well as patient-to-HCW-to-patient transmission. We identified four aspects associated with the mental health care system which might have made our department more susceptible to an outbreak. Infection control measures designed for hospitals are not directly applicable to psychiatric departments. Psychiatric patients should be considered a high-risk group for infectious diseases and customized measures should be designed and implemented. Extra attention for psychiatric departments is necessary during a pandemic as psychiatric HCWs are less familiar with outbreak management. Clear communication and governance is crucial in correctly implementing these measures.","Rovers, van de Linde, Kenters, Bisseling, Nieuwenhuijse, Oude Munnink, Voss, Nabuurs-Franssen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-020-00853-z","20201202","COVID-19; Hospital outbreak management; Hospital psychiatry; Nosocomial outbreak","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7795,""
"Behavioural and Emotional Changes during COVID-19 Lockdown in an Italian Paediatric Population with Neurologic and Psychiatric Disorders","On 11 March 2020, a national lockdown was imposed by the Italian government to contain the spread of COVID19 disease. This is an observational longitudinal study conducted at Fondazione Stella Maris (FSM), Italy to investigate lockdown-related emotional and behavioural changes in paediatric neuropsychiatric population. Families having children (1.5-18 years) with neuropsychiatric disorders referred to FSM have been contacted and proposed to fulfil two online questionnaires (General questionnaire and Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL)) to (i) compare (paired two-sample <i>t</i>-tests) the CBCL scores during lockdown with previous ones, and (ii) investigate the influence (multiple linear regression models) of variables such as age, diagnosis grouping (neurological, neurodevelopmental, emotional, and behavioural disorders) and financial hardship. One hundred and forty-one parents fulfilled the questionnaires. Anxiety and somatic problems increased in 1.5-5 years subpopulation, while obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic and thought problems increased in 6-18 years subpopulation. In the regression models, younger age in the 1.5-5 years subpopulation resulted as &quot;protective&quot; while financial hardship experienced by families during lockdown was related to psychiatric symptoms increasing in the 6-18 years subpopulation.

"Problematic internet use among young and adult population in Bangladesh: Correlates with lifestyle and online activities during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Although internet use can boost individualsâ€™ quality of life in various aspects, activities on the internet (e.g., gambling, video gaming, social media use, pornography use, etc.) can be used as coping strategy to deal with psychological stressors and mood states (e.g., fear, anxiety, depression) particularly during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives The present study assessed problematic internet use (PIU) among Bangladeshi youth and adults in Bangladesh and examined its correlation with lifestyle and online activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was utilized between May and June 2020 comprising 13,525 Bangladeshi individuals (61.3% male; age range 18â€“50 years; mean age 23.7 years) recruited from various online platforms. The self-report survey included questions concerning socio-demographics, lifestyle, and online activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as psychometric scales such as the nine-item Internet Disorder Scale-Short Form (IDS9-SF). Results Utilizing hierarchical regression analysis, problematic internet use was significantly and positively associated with those who were younger, having a higher level of education, living with a nuclear family, engaging in less physical exercise, avoiding household chores, playing online videogames, social media use, and engaging in recreational online activities. Conclusions Excessive internet use appears to have been commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic period and young adults were most vulnerable to problematic internet use.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100311","20201201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7798,""

"Adverse and Benevolent Childhood Experiences Predict Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer adult mental health, and benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) are associated with better adult mental health. Objective. To test whether ACEs and BCEs predict adult mental health beyond current stress and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting. We analyzed data from undergraduate and graduate students (N = 502) at an urban private university in the western United States. Methods. An online survey was conducted to assess ACEs and BCEs, current stress and social support, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness in May 2020. Results. Higher levels of ACEs were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, ÃŸ = 0.45, p = .002. Higher levels of BCEs were associated with lower depressive symptoms, ÃŸ = -0.39, p = .03, lower perceived stress, ÃŸ = -0.26, p = .002, and less loneliness, ÃŸ = -0.12, p = .04. These associations held while controlling for current stress, social support, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions. Childhood experiences are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. BCEs should be considered an important promotive factor, independent of ACEs, for psychological well-being during a global public health crisis. BCEs should be included along with ACEs in future research and screening with distressed and vulnerable populations.","Jenalee Doom","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A6-C2F-979","20201203","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; pandemic; depression; benevolent childhood experiences; covid-19; anxiety; perceived stress; mental health; social support; loneliness; adverse childhood experiences; stress; adversity; positive childhood experiences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-03","",7800,""
