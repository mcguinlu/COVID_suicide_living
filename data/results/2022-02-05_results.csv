"An audit of waiting times in the outpatient clinic in Inverness Sector A NHS Highland during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims This audit was to assess and improve the organizational efficiency of referrals to Inverness Sector A Outpatient Service. The referrals were audited to measure the average waiting time from referral to first offered outpatient appointment and to assess the proportion of patients waiting longer than 12 weeks. Method The audit included routine referrals to the CMHT Inverness Sector A, NHS Highland from GP practices: Kingsmills, Burnfield, Riverside, Fairfield, Foyers and Drumnadrochit Medical Practices. The number of referrals and the number and proportion of clients given appointments for assessments were calculated. Referrals were received directly from primary care and the Mental Health Liaison Team or following Out of Hours contacts at the Mental Health Assessment Team. Data were collected retrospectively: referrals from 1 Jan 2020â€“31 Aug 2020. Sample size came to 160 patients aged 16â€“65 years. Data were collected via review of recorded documentation on the NHSH electronic patient record systems (SCIstore), from 5thâ€“25th January 2021. Result 160 patients (male 82, female 78) were referred from 1 Jan to 1 Sept 2020. Of these, 140 (87.5%) were given an appointment for an assessment. The mean waiting time was 12 weeks for 103 patients (64%), with 57 patients (36%) waiting longer than 13 weeks. The bimodal distribution of waiting times prompted an analysis of those with longer waiting times. In some instances, appointments were delayed because patients either did not attend (DNA) or cancelled their appointments. Reasons for delays included: postponement until further information was available;cancellation of meetings or patients DNA. In 20 cases (12.5%), the referrals deemed inadequate, prompting further liaison with the referrer for clarification about the nature of the problem and previous psychological interventions. Conclusion The number of transactions (any amendment to a patient record) was higher than the number of patients affected, as several transactions can relate to one patientsâ€™ record. Most referrals are vetted in advance via the daily Inverness triage huddle. Ways of improving the quality of information provided by referrers would be explored. On receipt of each referral, the date of the 12 week deadline would be calculated and highlighted in a database. The cross-sector (Highland wide) standardisation will add clarity about medical capacity, that does not involve use of excessive clinician time.","Zinchenko, Oksana, Hyland, Jennifer","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+audit+of+waiting+times+in+the+outpatient+clinic+in+Inverness+Sector+A+NHS+Highland+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S113-S113, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26473,""
"Family Socioeconomic Status and Chinese Preschoolersâ€™ Anxious Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Roles of Parental Investment, Parenting Style, Home Quarantine Length, and Regional Pandemic Risk","Using data from 16,161 families with target child of 3-6 years old in Hubei, China during COVID-19 pandemic, this study examined the association between family socioeconomic status (SES) and preschoolersâ€™ anxious symptoms (PAS). Parental investment and parenting style were tested as mediators for this association. Home quarantine length was tested as a moderator for this direct association and for the associations between family SES and parenting processes, whereas regional pandemic risk was tested as a moderator for the entire model. Results support the utility of Family Stress and Family Investment Models in a Chinese context by identifying unique roles of parental investment and parenting style in mediating the link between family SES and PAS. Quarantine length moderated the link between family SES and authoritarian parenting: Strength of this negative association was stronger for families with longer quarantine than for those with shorter quarantine. Further, family SES was negatively associated with PAS through its negative association with authoritarian parenting, regardless of the quarantine length. Model comparison analyses between high-risk region versus low/medium-risk region groups indicated that the pandemic risk for living regions did not alter any pathway in the model. Such findings inform the designs of targeted interventions to help families cope with pandemic-related challenges. Promoting parental investment and adaptive patenting style represents an avenue to diminish consequences of family economic hardship for young children's mental health, regardless of macrolevel pandemic risk. Interventions should attend to home quarantine duration, as it contextualizes the links among family SES, parenting, and child well-being.","Zhang, Limin, Cao, Hongjian, Lin, Chaopai, Ye, Pingzhi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Family+Socioeconomic+Status+and+Chinese+Preschoolersâ€™+Anxious+Symptoms+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+The+Roles+of+Parental+Investment,+Parenting+Style,+Home+Quarantine+Length,+and+Regional+Pandemic+Risk","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Early childhood research quarterly;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26474,""
"How does the impact of the COVID-19 state of emergency change? An analysis of preventive behaviors and mental health using panel data in Japan","This study applies the difference-in-difference method on panel data collected from internet surveys to investigate changes in the preventive behaviors and mental health of individuals as influenced by the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration between March and June 2020. The key findings are: (1) The declaration led people to exhibit preventive behaviors but also generated negative emotions;(2) Such behaviors persisted even after deregulation of the state of emergency;(3) Making the declaration early (vs. late) had a larger effect on preventive behavior, with the gap between residentsâ€™ behaviors for areas that made early vs. late declarations persisting after the deregulation;and (4) The effects on mental health diminished during the state of emergency and disappeared after its deregulation.","Yamamura, Eiji, Tsutsui, Yoshiro","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+does+the+impact+of+the+COVID-19+state+of+emergency+change?+An+analysis+of+preventive+behaviors+and+mental+health+using+panel+data+in+Japan","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Journal of the Japanese and international economies; 64:101194-101194, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26475,""
"A literature review of whether communication skills specific to psychiatry are being taught to medical undergraduates around the world","Aims The ability to communicate effectively is an imperative skill for clinicians to master as doctor-patient communication is one of the most essential dynamics in health care. Patients with a mental disorder present a unique challenge for doctors with regards to effective communication due to the nature of their illness. This literature review aimed to determine whether medical undergraduates around the world are taught psychiatric communication skills. Method In January 2021, the following electronic databases were searched for articles relating to medical undergraduates, the concept of psychiatric communication skills and the teaching and support of such skill development: ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SAGE and Web of Science. Combinations of keywords focussed the content of papers and truncation obtained alternative word endings. Generated articles were appraised iteratively for suitability against pre-defined inclusion criteria. The bibliographies of eligible articles were then examined to capture any further relevant studies. Ethical approval was not required. Result 1040 citations of potential relevance were initially identified. Following an iterative screening process, 10 articles (from seven different countries) were eligible for inclusion. 70% of papers used the modality of simulated patients to teach psychiatric communication skills and Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) was used to create â€œvirtual patientsâ€ for undergraduates to engage with. Discussing sensitive and emotive topics, such as suicide attempts or substance misuse, was less commonly taught compared to conditions such as anxiety and depression. Only 10% of papers explicitly taught medical undergraduates empathy or written communication skills and the importance placed on psychiatric teaching differed between countries. Conclusion This literature review showed that some medical undergraduates receive psychiatric communication skills teaching, but the format and content of this varies. Increased consideration of incorporating TEL into psychiatric communications skills teaching is pertinent given undergraduatesâ€™ reduced face-to-face patient contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, but further work is needed to validate such technology. Written communication skills are rarely taught but are imperative given the high volume of written correspondence in clinical practice. Delivering such teaching is feasible and should be incorporated into undergraduate curricula. Medical educators need to consider cultural differences when developing psychiatric communication skills teaching. Cultural influences not only affect undergraduate perceptions of psychiatry and mental illness, but also a patient's understanding and interpretation of their illness experience. Medical undergraduates may come from various cultural backgrounds, so actively discussing these differences opportunistically may augment the ability of medical undergraduates to be empathetic and establish therapeutic rapport with patients with mental illness.","Winfield, Sarah, Hyland, Declan","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+literature+review+of+whether+communication+skills+specific+to+psychiatry+are+being+taught+to+medical+undergraduates+around+the+world","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S301-S302, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26476,""
"COVID and early intervention: the impact of COVID-19 on referrals to an early intervention service","Aims COVID-19 has a demonstratable impact on the population's mental health and is associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders, including patients experiencing psychotic presentations. The aim of this study was to explore whether referral rates within a county-wide Early Intervention (EI) service changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The EI service provides NICE approved treatments and support for patients experiencing a First Episode Psychosis (FEP). Method Data were collected from all referrals to the EI service between Marchâ€“December 2019 and Marchâ€“December 2020. Clinical notes were reviewed to ascertain whether the referred patient was assessed and if they were subsequently accepted on to the team's caseload. Result During the Marchâ€“December 2019 period 147 referrals were made to the EI service, with 66 patients being accepted for treatment by the service (44.9% of referrals). In Marchâ€“December 2020, 127 referrals were made, a 13.6% reduction compared to the same period in 2019, however 70 referrals were accepted (55.1% of referrals). Whilst the overall referrals declined during the COVID-19 period, there were notable increases in both April and August 2020, by 25.0% and 70.0% respectively. Conclusion Although overall referrals to the EI service reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared similarly to the previous year, there was a noteworthy increase in the proportion of patients accepted onto the team's caseload. Potential explanations for this finding include the possibility of an increased incidence of first episode psychosis during this period, or that restrictions in accessing primary care and secondary mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of patients being referred whose symptoms were not representative of First Episode Psychosis (FEP). This study highlights that mental health services, such as EI teams, have experienced a persistent level of need over the past year and that ongoing investment in psychiatric services is warranted to meet this sustained requirement for support and interventions.","Whyte, Adam, Reid, Alastair","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID+and+early+intervention:+the+impact+of+COVID-19+on+referrals+to+an+early+intervention+service","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S112-S112, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26477,""
"Patient experiences of the pandemic;exploring the effect of COVID-19 on patients detained under the Mental Health Act","Aims The current pandemic and the restrictions on liberty that it has necessitated has had a huge impact on society as a whole. We were interested to learn how the constraints of sequential lockdowns and social distancing measures had affected inpatients in a mental health setting, many of whom were already contending with significant restrictions on their freedom. Method We conducted structured interviews with 24 service users across the Low Secure and Locked Rehabilitation Division at St Andrews Healthcare Northampton. We interviewed male and female inpatients with diverse diagnoses including emotionally unstable personality disorder, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia and offending behaviours. All participants were detained under the Mental Health Act throughout the pandemic. Service users were asked the following questions: How has the pandemic affected your mood? How has it affected your relationship with your family? How has it affected your treatment? How has the pandemic affected your leave? How has it affected how you use your free time? Are there any other ways the pandemic has affected you? We performed thematic analysis to identify ways the pandemic has affected service users. Result Four major themes were identified: Mental health Participants reported a decline in mood. Changing relationshipsService users reported that relationships with loved ones in the community had suffered from lack of contact and missing significant life events, however several participants felt that their relationships with peers had strengthened. 3) Delivery of care Responses were split on the increased reliance on technology to replace face-to-face interaction between patients and team members, with some respondents reporting this as 'less intimidating', while others found this â€˜isolatingâ€™. Respondents reported reduced contact with MDT members and delays to recovery and step-down placements due to decreased leave. 4) Routine Respondents reported an increase in free time throughout the pandemic. Some used this to develop hobbies whereas others reported becoming â€˜lazyâ€™ and expressed disappointment with the lack of exercise provision. Conclusion The pandemic has had significant emotional and psychological effects on society as a whole, but perhaps no group has been more affected than detained patients who have had their lives restricted to a massive degree. This group has been largely marginalised by government guidelines which often fail to consider individuals living in large group settings. By learning from the experiences of these service users we can adapt our practices to alleviate these issues in any future lockdowns and ensure our practices are the least restrictive possible.","Watson, Emily, Rowles, Samuel","https://www.google.com/search?q=Patient+experiences+of+the+pandemic;exploring+the+effect+of+COVID-19+on+patients+detained+under+the+Mental+Health+Act","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S299-S300, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26478,""
"Mental health clothing bank - adDressing the issue","Aims We often have patients who are admitted to the ward wearing only the clothes they came in. These patients have no way of going to get more clothes due to being detained, poverty/ homelessness or covid restrictions. Many do not have friends or family who can bring them clothes. As such they might wear one set of clothes for a number of weeks which is bad for their physical and mental health. We are creating a clothes bank to provide a change of clothes for these patients, and help their recovery back into the community. Many have clothes that are inappropriate for the current weather, or do not have a set of smart enough clothes for a job interview. We feel that this simple intervention will have a big community impact. Method We have obtained support from a number of charities and companies to supply donations. The project will be led by a team of staff and patients. Result We will review the usage of this scheme in 6 months time Conclusion We hope this intervention will tackle the issue of clothing on mental health wards. In the future we wish to expand this to outpatient mental health service users. We would then like to expand this project countrywide as are unaware of any other areas providing something similar.","Ward, Louisa","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+clothing+bank+-+adDressing+the+issue","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S226-S226, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26479,""

To review the literature, 32 articles were examined in the following databases: Scopus, EBSCO and Scielo;in English and Spanish, between 2020-2021. The search terms were: ""teachers AND Covid-19"", ""impact of Covid-19 on teachers"", ""mental health AND teachers"", ""stress AND COVID-19"", ""family AND COVID-19"". In addition, for the analysis of the results, 14 articles were considered and organized in a data matrix considering the aspects: work life, socio-family and mental health of teachers;framed in the COVID-19 context. As a result, in one study, 36.1% of teachers indicated that they were moderately satisfied with their work because they were not prepared to take on virtual education. Likewise, other authors found that levels of stress and distress were increasing, reaching very serious levels. Consequently, studies carried out on the impact of COVID-19 on teachers' work show that it has significantly affected their daily educational work, but that teachers have found coping strategies to deal with this new social and pedagogical dynamic.","Ulloa, Cristina Asuncion Lopez, Vergaray, Juan MÃ©ndez, Flores, Edward","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+the+Teaching+Work:+From+Face-to-Face+to+Virtual","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education; 12(6):2125-2131, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26481,""
"Experiences of psychiatrists assessing under 18s on an â€œall ageâ€ rota An evaluation of the current service","Aims Gloucestershire Health Care Trust operates an â€œall ageâ€ out of hours on-call rota, staffed by Registrars and Consultants who cross-cover all psychiatric sub-specialities. Our aim was to understand the challenges faced by psychiatrists of different professional backgrounds when assessing under 18 year olds in a health-based Place of Safety (POS). Method We circulated a survey to all psychiatrists on the on-call rota, to gather quantitative and qualitative information on the challenges posed by assessments of under-18s in a POS and assess whether an under-18 specific policy was needed. Result Out of the 50 psychiatrists invited, 27 completed this survey (during February 2021). 33.3% of respondents reported that they had completed a POS assessment of an under 18-year-old when a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist/Registrar was not available to join. 33.3% of respondents had been asked to complete such an assessment as the sole psychiatrist joining the AMHP, with 24% of those respondents reporting feeling uncomfortable doing these assessments without a second doctor present, and an additional 24% feeling comfortable only sometimes. 48.1% of the doctors surveyed did not invite parents or carers to take part in the assessment, despite this being considered best practice, citing reasons such as: being unaware that this was a possibility, assessments conducted at unsociable hours, safeguarding concerns involving the parents, and social distancing in the context of COVID-19. 41% of respondents had assessed vulnerable young people (children looked after or with a diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition) in the POS and reported that these assessments posed significant challenges to safe discharge planning and identifying appropriate placements. 81.5% felt that a tailored policy for young people was needed. Qualitative findings suggest psychiatrists think such a policy should include clear procedures (flowcharts), potential outcome scenarios/options for safe discharge, referral criteria for CAMHS, contact details for key staff members, a handover protocol. Respondents felt a shared policy with all stakeholders (AMHP service, Mental Health Services, police) was required. Conclusion Our survey highlights the challenges for non-CAMHS specialists assessing under 18s in a health-based POS and the need for an under-18 policy to support safe practice. Major themes will be further explored in a focus group to guide policy development.","Turtoi, Nicoleta Clarisa, Ansell, Martin, Govender, Trinisha, Bould, Helen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Experiences+of+psychiatrists+assessing+under+18s+on+an+â€œall+ageâ€+rota.+An+evaluation+of+the+current+service","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S315-S315, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26482,""
"Improving patient access to medication information: a quality improvement project on patient-centred prescribing","Aims Ward rounds are sometimes the only opportunity for patients to discuss medication. Patient and professional feedback on an acute male inpatient ward in South London highlighted a demand for more medication information outside the formal ward round setting. We aimed to have 100% of patients meet our criteria for â€œPatient-Centred Prescribingâ€ on the ward by March 2021. To fulfil criteria, all patients are offered: (1) ward round discussion, (2) written patient information leaflets (PILs), (3) informal discussion groups, all regarding medication. The principles of this quality improvement project (QIP) were drawn from definitions of patient-centred care and standards of good practice;patients should have access to a variety of information formats, relevant to the individual, and the knowledge gained empowers patients. Patient experience data revealed that 30% of clients answered passively to the question, â€œDo you feel involved in your care?â€ We hypothesized that medication discussion groups positively impact patientsâ€™ wellbeing, by providing a safe space that facilitates conversation surrounding medication issues. Method We conducted weekly audits on patients whose admission duration was &gt;7 days, and recorded fulfilment of the above criteria. At week 1, we introduced a program of weekly medication discussion groups led by members of the wider multi-disciplinary team covering a broad topic range. At week 6, we developed a rolling rota of the discussion groups and posters were displayed in advance. At week 14, all patients were offered PILs through a 1:1 interaction and this continued as routine practice. Medication discussion group feedback was obtained via questionnaires and â€œThe Blob Treeâ€, a psycho-emotional assessment tool commonly used in healthcare settings. Result In 19 weeks, the median percentage of patients who fulfilled our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing was 92.86%. After 11 medication discussion groups, 79.3% of questionnaire responders wanted further sessions. 88% of â€œThe Blob Treeâ€ responses collected inferred a positive emotional response after the group discussions and half of those noticed an improvement in their emotional state. Conclusion This QIP was overall a success;it fulfilled a requirement to meet good standards in information sharing and became embedded in the fabric of the ward, continuing to run as part of the activities program. It demonstrated the impact of education on patientsâ€™ mental wellbeing through empowerment and peer support. As a by-product it established multidisciplinary connections and improved therapeutic relationships. Challenges included patient engagement secondary to acute mental illness or negative symptoms and maintaining project momentum following a COVID-19 outbreak.","Todd, Anna, Blunstone, Rosy","https://www.google.com/search?q=Improving+patient+access+to+medication+information:+a+quality+improvement+project+on+patient-centred+prescribing","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S225-S225, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26483,""
"Psychiatric liaison referrals: a thematic analysis during peak COVID-19","Aims With the advent of the COVID-19 Pandemic the NHS long term Plan commitments of January 2019 to improve crisis care nationwide became all the more pressing. The aim of this study was to thematically investigate what mental health crisis presentations might be diverted from the Emergency department to external crisis hubs in order to reduce the COVID-19 contamination risks. Method All referrals made to the Homerton University Hospital (HUH) mental health liaison service were looked at between 1/3/20-11/6/20 (n = 846), coinciding with the first peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Referral data was anonymised and sorted independently into naturally emerging thematic classes by two junior liaison doctors. Cases that did not clearly fit any of the 14 themes generated were further looked into to determine outcome of referral and discussed to try and match to an appropriate class. Result 14 frequent themes for mental health crisis referrals were identified. The distribution of these ranged from most common (suicidality) to neurocognitive presentation and identified shifts in themes over the course of the pandemic peak such as increases of low mood, anxiety and intoxication requiring medical attention over the three month period. Conclusion Although themes for presentations may be identified in acute referrals to mental health liaison services it is problematic determining how these may be parsed safely to crisis hubs without risking overlooking cases that may require medical attention. The most common theme that was identified and remained throughout the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic was acute suicidal presentation.

"An analytical cross-sectional study to describe and compare the mental health status of doctors and medical undergraduates in selected institutions in Colombo, Sri Lanka during COVID-19 pandemic","Aims The aim of this study was to describe and compare the mental health status of doctors and medical undergraduates in selected institutions during COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among doctors working in major tertiary care hospitals two of which, risk is unpredictable and high, the other where all patients are positive for COVID-19 and among medical undergraduates. The doctors were selected using disproportionate stratified sampling and medical undergraduates using stratified cluster sampling. Data were gathered using a Google form containing socio-demographic details, perception on the pandemic and the General Health Questionnaire-12(GHQ-12). Result There were 468 participants in the study and among them 243(51.9%) were doctors. Mean age of the doctorsâ€™ is 34.54(SD = 7.43) years and more than half (50.06%) were in post graduate training. Majority were worried about their health (65%) and their loved one's health (90.1%). Among doctors 220(90.5%) felt that they have moderate or higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 and 15.6% would not have worked due to the risk. According to GHQ-12, 182(74%) doctors were psychologically distressed (mean GHQ = 12.64, SD = 4.54) and it was significantly associated with age less than 35 years (p = 0.039) and worry about interruption of their daily routines(p = 0.010). The mean age of 225 medical undergraduates was 25.20 (SD = 1.34) years and 176(78.2%) of the participants were psychologically distressed (mean GHQ = 14.32, SD = 6.67). Majority (59.11%) believed that they are at high risk of getting COVID-19. Their distress was significantly associated with the worry about the impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on their daily routines (p = 0.000). Binomial logistic regression confirmed that doctors were distressed due to impact on their income whereas both doctors and medical undergraduates were distressed due to impact on daily routines. Conclusion Nearly three quarter of both doctors and medical undergraduates were psychologically distressed during COVID-19 pandemic. The worry was due to contracting illness, financial issues and the COVID-19 regulations.","Suraweera, Chathurie, Perera, Iresha, Rupasinghe, Priyanka, Galhenage, Janith","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+analytical+cross-sectional+study+to+describe+and+compare+the+mental+health+status+of+doctors+and+medical+undergraduates+in+selected+institutions+in+Colombo,+Sri+Lanka+during+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S293-S293, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26485,""
"Audit of physical health monitoring in a forensic psychiatric community caseload","Aims Adherence to Cumbria Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation (CNTW) Trust physical health monitoring guidelines for a caseload of community forensic psychiatry patients residing at Westbridge supported accommodation was audited to identify areas for improvement in practice. It was also our aim to highlight the delay in obtaining non-urgent investigations due to the need to minimize COVID infection transmission risks. Method Data were collected from mental health and acute trust electronic records (Rio and ICE) of all patients taking antipsychotic medications currently care coordinated by the Westbridge Forensic Community Mental Health Team (FCMHT) between January 2020 and January 2021 (8 patients). Analysis of compliance with standards set by Trust guidelines was made. Result In the chosen audit period, compliance with physical health monitoring standards was below target of 100% (80% compliance for bloods, 50% for ECG). Reasons for non-compliance were unexpected restrictions in service availability (e.g. temporary closure of walk-in ECG clinic) and one omission of sending a prolactin levels request. Conclusion The need for practice adaptation and advance planning by team in anticipation of potential delays was identified. Request for routine bloods and ECGs will now be made two months before the annual due dates to compensate for delays in the new process with plan to continue re-audit yearly.","Sud, Neeti, Lacey, Michael","https://www.google.com/search?q=Audit+of+physical+health+monitoring+in+a+forensic+psychiatric+community+caseload","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S107-S107, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26486,""
"COVID-19 confinement impact on weight gain and physical activity in the older adult population: data from the LOST in Lombardia study","Background & Aims COVID-19 containment measures significantly impacted lifestyle of the general population, including physical activity. Although the older adults are particularly susceptible to the potential consequences of sedentary lifestyle and inactivity, few studies investigated pandemic effects in this segment of the population. We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 pandemic effects on weight gain and physical activity in the Italian older adults, and assess the impact of possible changes in physical activity on mental health wellbeing. Methods In November 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted on a representative sample of 4,400 older adults (aged 65 or more) from the Lombardy region, Northern Italy. Changes in body mass index (BMI) and physical activity were assessed, compared to the previous year. Using unconditional multiple logistic models, we estimated the odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of a decrease in physical activity during COVID-19 pandemic and we evaluated if decreased physical activity was a determinant of a worsening in psychological wellbeing. Results Neither weight gain nor increase in obesity prevalence occurred during the pandemic. Mean time spent in physical activity significantly decreased, with 43.8% of participants reporting a decrease of one hour/week or more during COVID-19 pandemic. A decreased physical activity was determinant of a worsening of selected mental health outcomes, such as: sleep quality (OR=2.45;95% CI: 1.91-3.15) and quantity (OR=1.54;95% CI: 1.18-2.02), anxiety (OR=1.31;95% CI: 1.14-1.52) and depressive symptoms (OR=1.61;95% CI: 1.38-1.88). Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, while no major changes in BMI were observed, physical activity significantly declined in the older adults. In this population, the lack of physical activity might have contributed to the observed worsening in mental health. During emergency periods, encouraging physical activity might be effective also to preserve psychological wellbeing.","Stival, Chiara, Lugo, Alessandra, Bosetti, Cristina, Amerio, Andrea, Serafini, Gianluca, Cavalieri dâ€™Oro, Luca, Odone, Anna, Stuckler, David, Iacoviello, Licia, Bonaccio, Marialaura, van den Brandt, Piet, Zucchi, Alberto, Gallus, Silvano","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+confinement+impact+on+weight+gain+and+physical+activity+in+the+older+adult+population:+data+from+the+LOST+in+Lombardia+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Clinical nutrition ESPEN;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26487,""
"COVID-19 economic impact payments and opioid overdose deaths","Background Given the global economic recessions mediated by the COVID-19 pandemic and that many countries have implemented direct income support programs, we investigated the timing of the COVID-19 economic impact payments and opioid overdose deaths. Methods A longitudinal, observational study design that included data from the Ohio Department of Health was utilized. Statistical change point analyses were conducted to identify significant changes in weekly number of opioid overdose deaths from January 1 of 2018 to August 1 of 2020. Additional analyses including difference-in-difference, time series tests, interrupted time series regression analysis and Granger causality test were performed. Results A single change point was identified and occurred at week 16, 2020. For 2020, the median opioid overdose deaths numbers for weeks 1-16 and weeks 17-32 were 68.5 and 101, respectively. The opioid overdose deaths numbers from weeks 17-32 of 2020 were significantly higher than those in weeks 1-16 of 2020 and those in 2018 and 2019 (before and after week 16). The interrupted time series regression analysis indicated more than 203 deaths weekly for weeks 17-32 of 2020 compared to all other weeks. The result of the Granger causality test found that the identified change point (week 16 of 2020) directly influenced the increase in opioid overdose deaths in weeks 17-32 of 2020. Conclusion The identified change point may refer to the timing of many factors, not only the economic payments and further research is warranted to investigate the potential relationship between the COVID-19 economic impact payments and overdose deaths.","Sprague, Jon E.; Yeh, Arthur B.; Lan, Qizhen, Vieson, Jamie, McCorkle, Maggie","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+economic+impact+payments+and+opioid+overdose+deaths","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: The International journal on drug policy;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26488,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on obsessive compulsive disorder: a single case study","Objective A growing body of research evidence shows that individuals with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic including deterioration of OCD symptoms plus relapse from previously well-controlled OCD. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in a single case study of a patient with OCD consisting of contamination concerns. In addition, the effectiveness of providing Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) virtually is evaluated with regards to the treatment outcome in COVID-19 related OCD. Case report This study describes a 41-year-old, single, employed female with OCD consisting of concerns of contamination and infecting others thereby causing harm. The total duration of the disorder is 32 years with the most recent presentation being of three years duration. Relapse during the pandemic resulted in OCD symptoms being solely concerned with COVID-related contamination. The questionnaires routinely completed at the time of assessment and treatment were the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI);Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS);Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Clinical data were collated and analysed prior to and during the pandemic. Treatment consisted of ERP and was adapted for provision via a virtual platform. ERP involved exposure to a graded hierarchy of COVID-specific anxiety-provoking situations modified to take government guidelines into consideration. Discussion Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the patient's response to treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) including ERP indicated a 79% improvement in OCD symptoms on self -rated measures. The impact of the pandemic led to a significant 65% deterioration in OCD symptoms, regarding COVID-19 contamination concerns. Intervention with ERP resulted in 73% improvement over a three-month period. Measures of depression symptoms indicated an 80% improvement pre-COVID, with a 78% deterioration at relapse. Following treatment, the patient also showed a 65% improvement in depression symptoms. Improvements have been maintained at one month follow-up. Conclusion The case study supports literature indicating the exacerbation of OCD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with contamination fears and washing compulsions. The promising results support the use of ERP as an effective treatment for COVID-related OCD symptoms. It also validates the provision of CBT interventions virtually to ensure accessibility of treatment to OCD sufferers.","Sibanda-Mbanga, Josephine, Govender, Anusha","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+obsessive+compulsive+disorder:+a+single+case+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S120-S121, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26489,""
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress disorders among medical students in Alexandria Faculty of Medicine during COVID-19 pandemic","Aims We aimed to assess the impact of the current pandemic on the mental well-being of undergraduate medical students of Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Egypt. Method We designed a structured anonymous online questionnaire and encourage students to fill it in on social platforms. The questionnaire is composed of seven parts, each one includes multiple choice questions aimed to measure the impact of the pandemic on different aspect of daily activities namely: academic performance, social and family relationship, eating and smoking habits, sleep pattern, physical activity and the Depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). The last part was an open question where participants can state their comments about the experiences during the quarantine and how they affected their mental health. Result A total of 1181 students from the six academic grades responded. Females and students in the third academic year showed the highest prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. Overall, most respondents reported that the current pandemic had negative impacts on their academic performance (71%) and social relationship (67.5 %). The majority of the students stated that they became less physically active (74.6%) and 52.2% experienced a weight gain. Despite that 60% of the studied population rated their sleeping quality as â€˜â€™very goodâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€™fairly goodâ€™â€™, 45.3% and 39.6% suffered from increased sleeping hours and disturbed sleep respectively. Based on studentsâ€™ responses of the DASS-21, over half of the participants (62.2%) were experiencing moderate to extremely severe stress and over 33% were consistent with symptoms of extremely severe anxiety. In respect of depression, nearly half of the sample (46.4%) can be described as having extremely severe depression according to the cut-off points of the DASS-21. Conclusion The current pandemic has increased the challenges and burdens on undergraduate medical students. These impacts can be more profound in developing countries such as Egypt. The levels of psychiatric symptoms are alarming compared to previous local and international studies. These unprecedented consequences should be addressed promptly through studentsâ€™ counselling and psychiatric assistance. To date, this is the largest psychiatric and survey-based study conducted on Alexandria Faculty of Medicine.

"Acute mania with psychotic symptom in post COVID-19 patient","Aims COVID-19 is an on-going pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including mania. We present a case of a middle aged man presenting with acute mania with psychotic symptoms 20 days post COVID infection in the absence of prior psychiatric illness. This report highlights the need for rigorous neuropsychiatric assessment in patient with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method A 52-year-old man of West African origin with past history of hypertension and no previous history of mental health illness presented with acute manic symptoms on background of two weeks of high fever, diarrhoea, mild headache, dry cough and anosmia. He was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID PCR test. He was under self-isolation along with his family members who exhibited mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, none of them required hospital admission. He was initially fearful to seek medical attention but was brought in by family after exhibiting behaviour changes, obsession with toilet cleaning, reckless spending and getting aggressive approximately two weeks after the onset of acute upper respiratory symptoms. He presented elated in mood with pressure of speech and grandiose ideas. Investigations like neuroimaging and bloods were unremarkable. Initial psychiatric assessment found symptoms consistent with acute mania and he was detained under the Mental Health Act. During admission, he was sexually disinhibited and agitated on the ward requiring IM antipsychotics. He was treated with high dose of Olanzapine and Sodium valproate and his symptoms subsided within two weeks. Result This case emphasises the manifestation of neuropsychiatric illness post COVID-19 without a background of psychiatric illness, hypoxemia and cerebral infarction. Based on the CORONERVE Programme and latest retrospective Lancet cohort studies, the period between 14 and 90 days after diagnosis, 5.8% COVID-19 survivors had their first recorded diagnosis of psychiatric illness. It is also important to consider other organic disease given the simultaneous diagnosis of COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to confirm here due to the lack of a validated CSF-PCR assay, previous reports have implicated SARS-CoV-2 in the development of viral encephalitis, and this remains an important differential. Conclusion Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of patients with COVID-19 developing neuropsychiatric complications post SARS-CoV-2 infection, mandating the need for vigilant initial neuropsychiatric assessment and possibly follow-up care in 3 months.","Shanmugam, Sridevi, Kumar, Praveen, Carr, Blaga","https://www.google.com/search?q=Acute+mania+with+psychotic+symptom+in+post+COVID-19+patient","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S50-S51, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26491,""
"Addiction service changes due to COVID-19","Aims Addictions services had to respond rapidly to reduce COVID-19 transmission to protect patients and staff. Patients with opioid dependence are particularly vulnerable, with high risks. Our community addiction service changed practice in line with COVID-19 guidelines. For patients with opioid dependence;face-to-face contacts were initially reduce and mainly for new starts, restarts and non-attenders. Prescribing changes were completed on an individually risk assessed basis to reduce attendance at the chemist, specifically to reduce transmission, keep patients in treatment and to ensure chemists could continue to function. We document some of the service changes during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method Service evaluation had approval from Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust. Data retrieved on one Hub of a community addictions service in North England, UK. Patients prescribed opioid substitution treatment for opioid dependence were assessed, with data retrieval through electronic healthcare records. Data were analysed by Microsoft Excel anonymously. Result In lockdown (March 2020 to June 2020), we identified 112 patients with opioid dependence prescribed opioid substitution (OST) with methadone or buprenorphine at the Hub. All white British, mean 42 years, most male (75%) and prescribed methadone (78%). Ten were new starts and 8 restarts to OST. Attendance rates did not change: 91% before and 92% during lockdown. Appointment format changed from predominantly face-to-face (92%) to telephone (99%). Most patients (91%;n = 88) were offered take-home naloxone and overdose prevention training of which 14 refused. Supervision days at the chemist for OST reduced significantly from 75% collecting daily at the chemist, reducing to 20% during lockdown. Five patients were shielding and 7 had covid-related symptoms. There was one death during lockdown which was not attributed to covid or overdose. Conclusion The addictions service continued to be open and work proactively throughout lockdown, seeing new patients and continuing treatment interventions safely. Major changes were made in line with COVID-19 guidelines, to respond to the threat of transmission. Our service was flexible and able to adapt quickly to remote working. We maintained excellent attendance rates despite changes to the format of consultations. There were no related incidents e.g. overdoses linked to prescribed medications, despite a reduction in supervision, and therefore patients having extra medications. This important finding may be related to the individual risk assessments that we conducted before making changing to prescribing. This was supported by most patients were receiving naloxone to prevent overdoses. Some of the changes, such as telephone consultations, may be beneficial to continue post COVID-19.","Shahbaz, Shumaila, Hashmani, Zeeshan, Mayet, Soraya","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addiction+service+changes+due+to+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S349-S349, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26492,""
"COVID-19 antibody seroprevalence in residential psychiatric inpatients","Aims While other mental health care outpatient facilities were moved to COVID-centers in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Kashmir remained the only functional outpatient facility in the region. It is the only mental health care hospital in the country with a residential facility for psychiatric inpatients catering to the whole population of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The Mental Health Care Act 2017 that neccesitated â€œhalfway homesâ€ is yet to be implemented in the state leaving it's inpatients entirely under the institution's care. This study is to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-COVID-19 virus in the 34 residential inpatients in separate male (23 patients) and female (11 patients) wards. This was done as an audit to strategies and measures taken by the institute in protecting it's inpatients. Method 3 to 5 ml of peripheral venous blood samples were collected and plasma extracted and analysed using the CE-IVD Roche Cobas Elecsys AntiSARS-CoV-2, Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for the qualitative detection of total Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA;Pan Ig) generated against SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Result Out of the 34 inpatients, 2 male inpatients tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (seroprevalence of 5.88%). In comparison, based on a report conducted by the government's Department of Community Medicine and Biochemistry on the 28th of October 2020, out of 2,361 participants in the community, 959 tested positive (seroprevalence of 40.6%). One of the inpatients that tested positive was re-admitted after testing negative via RT-PCR. The second patient was admitted after being found homeless. He was tested negative on day 1 via RAT and on day 5 via RT-PCR. We believe both of them aquired the infection in the community. Conclusion This audit shows that the strategies implemented by the institute were effective in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19. Practical implementations of what works and improvisations are the proven methods of decreasing the mortality and morbidity in vulnerable populations while continuously providing vital mental health services.","Shah, Sheena, Hussain, Arshad, Qadri, Sabreena, Roub, Fazle, Rauf, Insha, Kumar, Praveen","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+antibody+seroprevalence+in+residential+psychiatric+inpatients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S102-S102, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26493,""
"Attitudes surrounding the disclosure of mental illness","Aims To survey the effect of COVID-19 on mental health of both medical professionals and the general population, as well as attitudes surrounding the disclosure of mental illness. Method An online survey comprised of two questionnaires, one for medical professionals and one for the general population, were conducted via social media. Both questionnaires asked respondents of the effect of COVID-19 on their mental health, and the former asked respondents about the effect of COVID-19 on their patient group's mental health. The questionnaires went on to ask respondents about their attitudes to mental health disclosure in various scenarios, to varying groups of people. The general population group was also asked how they would react if someone else disclosed their mental illness to them. Result The questionnaire for the medical professionals gained 62 respondents and the one for the general population had 122 respondents, with responses from multiple nations. Overall, COVID-19 has affected everyone's mental health to a degree, and all groups had reservations about disclosing their mental health issues to others. The medical professionals were especially reluctant to disclose mental illness to their patients, but were more comfortable when it came to disclosing mental illness to colleagues. The general population, however, was much more reluctant to disclose mental health issues to their colleagues. The general population were, on the whole, willing to listen to and help anyone who came to them with mental health concerns. Both groups surveyed showed reluctance toward disclosure to the wider community. Conclusion COVID-19 appears to significantly affect not only physical health, but mental health as well. There is at least some degree of stigma surrounding the disclosure of mental health issues. While most would be happy to help anyone who came to them with their mental health problems, there seems to be an attitude shift when people must contend with mental health issues of their own.","Sengupta, Brishti, Dasgupta, Pritha","https://www.google.com/search?q=Attitudes+surrounding+the+disclosure+of+mental+illness","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S288-S289, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26494,""
"CAMHS Emergency Assessment Service (EAS): development & implementation during the COVID-19 crisis","Aims To provide emergency psychiatric assessment throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To maintain patient and staff safety by minimising exposure to infection risk by reducing A&E contact. To alleviate pressures on the A&E department by enabling CAMHS patients be seen in an alternative setting. To provide a more appropriate environment for the assessment of young people in acute distress. Method Service live 8th April 2020 to 8th June 2020. Exclusion criteria: 1) confirmed/suspected overdose;2) self-harm with injuries requiring medical attention;3) acute psychotic episode;4) drug/alcohol intoxication;5) high risk of absconding (ASD/LD/LAC), 6) severe agitation/aggression;7) eating disorders requiring medical intervention;8) section 136 of the MHA;9) break down of a social care placement;10)medically unexplained symptoms. Data reviewed of all young people who were referred to A&E during Marchâ€“April 2020. Each case was assessed as to whether they were then seen within the EAS Service. These cases were reviewed demographically looking at ethnicity, gender, while also reviewing the reason for referral. Result A total of 90 cases referred to Urgent Care Team Nineteen (21%) met criteria for assessment at EAS 80% of presentations between 12am and 9am. Commonest reasons for referral : low mood with suicidal ideation (42%), anxiety (26%) 50% service users not previously known to CAMHS Majority of service users were female Mean age 15 years All but one of the young people assessed at the EAS, were discharged home with community follow-up Conclusion Average total no. monthly referrals to CAMHS Urgent Care Team (UCT) fell from approx. 90 to 45. Only a small proportion of referrals (21%) could be safely seen by the EAS, suggesting that the majority of young people required a joint assessment by A&E and CAMHS Urgent Care Team. When need arises, very rapid reconfiguration and implementation of CAMHS emergency services is achievable. EAS diverted a small number of young people from exposure to COVID-19 in A & E. The service was set up speedily without evaluation of parent/carer/young people views or evaluation of cost-effectiveness. If similar services are to be set up permanently, the balance between safety and the risk of division between mental & physical health services and potential to increase stigmatisation of mental illness should be considered. Adaptation to future outbreaks should be informed by this initiative.","Saour, Tania, Tolmac, Jovanka, Girelas, Braulio, Turton, William, Branney, Lauren","https://www.google.com/search?q=CAMHS+Emergency+Assessment+Service+(EAS):+development+&+implementation+during+the+COVID-19+crisis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S55-S55, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26495,""
"The impact of one-year COVID-19 containment measures in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: a longitudinal survey-based study","Background We assessed levels of depression, anxiety, stress, anhedonia, somatization, psychological distress, sleep, and life quality in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients after one year of containment measures started in Italy to stem the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We consecutively enrolled 51 MTLE patients, administering an online survey that compared the year before and after the COVID-19 propagation. We analyzed clinical data (e.g., seizures frequency, life quality) and neuropsychological assessment through Somatic Symptom Scaleâ€“8 (SSS-8), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The BDI-2 and STAI-Y scores were compared to those acquired in the same patients before the COVID-19 outbreak. Results Comparing our MTLE population before and after COVID-19 outbreak, we found a significant worsening in life quality (p=0.03), SSS-8 (p=0.001), BDI-2 (p=0.032), and STAI-Y scores (p &lt;0.001). After one year of pandemic, 88.2% of patients obtained pathological scores at PSQI, 19.6% at SHAPS, 29.4% at IES-R. Reduction of life quality correlated with anxiety, depression, stress, and somatization. Higher levels of anhedonia correlated with stress, depression, and anxiety. Somatization correlated with depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Distress levels correlated with anxiety, somatization, and depression. Conclusions We demonstrated a significant worsening of depression, anxiety, life quality, and somatization in MTLE patients after one year of COVID-19 beginning. Concomitantly, results suggest that the pandemic had a negative impact on sleep quality, psychological distress, and anhedonia, but not on epilepsy itself.","Sammarra, Ilaria, Martino, Iolanda, Caligiuri, Maria Eugenia, Giugno, Alessia, Fortunato, Francesco, Labate, Angelo, Gambardella, Antonio","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+one-year+COVID-19+containment+measures+in+patients+with+mesial+temporal+lobe+epilepsy:+a+longitudinal+survey-based+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Epilepsy & behavior : E&B;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26496,""
"Remotely connected: patient and clinician video care experiences in secondary mental health services during COVID-19, including future preferences","Aims Video-delivered care is a rapidly emerging area with potential to transform assessment and treatment strategies. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated these changes. Limited evidence exists for experiences of video care in secondary mental health services. We aimed to assess the acceptability of video care in mental health clinical practice during COVID-19. Method Structured questionnaires were developed with the help of patients and clinicians. The patient experience questionnaire was built into video sessions and completed online, using the Attend Anywhere (AA) platform from July 2020 to March 2021. A Trust-wide clinician views and experiences survey was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS (version 27.0). Result Of 1,296 patients who completed the online feedback, the majority provided positive feedback for all aspects of video care. Most patients felt their needs were met (90%) and were supported (93%) during the video call. Positive experiences were informed by cliniciansâ€™ communication skills. For future appointments, just over half (51.7%) of patients preferred using video calls, followed by face-to-face (33%). Future video preference was informed by reasons reducing social anxiety and practical aspects such as child/carer needs, physical disability and travel. Of 252 clinicians completing the survey, 161 (64.7%) had used video for remote care delivery. Clinicians also provided positive feedback, with Microsoft-teams as the preferred platform. Most clinicians felt the therapeutic relationship (76.4%) and privacy (78.7%) were maintained using video. While 73% felt there were no safeguarding issues that impacted adversely, 30% felt that care quality was affected, and (69.9%) reported limited visual cues for video calls. Most clinicians (73%) felt confident about clinical decision-making remotely, though there were areas where clinicians felt less confident, such as assessing patientsâ€™ appearance and behaviour. Additionally, compared with face-to-face, video consultations seemed to be effective for social anxiety, but less so for Autism spectrum disorders, and with no perceived difference for depression or self harm. For future, more clinicians preferred face-to-face (40.1%) than video care (36.1%). Conclusion Mental health care delivered remotely via video is experienced positively by patients and clinicians alike. However, clinicians felt that quality of care is impacted, and additional remote clinical skills training may be beneficial. Going forward, there is acceptability for the use of video care in routine mental health practice for certain mental health presentations.","Samad, Lamiya, Teague, Bonnie, Moreira, Karen, Bagge, Sophie, Elzubeir, Khalifa, Wilson, Jonathan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Remotely+connected:+patient+and+clinician+video+care+experiences+in+secondary+mental+health+services+during+COVID-19,+including+future+preferences","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S48-S49, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26497,""
"Children experiencing sadness: Coping strategies and attachment relationships","This study aimed to explore the events which are sources of sadness for children, and their coping strategies for overcoming their sadness according to their attachment security. We expected that distinct clusters would emerge, with securely attached children more likely showing constructive and successful coping strategies than insecurely attached children. Middle-class children (N = 191) aged 7â€“11Â years old from four private elementary schools were asked to talk about a sad event they experienced using open-ended questions from the Sadness Interview. The answers were coded into different categories of sad events and associated coping strategies. Finally, children were assessed on their security attachment using the Security Scale. Cluster analyses identified a four-cluster solution. Children in the Clusters 1 and 2 were characterized by a perceived successful constructive coping strategy while describing minor events (in the first Cluster), and very painful events (in the second). Furthermore, in the third Cluster children overcame sad events using a perceived successful disengagement coping strategy, whereas children in the fourth Cluster are characterized by perceived unresolved sadness. ANCOVA testing showed that children in the first cluster had significantly higher attachment security compared to Clusters 3 and 4, which did not significantly differ from each other. The study of sadness in children may be particularly informative for clinicians and educators for understanding and supporting childrenâ€™s strategies of sadness management while considering the influence of their attachment relationships on their ability to cope with sadness.","Saija, Edoardo, Ioverno, Salvatore, Baiocco, Roberto, Pallini, Susanna","https://www.google.com/search?q=Children+experiencing+sadness:+Coping+strategies+and+attachment+relationships","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Current psychology (New Brunswick, N.J.);: 1-10, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26498,""
"Lockdown and visual hallucinations in older people: a community perspective","Objective After COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic, different countries have enforced lockdowns, and shielding to mitigate the spread of the virus as preventing loss of lives was the priority. Our aim is to look for possible explanations for increased rates of visual hallucinations presented to Community Mental Health Teams for Older People during the period of lockdown. Case report A review of clinical cases presenting with new onset visual hallucinations to the Community Mental Health Teams for Older People during the lockdown period in 2020 was summarised in two case scenarios. One scenario represents cases with known background of dementia, while the other scenario represents new referrals during the lockdown period with no known psychiatric background. In those cases, the visual hallucinations started during lockdown with no clear cause, did not respond to psychotropic medications, physical health investigations were all normal and hallucinations improved markedly with the end of the lockdown and social isolation. Discussion From clinical practice point of view, during the period of lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic, visual hallucinations has been one of the commonest presentations reported to the Community Mental Health Teams for Older People. Families were calling frequently reporting that their loved ones were â€œseeing thingsâ€. Possible underlying causes include: social isolation, sensory and perceptual deprivation, visual impairment and Charles Bonnet syndrome, lack of cognitive stimulation activities with progress of dementia, superimposed delirium, in addition to depression secondary to loneliness, reduction in community support, increased alcohol consumption and negative effects of repeated media consumption. Conclusion There has been a marked increase in reporting visual hallucinations in the shielding older people population in the community during the period of lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic. This shielded population was not exposed to COVID-19, so it didn't give an explanation to this new phenomenon. Though there are multiple possible causative factors, the effect of the lockdown itself with its resultant social isolation and sensory deprivation remains to be the most significant. Shielding the older people population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic came as an essential measure as the physical safety and preventing loss of lives was the priority;however the lockdown had significant negative effects on the mental health of the shielding population. It remains unclear if those negative effects are going to be reversible in the future, resulting in poor quality of life.","Roufael, Rim","https://www.google.com/search?q=Lockdown+and+visual+hallucinations+in+older+people:+a+community+perspective","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S119-S120, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26499,""
"Nile Ward PICU violence reduction quality improvement project","Aims To reduce incidents of inpatient violence and aggression at Nile Ward Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), St Charles Hospital by at least 30% between December 2019 and December 2020. Reducing inpatient violence is a major quality improvement (QI) priority for CNWL NHS Foundation Trust. Method As a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, Nile Ward looks after male patients suffering from severe mental illness (SMI). This usually includes patients presenting with high levels of violent and aggressive behaviour. Prior to this QI project, there were high levels of patient assaults towards staff and other patients. This required a lot of medication use, including rapid tranquilisation, restraint and the use of seclusion. This QI project was started to allow the Nile MDT to explore ways to reduce serious incidents on the ward in the least restrictive manner. We implemented a number of change ideas within this project. Our change ideas included: 1. A new risk management tool : â€˜Ragging', a daily risk assessment tool, was created to assess patientsâ€™ risk of violence and aggression to allow signposting of appropriate interventions to safely manage risk. 2. A brand new Staff Photo board : New photos of all permanent and bank staff displayed in the ward with no hierarchy of positions. 3. A new Patient Feedback board : Patient experience, comments and feedback displayed in common areas of the ward which are regularly updated. 4. Mutual Expectations between Staff and Patients: A set of expectations created in co-production with patients displayed in the communal areas of the ward to be followed by both staff and patients. 5. Gardening sessions : One of our newer change ideas during the COVID-19 pandemic was to provide a safe, socially distanced space for patients to be involved in growing and caring for the Nile Ward garden with our activities co-ordinator. 6. Optimisation of Physical Exercise : Focus on physical activity through garden fitness sessions and 1-1 fitness sessions in the gym. This was another change idea commenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions occur throughout the day with our fitness instructor and enable our patients to focus on their physical health & fitness. 7. Improved Ward Environment : Gym equipment were upgraded and the appearance of the ward gymnasium was enhanced using quality art created in co-production with patients. Result There was a 43% reduction in the number of violent incidents in the ward following QI interventions. The details of the results will be depicted in pictorial form in the poster. Conclusion Our patients are able to recover in a safe environment with a reduced level of violence and aggression resulting in patients receiving less rapid tranquilisation and restrictive interventions. We have had fewer assaults on staff which has made our staff feel safer to work in a busy PICU. Staff feel more confident in their role through the use of the new risk assessment tool . Patients and staff alike have given positive feedback to the changes implemented in this QI project, with violence being successfully reduced by 43%. We hope that our QI project can be used as an example to show how QI methodology can enable Violence Reduction within mental health services.","Rahman, Mehtab, Taylor, Claudia, Abdullahi, Roda, Okwuokei, Anthony, Waugh, Matthew, Kaji, Mahomed, Magadlela, Biganani","https://www.google.com/search?q=Nile+Ward+PICU+violence+reduction+quality+improvement+project","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S213-S214, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26500,""
"Improving cardiometabolic health assessments and interventions at St Charles Hospital, London","Aims St Charles is one of the largest inpatient mental health units in London with 8 wards and covers the boroughs of Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster. This project aimed was set up so that 95% of patients in St Charles Mental Health Centre would have a complete cardiometabolic health assessment by December 2020. This would include Weight, Smoking, Alcohol, Substance Use, Hypertension, Cholesterol and Diabetes assessments with necessary interventions recorded. The outcome of the intervention would improve overall physical health and life expectancy. Method People with serious mental illness experience significantly worse physical health and shorter life expectancy of up to 10 to 15 years than the general population. CNWL is making Physical Health of patients in Mental Health Services a priority. Performance in this area has been challenging across the Trust because of: Buy in from clinicians. Staff did not feel empowered to discuss interventions with patients. High sickness and absence as a result of COVID was found to directly correlate with reduced physical health monitoring/recording. Lack of training in completing the SystmOne physical health templateThe following cardiometabolic risk monitoring interventions were recorded on SystemOne (electronic documentation platform) and performance reviewed using Tableau : Weight, Smoking, Alcohol, Substance Use, Hypertension, Cholesterol and Diabetes assessments with necessary interventions recorded. Result Prior to the commencement of this project, the wards in St Charles Mental Health Centre completed physical health assessments on roughly 8% of the patients in February 2020. The QI project was implemented in June 2020. By September 2020, physical health recording across 8 wards across St Charles had increased to 89% following successful implementation of the interventions. Conclusion The following interventions resulted in a significant improvement in physical health cardiometabolic risk monitoring at a busy inpatient mental health setting: Monthly physical heath meetings to enable shared learning with ward doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants. Ongoing one-to-one and group support to train staff with completing and recording physical health assessments. Tableau Physical Health Report regularly reviewed with MDT during ward round meetings.

"Survey of junior doctors' perspective of serious incident reviews","Aims Serious incidents according to NHS England (2015) are incidents where the consequences to patients, families and carers, staff or organisations are so significant or potential for learning are so great that a heightened response is justified. There is anectoctal evidence that this process is potentially difficult for junior doctors and the primary purpose of learning may be lost due to the stress involved. Our aim was to evaluate junior doctors perspective of serious incident reviews. A secondary aim was to organise local and regional workshops based on the outcome of our findings to address misconceptions around serious incident investigations. Method A survey was developed using survey monkey and distributed to all trainees across the Mersey region through the Medical Education teams. The junior doctors range from core trainees to higher trainees. The survey encouraged the use of free texting if necessary. Results from the survey were then analysed Result 18 junior doctors across the 3 mental health Trusts in the Mersey region responded. 12 respondents have been involved in a serious incident investigation in the past and 9 of the respondents stated that they did not recieve any support during the process. Out of the 3 that were supported, one rated the support as poor and frightening. 55.56% af all respondents found the process of serious incident reviews hard to understand. 66% of all respondents admitted that they are aware that the purpose of the review is for learning purposes. 100% of respondents agreed that a workshop to discuss the purpose and process of serious incidents investigation to aid their understanding would be useful. Conclusion From the survey, we concluded that junior doctors do have some understanding of incident reviews process but they still do not feel comfortable with the idea of being under â€˜investigation'. It is also important that formal support is made available during the process. We organised a workshop in one of the 3 Trusts which was well attended and junior doctors asked if they could sit on review panels for experiential learning. This is to be presented to govenance teams across the mental health trusts in the region. Further workshop across the 2 remaining Trusts could not be organised due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Popoola, Olusegun, Naidoo, Kuben, Shetty, Amrith","https://www.google.com/search?q=Survey+of+junior+doctors'+perspective+of+serious+incident+reviews","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S151-S151, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26502,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on referrals to liaison psychiatry services at University Hospital Hairmyres, NHS Lanarkshire","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has led to sweeping public health restrictions with predictable impact on mental health. In Scotland, lockdown measures during the first wave of the pandemic commenced on 23rd March 2020 and only began to ease after 29th May 2020. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and type of referrals made to the adult psychiatric liaison nursing service (PLNS) at University Hospital Hairmyres, NHS Lanarkshire. Method We collated all of the archived referrals made by our local emergency department to the PLNS at University Hospital Hairmyres for adults (aged 18â€“65 years) during the period of the first COVID-19 national lockdown (April-July 2020) and the corresponding period one-year prior (April-July 2019) to analyse differences in referral numbers and demographics. Additionally, for referrals made during 2020, we conducted a qualitative review of electronic records to determine the reason for referral, contributory stressors to presentation, and in particular any effect from COVID-19. Result A total of 549 referrals were made over the study period, with 320 in 2019 and 229 in 2020, a decrease of almost 30%. In 2019, referrals fell each month from April (n = 89) to July (n = 74), while this trend was reversed in 2020, rising from April (n = 45) to near-usual levels by July (n = 68). Compared to baseline, referrals in April 2020 were for a higher proportion of men (62.2%). On qualitative analysis, 26 records (11.3%) could not be found. Otherwise, the most common reasons for referral were suicidal ideation (43.3%) and/or deliberate self-harm (39.9%). Many patients presented with comorbid substance misuse (54.2%) and the majority were not known to community services (64.5%). COVID-19 was implicated in 48 referrals (23.6%), but only 2 of these arose as a direct result of infection. Conclusion We have observed clear differences in the pattern of referrals made to the adult PLNS during the first COVID-19 national lockdown. COVID-19 was implicated in a minority of referrals, but most were related to secondary effects of lockdown restrictions rather than COVID-19 infection. Possible reasons for fewer referrals during this time could be non-presentation through fears of contracting COVID-19 or altruistic avoidance of putting â€œpressure on the NHSâ€. Further studies would be insightful;in particular, equivalent analysis of contacts with community services;and qualitative patient perspectives regarding reasons for non-presentation during this time.","Paton, Cristina, Hills, James, Hegde, Rekha","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+referrals+to+liaison+psychiatry+services+at+University+Hospital+Hairmyres,+NHS+Lanarkshire","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S46-S47, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26503,""
"Changes in patients characteristics and service provision in liaison psychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to core changes in the healthcare systems worldwide in terms of access, resources and patient's management. Patients admitted to a general hospital with COVID-19 are at a higher risk for developing or exacerbating various psychiatric disorders, due to the virus brain tropism and associated psychosocial factors. However, there are still limited data regarding the psychiatric needs and mental health care of these patients. The present study seeks to evaluate the changes in liaison psychiatry, patientsâ€™ characteristics and outcomes, brought on by SARS-CoV-2. Method We retrospectively analyzed liaison psychiatry patientsâ€™ characteristics during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, between October and December 2020, in comparison with the same trimester pre-COVID-19 in 2019. Result At admission to hospital, we found no differences between liaison psychiatry pre-COVID-19 (n = 96) and COVID-19 period (n = 114) groups, for age (p = 0.35), gender (p = 0.96), or hospital resource utilization in the previous year : number of hospital admissions (p = .40), Accident and Emergency presentations (p = 0.61), outpatients clinics (p = 0.20). There was, however, a significant association between pre-COVID-19 vs COVID-19 period groups and psychiatric diagnosis during hospitalization (<U+03A7>2(5) = 11.56, p = 0.04), influencing overall respective rates of delirium/dementias (29.2 vs 42.1 %), mood disorders (18.8 vs 26.3 %), anxiety and stress related disorders (22.9 vs 14.0 %), psychoactive substance use disorders (12.5 Vs 9.6 %) and psychotic disorders (10.4 vs 2.6 %). Mortality rate in pre-COVID-19 Vs COVID-19 period increased from 5.2 % to 15.8 % (<U+03A7>2(1) = 5.98, p = 0.01), mostly due to increased mortality in COVID-19 patients (7.3 vs 30.3 %, p &lt; 0.001). Referrals to liaison psychiatry increased by 18.8 % during the COVID-19 period, 28.8 % of referred patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and time to referral was positively correlated with hospital length of stay (<U+03C1> = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001). In the COVID-19 period, fewer patients were referred to outpatient psychiatric follow-up after discharge from hospital (p &lt; 0.001), and delayed discharges for social reasons were of shorter duration (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our findings are consistent with emerging data on comorbid or superimposed mental illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, showing a strong impact in neuropsychiatric mani-festations, clinical prognosis and mortality, as well as clinical management. Consideration should also be given to adequate staffing of psychiatry liaison services during the pandemic, in order to attend and safely manage general hospital inpatients mental health needs.","Passos, Frederica, Constante, Miguel, Delgado, AndrÃ©, Heitor, Maria JoÃ£o","https://www.google.com/search?q=Changes+in+patients+characteristics+and+service+provision+in+liaison+psychiatry+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S341-S342, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26504,""
"Profile, referral pathways and re-attendance of psychiatric patients attending the emergency department: focus on suicidality & self-harm","Aims The number of patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) in the UK with acute psychiatric issues is a major concern. This project aimed to explore the outcome of patients assessed by Mental Health Liaison Services (MHLS) in a large district general hospital ED in the UK, with a focus on patients with self-harm or suicidality. Method Data were extracted from electronic patient records on 100 consecutive attendees to MHLS in July 2020. Data were collected on demographics, index of multiple deprivation (IMD) by postcode, time and reason for attendance, known ICD-10 diagnoses, self-harm history, alcohol/substance misuse at time of presentation, recent psychosocial stressors and outcome of MHLS assessment. Assessments by MHLS in the preceding 12 months and reattendance to the service within 3 months following this assessment were also recorded. Result The sample included 44 male and 56 female patients, with a mean age of 35.3 years. 80.0% of patients were Caucasian. 67.0% lived in areas classed within the top 30% most deprived in the country, whilst 2.0% had no fixed abode. The majority (79.0%) of patients self-presented;outside of normal working hours (70.0%). The most common reasons for attendance were thoughts/intent of self-harm/suicide (50.0%), overdose (29.0%) and self-harm by laceration (7.0%). The majority (73.0%) of patients had a known psychiatric diagnosis, with the most frequent being depressive disorder (36.0%) and emotionally unstable personality disorder (15.0%). Almost half (48.0%) had a history of self-harm, and 40.0% were under the influence of alcohol/illicit substances upon presentation to ED. The most common psychosocial triggers were conflict with partner (26.0%) and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic (19.0%). Following assessment, 24.0% of patients were discharged to their General Practitioner, 18.0% to the community mental health team;and 17.0% to the Crisis & Home Treatment Team. A minority (13.0%) were admitted to a psychiatric hospital (10.0% informally, 3.0% under the Mental Health Act 1983). Approximately one in five (21.0%) patients re-attended to MHLS within 3 months. Out of 37 patients that had previously been assessed by MHLS in the preceding 12 months;37.8% were reassessed within 3 months (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion In the studied sample, most (90%) of psychiatric patients attended ED for self-harm or suicide, and a significant proportion had repeat attendance. Socioeconomic deprivation, substance misuse, relationship difficulties and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues, alongside diagnosed depression and personality disorder. Focussed support for these issues may decrease ED attendance due to self-harm/suicidality.","Pandian, Haridha, Kar, Nilamadhab","https://www.google.com/search?q=Profile,+referral+pathways+and+re-attendance+of+psychiatric+patients+attending+the+emergency+department:+focus+on+suicidality+&+self-harm","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S339-S340, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26505,""
"The role of telephone consultations in psychiatry","Aims Telephone consultations have been in clinical use since the early 1960s and are increasing in frequency and importance in many areas of medicine. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the use of telemedicine consultations increased dramatically alongside utilization of other digital technologies. Despite promise and potential advantages for clinicians (including remote working, improved time management and safety) there are known drawbacks to telephone consultations for psychiatrists. This includes limitations to assessments of mental state and risk, with loss of non-verbal communication often cited as a point in favour of more sophisticated technologies such as video calling. By adopting telephone consultations to a greater extent during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Coventry Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team (CRHTT), we aimed to assess the patient experience in telehealth, through a patient survey. Method After an initial assessment or follow-up consultation with a medical practitioner from the crisis team, patients were invited to take part in a short questionnaire with a member of the administration staff. This consisted of eight questions on a Likert scale and three open questions for comments. Results were collated and analyzed via Microsoft Excel. Result Most patients found the telephone consultations satisfactory, with more than 90% returning positive scores in understanding, convenience and overall satisfaction. All patients felt listened to and that their confidentiality was maintained;with all but one respondent willing to engage in further consultations via the telephone. Negative scores were typically returned for practical telephonic problems including poor signal, interference and background noise. In their comments patients expressed largely positive views about their experience with their clinician;analysis revealed key insights into the patient experience, demonstrating the convenience, comfort and flexibility possible with â€˜telepsychiatryâ€™. Conclusion Patient experience of telemedicine in a UK psychiatric crisis team is mostly positive, with clear advantages for both patients and clinicians.

"An audit of risk assessments and management for self-harm and suicide in patients with depressive symptoms at a primary care practice in the UK","Aims Over 5 million adults in England are living with depression, with the highest prevalence rates recorded in the North West and North East of England, 12.88% and 11.53%, respectively (NHS Digital, 2019). Depression is also associated with the highest rates of self-harm and suicide (SH&S) (Singhal, Ross, Seminog, Hawton, & Goldarce, 2014). The impact of SH&S on a family ranges from shock and horror to, blame, secrecy and shame. Survivors may also be negatively judged or self-stigmatise (Cerel, Jordan, & Duberstein, 2008). Managing self-harm episodes has a significant financial implication for the NHS (Tsiachristas, et al., 2017). If high-risk individuals are identified and intervened early, it would not only save lives but also potentially reduce financial strains. The aim of the audit is to evaluate the performance of risk assessment and management of self-harm and suicide at the Reedyford Healthcare Group, Nelson, England, and to determine whether the primary care practice is meeting the standards of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for adults with depression. Method A retrospective audit of 62 patients presenting with depressive symptoms over 3 months was performed at the Reedyford Healthcare Group. Two criteria from the NICE guidelines for adults with depression were included with associated standards of 100%: All patients with depression should be assessed for suicidal ideation and intent by asking direct questions. A patient presenting with significant risk to self/others should be referred to specialist mental health services the same day, as soon as possible. Result 42 patients were asked direct questions about SH&S. 2 patients presenting with immediate risk were urgently referred to specialist services. Nonetheless, all those patients at increased risk of suicide were given an increased level of support by the practice. The results indicated that the practice could improve, and a quality improvement approach has been planned. Conclusion The assessment of risk in patients presenting with depression is vital. This audit shows that it is not always done in practice. The author has not found other published audits on this topic and suggests that this may be appropriate for a national audit. This is particularly prudent with the current concern regarding mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oo, Win Let","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+audit+of+risk+assessments+and+management+for+self-harm+and+suicide+in+patients+with+depressive+symptoms+at+a+primary+care+practice+in+the+UK","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S89-S89, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26507,""
"Social and technological innovation in Africa: sustaining a post COVID-19 research for development","This book examines the landscape of sustained investment in research and innovation in Africa, which are critical for development. This cutting-edge analysis is based on empirical evidence and the authors experience in managing health and related innovations on the continent and globally. It concludes, for the first time, that African innovation is largely driven by the principles of Social, rather than Technological innovation. The significance of this finding and the need to optimize, scale and sustain this dominant innovation is addressed in various chapters that analyze the status, challenges and opportunities. Particularly, the financing, collaboration and coordination patterns for these activities on the continent show a fragmented ecosystem that is largely dependent on external donors and aid. The importance of supportive policies, leadership and venture mechanisms that incentivizes public and private entities to innovate is further exemplified by the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic. The book proposes mechanism to address identified challenges. Dr Solomon Nwaka is a molecular biologist and innovation leader with a PhD from the University of Freiburg, Germany. He has held senior and diplomatic positions at international, public and private organizations, including WHO and MMV, Geneva Switzerland;UN/ANDI, Addis Ababa Ethiopia;IDB, Jeddah Saudi Arabia and Canadian Biotech Company.

"Where's the emergency? Improving emergency psychiatry experience for core trainees in Bath and North East Somerset (BaNES) and Gloucestershire Health and Care (GHC) localities","Aims The Royal College of Psychiatry advises that core trainees should be involved in 50 first-line emergency assessments during their core training. This includes assessment of suicidal risk following self-harm at least monthly. Trainees in Bath and Gloucester are not meeting these requirements. We set up an emergency experience rota, with the aim of increasing traineesâ€™ experience and confidence in assessment and management of emergency psychiatry. Method An emergency experience rota was implemented in Bath in September 2017. Trainees were surveyed before and after their 6 month rotations. In cycle 1, trainees spent two weeks with the Crisis team and an additional three days with the Liaison team per rotation. In cycle 2, we made some modifications to the rota so that it was more flexible. This system was then adopted in Gloucester where trainees were encountering similar difficulties. We hope to complete cycle 3 across the two localities by July 2021. Result From the initial two cycles conducted in Bath, post-change surveys showed an increase in traineesâ€™ confidence in assessments in acute settings and completing risk assessments in cases of self-harm and suicidal ideation. All of the trainees who took part would recommend the experience to other trainees (100% (7/7)). In Gloucestershire, only pre-change data have been collected so far. A full analysis of all the results will be presented. Conclusion The introduction of working time regulations such as the European Working Time Directive (2003) as well as local service reconfigurations leading to nurse-led liaison services and home treatment teams, have reduced the opportunity for trainees to undertake emergency assessments. Across the Severn Deanery, there is a discrepancy in the opportunity core traineesâ€™ have to undertake emergency assessments â€“ depending on their rota, stage of training, and services available. This difference in trainee experience, depending on locality, has been further impacted by COVID-19 and the introduction of cohorted wards. Trainees in Bath and Gloucester are predominantly covering the wards during on-calls and, therefore, we set out to ensure that they are regularly rostered to obtain emergency experience, helping them meet their core training competences. Initial results from two cycles of an emergency / out-of-hours experience rota suggest increased experience and confidence in first-line emergency assessments, enabling them to work towards meeting their core training requirements.","Nutting, Tom, Stuart, Sally, Hill, Francesca","https://www.google.com/search?q=Where's+the+emergency?+Improving+emergency+psychiatry+experience+for+core+trainees+in+Bath+and+North+East+Somerset+(BaNES)+and+Gloucestershire+Health+and+Care+(GHC)+localities","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S150-S151, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26509,""
"Psychiatric presentations in acute illness with COVID-19: a retrospective analysis","Aims To assess the psychiatric presentations in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 referred to a liaison psychiatry department during a one month period in the peak of the global pandemic. Method A retrospective analysis of the patients referred to liaison psychiatry during January 2021 who also had a diagnosis of COVID-19. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were defined as those confirmed by COVID-19 PCR in respiratory samples or clinically suspected cases from chest radiograph or CT. Severe COVID-19 was defined as those requiring supplementary oxygen due to saturations of 93% or less. Result During January 2021, a total of 24 patients were referred to liaison psychiatry with concurrent COVID-19 infection. Out of these patients, 63% had a previous mental health diagnosis. The most common reason for referral was low mood (37.5%), followed by agitation (25%) and psychosis (25%). When considering first psychiatric presentations with concurrent COVID-19 infection, the most common presentation was psychosis (44%). The time course of psychosis was most frequently seen in the seven days prior to a positive swab. In one case a patient was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for psychosis two days prior to developing symptoms. Two of these patients were worked up for possible encephalitis including radiological imaging and lumbar puncture. For patients defined as having severe COVID-19, the most common referral was low mood. In those referred for low mood, 66% had a history of an affective disorder. In two cases low mood was complicated by an acute stress reaction to recent bereavement. For one patient this included the bereavement of two relatives to COVID-19. For patients admitted to intensive care and intubated for respiratory support the most common referrals were low mood and agitation. These factors we found a barrier to successful rehabilitation following periods of significant illness. Conclusion The impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric presentations extends beyond the socio-economic factors precipitating crises across the nation. Our findings of acute psychiatric illness in the prodromal phase of the viral illness suggest a neuropsychiatric pathogenesis to COVID-19.","Nelmes, Elizabeth, Ng, Audrey","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychiatric+presentations+in+acute+illness+with+COVID-19:+a+retrospective+analysis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S44-S44, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26510,""
"The effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation of adolescents to acute mental health services in NHS Lanarkshire","Aims This project aimed to assess the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of adolescents, reflected through their presentations to A&E departments in NHS Lanarkshire. Method The psychiatry liaison database was searched for referrals of 17 year olds and under from April until August 2020. All referrals to all acute hospital sites in Lanarkshire received from any source were included. The only exclusion criteria applied were age over 17 and unavailable assessment information. The sources searched for information were: patient's electronic notes, Mental Health Assessment forms, Mental Health Risk Assessment forms and electronic letters. The following information was gathered: patient's age date, source and reason for referral hospital site of assessment outcome of assessment Result Between April and August 2020, the number of CAMHS A&E referrals increased every month except in July. The age range of CAMHS patients presenting to A&E were 12-17 years, with 17 being the most common age seen. 87% of referrals were from A&E. The two most common reasons for referrals were drug overdose and suicidal ideation. The most common outcome of assessment was a CAMHS referral. COVID-19 was a trigger for an adolescent's presentation to A&E in 31% of cases, the most common cause being struggling with the lockdown/restrictions. Conclusion The mental health charity YoungMinds carried out several surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave. They demonstrated a detrimental effect on young people's mental health in the UK. YoungMinds surveys revealed that 32% and 41% of young people experienced â€œmuch worseâ€ mental health due to COVID-19. The findings of NHS Lanarkshire were similar, with 31% of adolescents presenting to A&E as a result of COVID-19. No adolescent included in this review had contracted COVID-19 at any point. Their mental health was therefore impacted by the indirect effects of COVID-19 rather than the direct effects of infection. For the 31% of CAMHS presentations to A&E which were due to COVID-19, most young people struggled with the lockdown/restrictions. The number of presentations to A&E increased every month between April and August 2020 except for July. This could be due to people's initial fear of coming to hospital and catching COVID-19. However, as infection and death rates decreased towards the summer, people may have regarded hospitals as safer. The general increase in referrals every month may also be a reflection of the worsening of young people's mental health the longer the pandemic extended.","Nagiub, Youstina, Hegde, Rekha","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+effects+of+the+first+wave+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+the+presentation+of+adolescents+to+acute+mental+health+services+in+NHS+Lanarkshire","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S276-S277, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26511,""
"An audit comparing telephone reviews to standard face-to-face consultations within child and adolescent mental health services at Massereene House","Aims This audit was carried out in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many teams to review how they provide care to their patients. Due to attempting to reduce the spead of COVID-19, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service within the Northern Health and Social Care Trust largely switched to telephone reviews instead of face-to-face reviews for non-urgent outpatient appointments from March 2020 onwards. The aim of this audit was to establish whether or not service users found telephone reviews to be as useful and therapeutic as the previous standard face-to-face reviews. Method A questionnaire was used to assess opinions on telephone reviews. Those who were answering the questions were asked to rate their answers on the following scale: â€œnot at allâ€, â€œa littleâ€, â€œsomewhatâ€ or â€œa great dealâ€. There was an â€œany other commentsâ€ section at the end where service users could give detailed opinions on how successful they thought telephone reviews were. A sample of twenty patients was involved. This cohort of twenty patients was a mixture of ten ADHD reviews and ten medication reviews. The audit was conducted by one person and this was done via the telephone. Result For questions one to four (which will be fully outlined in the poster), the most popular category chosen was â€œsomewhatâ€ and this indicates that the majority of patients found telephone reviews somewhat better than face-to-face appointments. For question five (which was- â€œOverall, was the help you received good?â€), 80% of service users stated that the help that they received was â€œa great dealâ€ better than the help that they had received at previous face-to-face appointments. Lastly, for question six (which was- â€œIf a friend or family member needed similar help, would you recommend that they are phoned by our service?â€), 80% of service users said that they would recommend our service â€œa great dealâ€ to family members or friends. Conclusion Generally the feedback was positive for the telephone reviews. However, some still outlined a preference for face-to-face reviews. There may have been bias in this audit as it was the same doctor who did the telephone reviews as conducted the audit. To conclude, telemedicine is likely to become more popular in the future especially as the Coronavirus pandemic is still currently a worldwide problem therefore it is important to explore how service users feel about this as a way of communicating with the clinicians who are treating them.","Moss, Eileen","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+audit+comparing+telephone+reviews+to+standard+face-to-face+consultations+within+child+and+adolescent+mental+health+services+at+Massereene+House","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S93-S93, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26512,""
"Reducing the use of oral psychotropic PRN medication in acute mental health inpatients","Aims Project aim: To reduce the use of oral psychotropic PRN* medication on Ward 3 AMHIC (Acute Mental Health Inpatient Centre) by 20% by May 2020 (*PRN = Pro re nata/As required) On Ward 3, we identified a number of unintended negative consequences of PRN medication to both patients and staff. These included issues with over-use, dependence and side effects;as well as loss of staff ownership and challenging interactions with patients, (including escalation to aggression). Following the success of our Child and Adolescent Mental Health Inpatient colleagues in this area, we decided to embark on a project to change practice within our ward. Method In order to quantify the problem, we first collected baseline data on current use of psychotropic PRN medication. As a multidisciplinary project team, we then brainstormed potential contributory factors and displayed these visually as a driver diagram. This divided our project into 3 main areas: Safe prescribing Safe administration, Safety culture.Project measures were also agreed as follows: Outcome: Number of doses of oral psychotropic PRN medication administered per week Balancing: Violent incidents;IM administrations of psychotropic medication Process: Time taken to complete interventions;Patient and staff satisfaction. Change ideas were selected and implemented sequentially, using Plan-Do-Study- Act methodology. These included: Weekly review of PRN prescribing Nursing administration sheetData were collected weekly and plotted on our run chart. Result By the end of May 2020, we had exceeded our initial goal, reducing the weekly median number of doses of oral psychotropic PRN medication administered by over 30%. Our balancing measures remained stable and we gained useful insights and development ideas from a staff survey. Further change ideas were planned for implementation over the months that followed, however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the project lost some momentum. Conclusion Despite running into some difficulty over recent months, the team remain motivated to maintain and build upon our previous success. In the past few weeks, â€œCalm Cardsâ€, (a patient-centred intervention promoting use of individualised alternative coping strategies), have been introduced. We hope that the outcomes of this intervention will be positive, both in terms of further reducing use of PRN medication and encouraging development of skills which can be utilised beyond the hospital environment. We also intend to share our learning with colleagues and explore the possibility of introducing the project to other wards within the hospital.","Moore, Zoe, Morrow, Rachel, McGee, Meta","https://www.google.com/search?q=Reducing+the+use+of+oral+psychotropic+PRN+medication+in+acute+mental+health+inpatients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S210-S210, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26513,""
"A quality improvement (QI) project on improving trainee confidence in conducting remote psychiatric consultations at Pennine Care National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom (UK)","Aims When the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic hit the UK, clinicians within Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust (a five-borough mental health trust) were faced with the challenge of rapidly switching to a novel way of assessing patients remotely. The idea for a QI project on traineesâ€™ experience with remote consultations was conceived in April 2020. We present our February 2021 results here. We aimed to improve trainee confidence in conducting remote psychiatric assessments by at least 40%, to ensure effective and safe patient care during their 6 months placement. Method Our discovery process included surveying trainees in April 2020 to explore experiences with remote psychiatric consultations, a literature search of current UK guidance and a local audit. The audit reviewed documentation of consent to remote consultations, with reference to standards as per NHS England remote consultation guidance. Key change ideas included publication of an article, â€˜Remote consultations â€“ top tips for clinical practitionersâ€™, video-simulated remote consultations and a session on remote consultations in the trainee induction. In the first â€˜plan-do-study-actâ€™ (PDSA) cycle, we presented key findings from the article in a video presentation, which was sent trust-wide. We measured confidence in conducting remote assessments pre- and post-presentation via a feedback survey. Unfortunately, response rates were low and in the second PDSA cycle we targeted a smaller cohort of trainees at the August 2020 induction, although encountered similar difficulties. In the third PDSA cycle, we collected real-time data using an interactive app at the February 2021 trainee induction, and measured pre- and post- confidence following a presentation and a video-simulated remote consultation. Result 2/34 respondents had accessed previous remote psychiatric consultation training and12/35 had some telepsychiatry experience. Pre-induction trainee confidence results revealed: extremely uncomfortable (16%), not confident (31%), neutral (47%), confident (6%) and very confident (0%) and post-induction confidence was 0%, 22%, 52%, 26% and 0%, respectively. Conclusion Our project started during the first peak of the pandemic, which may be a reason for initial limited response rates. Our results suggest that the remote psychiatric consultation trainee induction session has shown some improvement in trainee confidence;the â€˜confidentâ€™ cohort improved from 6% to 26%. Our next steps include collecting similar real-time data, mid-rotation and uploading video-simulated remote consultations to the Trust Intranet. We plan to complete the local audit cycle. We also plan to incorporate patient experience (from an ongoing systematic review) to inform a potential triage process post-pandemic, choosing between face-to-face versus remote consultations.","Moir, Rachel, Ramkisson, Roshelle, Abraham, Seri, Matheiken, Shevonne","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+quality+improvement+(QI)+project+on+improving+trainee+confidence+in+conducting+remote+psychiatric+consultations+at+Pennine+Care+National+Health+Service+(NHS)+Foundation+Trust+in+the+United+Kingdom+(UK)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S209-S210, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26514,""
"Anxiety levels during COVID 19 pandemic in primary and secondary doctors in UK","Aims The study aims to examine the severity of anxiety in primary and secondary doctors in the UK during first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Method An online General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) survey was distributed during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020) to doctors in primary and secondary care in the UK. Seven closed-ended questions were included in the questionnaire. Respondents were to indicate how frequently they experienced specific issues in the previous fortnight: Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge;being unable to stop or control worrying;worrying too much generally;trouble relaxing;being so restless that it's hard to sit still;becoming easily annoyed or irritable, feeling afraid of something awful happening. Participants were required to tick one of four choices for each of the seven parameters - not at all (0), several days (1), more than half the days (2) and nearly every day (3). A person with minimal or no anxiety will score less than 5. The survey was anonymous and circulated in professional online doctors' forums. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were given. Result 273 completed surveys were received;120 doctors were in primary care and 153 were in secondary care. Average GAD7 score was 6.4 in primary care and 7.9 in secondary care. 57% of primary care doctors and 66% of secondary care doctors reported score of 5 or more, representing at least mild anxiety symptoms. 22% doctors in primary care and 31% doctors in secondary care reported GAD7 score of 10 or more, indicating moderate to severe anxiety. One in ten doctors in both primary and secondary care reported severe anxiety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion The finding of more anxiety in secondary care doctors might be because general practitioners could resort early in the pandemic to remote consultations along with inadequacy of resources, greater exposure to suffering/deaths of patients and colleagues in hospital and perceived risk of catching COVID-19 infection. Results are limited due to relatively low numbers and it would be useful to replicate this study on a larger scale. Doctors are less likely to acknowledge their mental health difficulties due to stigma associated with mental health. Many employers have psychological support systems in place for their staff, but it is questionable if affected individuals are willing to receive this support. This paper;therefore, calls for creating open anonymous platforms for professionals to get access to appropriate support to address their anxiety.","Mittal, Dr Shweta, Abouebeid, Abdalla","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety+levels+during+COVID+19+pandemic+in+primary+and+secondary+doctors+in+UK","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S52-S52, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26515,""
"How effective is clinical simulation in improving medical students' confidence when interviewing patients with mental health problems?: a comparison of pre-COVID and post-COVID medical student experiences","Aims Clinical Simulation sessions were started in April 2020 to supplement reduced patient contact for medical students at the University of Sheffield due to COVID-19 restrictions. These were run by Foundation Trainees in psychiatry with supervision and oversight from a senior psychiatrist. This study aims to review current literature on remote teaching as a learning resource and will evaluate the effectiveness of clinical simulation as an alternative to patient contact, with the focus being on improving studentsâ€™ confidence as well as developing clinical interview skills. Method Feedback surveys were developed, focussing on confidence undertaking difficult aspects of psychiatric interviews, and distributed amongst two cohorts of medical students at the University of Sheffield. One cohort completed their face-to-face psychiatry placement in full pre-COVID, the other undertook placements consisting of virtual simulation sessions alongside reduced patient contact. Responses were collected online over 6 weeks between February and March 2021. As two medical students who completed face-to-face psychiatry placement prior to the pandemic, we have additionally submitted personal reflections as a comparator to current student experiences. Result A total of 8 students in the clinical simulation cohort, and a total of 13 students from the face-to-face teaching cohort completed the questionnaire. 62.5% of students that responded were female and the remaining percentage identified as male. Students in the face-to-face cohort reported being more confident in 6 out of 7 aspects of our feedback surveys determining confidence undertaking clinical interview skills in comparison to the virtual simulation cohort. Students attended varying numbers of simulation sessions and ultimately the main restrictions and barriers to the simulation teaching reported by students are the time constraints during the sessions, and unstable internet connection. Conclusion Overall confidence levels in medical students are undoubtedly higher in students that completed full face-to-face placements in comparison to those with combined teaching. Based on student responses and review of current literature, clinical simulation appears to serve as a useful adjunct to students with reduced face-to-face contact in psychiatry, particularly for increasing confidence when interviewing more challenging patients. Immediate facilitator feedback and exposure to more difficult patient scenarios seem to be the most beneficial aspects. We would not advocate it as an exclusive form of teaching for medical students, but it may be a useful resource post-pandemic for providing students with extra learning opportunities, specifically targeted at developing confidence and skills in more difficult situations which will hopefully benefit them in their later careers.","Mitchell, Philippa, Varnish, Ella, Das, Arthita","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+effective+is+clinical+simulation+in+improving+medical+students'+confidence+when+interviewing+patients+with+mental+health+problems?:+a+comparison+of+pre-COVID+and+post-COVID+medical+student+experiences","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S273-S274, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26516,""
"COVID-19 and young people with intellectual disability: a service review","Aims A service review of specialist child and adolescent intellectual disability provision in South Wales was conducted between March and May 2020. The purpose was to explore the impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on children with intellectual disability and their families. The review aimed to explore if the disruption to the systems involved in their care would impact their wellbeing and behavioural presentations. We also measured if there had been an increase in the use of medication. Our focus was on the distress calls, which are requests for urgent clinical review to prevent a crisis.A service review of specialist child and adolescent intellectual disability provision in South Wales was conducted between March and May 2020. The purpose was to explore the impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on children with intellectual disability and their families. The review aimed to explore if the disruption to the systems involved in their care would impact their wellbeing and behavioural presentations. We also measured if there had been an increase in the use of medication. Our focus was on the distress calls, which are requests for urgent clinical review to prevent a crisis. Method Six clinical areas across three Welsh health boards under the same specialist team were surveyed. Case notes and email correspondence were reviewed to obtain the number and content of crisis calls made to specialist CAMHS across an eight week period during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Data were gathered on frequency, purpose, and outcome of calls. Comparison data were also collected for the period October 2019 to March 2020. Result Pre-COVID-19: Two crisis calls were identified in two different areas during the pre-COVID period surveyed. Increases in medication and increases in respite care packages were made as a result. During COVID-19 restrictions: 20 different initial distress calls made (children age 9 and 17 years old (M = 13.2);75% were boys) across five of the six clinical areas. Of these 20 calls, 17 were active cases and 3 were new referrals. 95% of calls resulted in medication increases and there were few other interventions used due to COVID-19 constraints. Changes to the child's support system were discussed across all cases and return to school was highlighted as a key protective factor in improved well-being. Differences between clinical areas were also identified. Conclusion There was a clear increase in distress calls and requests to prescribe or increase psychotropic medication to calm the distress during the â€˜lockdownâ€™. Changes in behavioural presentation may have occurred partly due to the disruption to the complex systems that typically support a child and the shift away from community support. Children with intellectual disability and their families are unique and embedded in complex systems comprising schools, respite, and healthcare provision which work together to deliver optimal mental healthcare with psychosocial interventions with medication for higher-risk situations. Any shifts in these systems may lead to an imbalance and a higher likelihood of medication use.","Minhas, Omer, Mundy, Pippa, Stewart, Jessica","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+young+people+with+intellectual+disability:+a+service+review","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S334-S335, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26517,""
"Physical Health Simulation Based Education (SBE) for psychiatrists in the first COVID-19 wave: improving the competence and confidence of the medical workforce","Aims At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant uncertainty for the NHS and it's workforce. Within psychiatry, there was an expectation that junior doctors would be redeployed, with senior psychiatrists stepping down to cover physical health and on-call duties. Senior leadership in mental health trusts were also preparing for COVID-19 outbreaks on psychiatric wards and were developing strategies for managing a novel illness with a poorly understood clinical course. Many psychiatrist expressed anxieties around their competency in assessing and managing acutely physically unwell patients in a mental health setting. This project aimed to improve confidence of psychiatrists in core physical health competencies through devising and delivering an evolving SBE package. Method Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust redeployed two higher trainees from their simulation faculty to work full time on developing a SBE package. This was requested by senior leadership to deliver training about assessing and managing physically unwell patients in the context of COVID-19. This training was devised as a 90 minute didactic lecture following by 90 minutes of SBE. This was delivered at 6 sites through 10 opt-in sessions available to all doctors in the trust over 4 weeks. Pre and post-course questionnaires were given to all participants to measure the effect. Result 102 medical staff attended the SBE workshops. Feedback was completed by 93 (91%) doctors prior to the course and 97 (95%) post. Before the workshop, 33% did not feel they had a structured approach for assessing an acutely unwell patient, which reduced to 0% after completing the course. On a 5-point Likert scale, confidence in managing COVID-19 symptoms increased from 2.54/5 to 4.07/5 overall with 89% of doctors feeling â€œconfidentâ€ or â€œvery confidentâ€. There were similar increases in confidence in managing critically unwell patients (2.7/5 pre;3.95/5 post) and in identifying alternative causes for acutely unwell patients (2.63/5 pre;4.02/5 post). Conclusion This project demonstrates that SBE is an effective way to rapidly develop effective interventions for the medical workforce, increasing confidence in the face of significant uncertainty and reducing anxiety within the system to meet the learning needs identified by medical leadership. As part of this project Sussex Partnership Medical Education freely shared the workshop materials, which were later adopted and used by psychiatry departments internationally.","McEwan, Craig, Kerslake, Richard, Hobkirk, Michael","https://www.google.com/search?q=Physical+Health+Simulation+Based+Education+(SBE)+for+psychiatrists+in+the+first+COVID-19+wave:+improving+the+competence+and+confidence+of+the+medical+workforce","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S147-S147, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26518,""
"Escalation of care planning on an older adult inpatient unit during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims Initial planning during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic involved difficult decision making for many clinicians. The Older Adult Mental Health Wards in Bridgend were relocated from the district general hospital (Princess of Wales) and merged at Angelton Clinic, an off site separate unit. It was therefore essential that patients had clear escalation of care plans as access to medical input was limited and transfer to hospital potentially not appropriate in the later stages of chronic illness such as dementia. The initial aim of the PDSA cycle was to assess the level of compliance with Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) discussions and if appropriate, DNAR documentation. The other aim was to assess the utilisation of Escalation of Care plans. Method An audit of patients MDT medical notes on 38 admitted to Angelton clinic was carrired out in March. It was documented if the patient had a clear DNAR or Escalation plan that was easily accessible in the front of the notes. The guidelines compared to were the GMC recommendations that patients 12 months of should have a discussion about risks and benefits associated with Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. If the patient lacks capacity a best interest decision should be made with nearest relatives. Discussions should also be had with patients and family in in regards to and transfer to a medical ward. Upon completion of the initial PDSA cycle, views were sought from the wider MDT a new escalation of care proforma was designed. This was implemented by education and communication with members of the medical team. This was to be clearly placed in the notes, with the DNAR form if that was appropriate. Result All inpatient notes were audited at Angelton Clinic in March 2020. It was found that only 18% of patients had Escalation of Care plans in comparison to 84% of notes which had DNAR forms. Previous escalation of care forms were not being utilised appropriately. Upon implementation of the Escalation of Care proforma, a re-audit of the audit cyle was completed. In July 2020 it was found that 78% of notes had completed Escalation of Care forms with 83% had completed DNAR forms. Conclusion To enable ongoing sustained improvement, the unit Nurse Practitioner will champion its completion. The audit findings have been shared with the newly rotated junior doctors and proformas were made available on all inpatient wards.","McDermott, Alexander, Rankin, Jennifer","https://www.google.com/search?q=Escalation+of+care+planning+on+an+older+adult+inpatient+unit+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S90-S91, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26519,""
"Association of COVID 19 pandemic with new onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptomology in the medical students â€“ A cross sectional study","Aims Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder, which is the sixth largest contributor to non-fatal health loss globally. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, aside from its impact on physical health, has also had its effects on mental health. This study aimed to explore the frequency of new onset OCD symptomology in medical students amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its association with potential sociodemographic parameters. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students studying in Pakistani medical colleges. Data were collected after ethical approval from 1st January 2020 to 20th January 2020 during the second COVID-19 wave. Participants with a history of diagnosed psychiatric illness such as OCD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and those taking relevant medications were excluded from the study. The online questionnaire included Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and Revised Padua Inventory-Contamination Subscale (PI-CS), which were used to assess OCD symptoms and aversion for contamination respectively. Participants filled Y-BOCS twice, once for pre-pandemic score (based on self-recall), and a second time during 2nd wave of COVID-19. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS v23.0 (Armonk, N.Y., USA). Result The study included 711 participants (Males: 29.8%, Mean age: 21.59 Â± 1.52 years) from over 46 medical colleges and over 44 cities of Pakistan. The mean pre-pandemic and mid-2nd wave Y-BOCS scores were 11.86 Â± 6.02 and 15.61 Â± 7.41 respectively. The mean PI-CS score was 17.27 Â± 9.17. Twenty five percent (n = 176) of students developed new onset OCD symptomology during pandemic, while seventy percent (n = 497) suffered from worsened Y-BOCS score during pandemic. New onset OCD symptomology was associated with age less than 20 years (p = 0.02), higher PI-CS score (p = 0.001) and studying in preclinical years (p = 0.002). Worsening of YBOCS score had significant association with female gender (p = 0.02), attending pandemic related awareness seminar (p = 0.027), studying in preclinical years (p &lt; 0.001) and age less than 20 years (p &lt; 0.001). High Padua scorers (16 and above) showed significant association with increase in YBOCS score (p &lt; 0.000), age less than 20 years (p = 0.005), preclinical years (p = 0.001), frequency of engagements in pandemic related discussions (p = 0.001) and change in YBOCS score (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Our findings indicate that the prevalence of OCD symptomology increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as demonstrated by increased Y-BOCS scores.Femal medical students and students in preclinical years are more likely to suffer from psycological impact of COVID-19 pandemic and heightened concerns and fear for contamination.","Mazhar, Khadija, Khaliq, Fatima, Arshad, Daneyal","https://www.google.com/search?q=Association+of+COVID+19+pandemic+with+new+onset+Obsessive-Compulsive+Disorder+(OCD)+symptomology+in+the+medical+students+â€“+A+cross+sectional+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S270-S270, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26520,""
"Improving the physical healthcare of COVID-19 patients in inpatient psychiatric settings","Aims COVID-19 can spread rapidly in psychiatric inpatient settings. Previous studies have found that patients have a higher risk of hospitalisation and death than adults in the community. The aim of this project was to improve the care of patients with COVID-19 in psychiatric inpatient settings. Method A baseline audit was conducted of care COVID-19 patients received in wards that experienced outbreaks in January 2021 in a London Mental Health Trust. Clinical notes were reviewed for management plans, including clear documentation of risk of serious illness, frequency of vitals monitoring, and thresholds for escalation to medical teams. A new protocol was subsequently developed and implemented at one inpatient unit: â€œCOVID-19: Early Identification of Risk and Managementâ€. This included an adjusted 4C mortality score to determine risk of deterioration, and schedules for observation monitoring based on this outcome. Each schedule specified separate frequencies of monitoring of critical observations (oxygen saturations, respiratory rate) and routine observations, thus minimising unnecessary staff exposure. It prompted venous thromboembolism (VTE) assessment and documentation of escalation criteria. Result 44 patients were identified across three working age (WAA, n = 29) and two older age (OA, n = 15) adult wards. 7.5% of WAA and 33.3% of OA patients were hospitalised. 20% of OA patients died following a positive test. 58% of patients had a documented management plan for COVID-19, but only 56% mentioned observation frequency, 19% escalation criteria, and 9% risk of serious disease. No patient received a repeat VTE assessment following diagnosis. The audit identified inconsistent approaches to COVID-19 management between wards, and found no relationship between risk of deterioration and frequency of observation monitoring. Following implementation of this protocol, 100% (n = 4) of patients had a robust plan for COVID-19 management, and 100% received a VTE assessment. Conclusion The audit supported previous findings that psychiatric inpatients are at risk of serious COVID-19 infection. This highlights an urgent clinical and ethical need to optimise COVID-19 care in psychiatric inpatient settings. The results of this audit suggest that risk factors for severe infection and elements of routine care are not widely understood or implemented by clinical staff. Introducing evidence-based protocols to support clinicians in managing the physical healthcare of these patients may be one way of promoting best practice. The improvement in care observed in the pilot study has resulted in this protocol being rolled out across the Trust in an ongoing quality improvement project.","Lewis, Marissa, Dionelis, Karolos, Vecida, Miguel, Phelps, Rebecca, Hopwood, Helen, Yong, Lawrence, Ng, Jason, Veeramah, Sara, Lloyd, Miranda, Clark, Tom","https://www.google.com/search?q=Improving+the+physical+healthcare+of+COVID-19+patients+in+inpatient+psychiatric+settings","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S204-S205, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26521,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on referrals for physical and mental health care","Aims To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on referrals to mental health and physical health services. Method We analysed referral data from three psychiatric services in the boroughs of Camden and Islington across 2018-2020: Early Intervention Services (for patients with a 1st episode of psychosis), Crisis Resolution Teams and inpatient admissions. We also analysed GP referral data to Cancer Services (two-week wait referrals) to Whittington Hospital, Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital (all of North Central London). We examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these referrals and compared the findings between physical and mental health. We chose to use EIS and Cancer services as comparable services since they both operate with the two-week target of achieving diagnosis of psychosis and cancer respectively. Result The number of referrals to EIS and CRT both decreased to 61% in April 2020 with respect to their baseline;EIS referrals continued to decrease to 48% in May before starting to recover. Inpatient admissions saw a smaller reduction to 87% in April 2020. The number of cancer two-week wait referrals similarly decreased and reached a trough of 37% in April 2020. The rate of recovery back to the baseline number of referrals and admissions relative to previous years differed between services, with acute care recovering faster. Referrals to CRT and inpatient admissions recovered by 98% and 115% respectively by June 2020;comparatively, referrals to EIS recovered to 102% by December 2020. In contrast, cancer two-week wait referrals returned to 106% by September 2020, a rate faster than EIS, but slower than CRT and inpatient admissions. Conclusion The reduction in the number of referrals across all examined services correlated with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate of decrease was similar across all services, coinciding with the peak of COVID-19 infections. However, the ultimate degree of decrease and following rate of recovery in numbers differed across both psychiatric and non-psychiatric services. These differences likely have multifactorial origins. The authors discuss contributing factors, such as changes in health seeking behaviours observed during the pandemic, potential impact of reduction in face to face consultations in primary care, as well as temporary changes in the population demographic of Camden and Islington resulting in absent target groups (i.e. students who make up a large proportion of referrals to EIS opting to return home). It remains important to not neglect mental health and face a hidden epidemic once COVID-19 pandemic settles.","Lekkos, Petros, Thorpe, Joanna, Obeney-Williams, Janet, Xing, Fiona","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+referrals+for+physical+and+mental+health+care","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S88-S89, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26522,""
"Evaluation of physical health assessments for new admissions to the Oleaster during the first wave of COVID-19","Aims Physical health of psychiatric inpatients is worse than the general population. Physical health monitoring of these patients can have positive effects on outcomes. Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust (BSMHFT) states that a physical health assessment (PHA) should be completed within 72 hours of admission. This comprises a physical health form (PHF) and minimum data set (MDS): BP, BMI, TB and BBV status, alcohol and drug screen, smoking status, Hba1c and lipids. In a 2017 audit, compliance was shown to need improvement, with 28.3% of admissions not having a PHF documented. Objectives To assess whether PHAs for new admissions to the Oleaster, Birmingham during the first wave of COVID-19 were completed in line with trust policy To compare findings with a previous audit To make recommendations to improve inpatient physical health and compliance with trust policy Method A retrospective audit was conducted, with PHA details accessed via the electronic medical records system RiO. Admissions from 16/03/2020-30/06/2020 were accessed and 158 admissions (155 patients) were included. 21 admissions were excluded as they were internal transfers;only data from the initial admission were included. Data were collected by 2 medical students and a psychiatry trainee using a data collection tool. Data were recorded and analysed on Excel. Result Of 158 admissions, 81 had PHFs (51.3%). 59 were completed within 72 hours of admission (34.3%);39 were completed fully (24.7%). Of incomplete PHFs, 2 explicitly stated incompletion due to COVID-19. 22 PHFs were created but not completed within 72 hours. 15 gave a deferral reason e.g., refusal to consent or agitation. For 77 admissions (47.3%), no assessment was documented, with no reason given. 2 admissions (1.3%) recorded the full MDS within 72 hours of admission. 2 admissions (1.3%) had fully complete PHAs (PHF and MDS) within 72 hours of admission, fulfilling trust policy. Conclusion 51.3% of admissions had a PHF, with 34.3% documented within 72 hours of admission. However, only 1.3% of admissions fulfilled trust policy of both a completed PHF and MDS within 72 hours of admission. There were more admissions without a PHF than in the previous 2017 audit;47.33% compared to 28.3% previously. Given trust targets that a PHA should be fully completed for 100% of admissions, it was found that the Oleaster did not meet these guidelines during this period and improvements must be made to maintain integrity of patient care.","Lawson-Smith, Erin, Sutherland, Danielle, Brookes, Eleanor, Zhang, Alex, George, Joji","https://www.google.com/search?q=Evaluation+of+physical+health+assessments+for+new+admissions+to+the+Oleaster+during+the+first+wave+of+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S88-S88, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26523,""

Stressors related to insecurity, unpredictability, patient death and family distress are significant, and put healthcare workers (HCWs) at high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aims of this study were to measure the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in HCWs and to identify risk factors and protective factors during the epidemic in France. Methods During the first peak of the epidemic (from 22 April to 13 May 2020), we assessed sources of stress (PS-ICU scale), mental health (GHQ-12) and coping strategies (Brief-COPE). Three months later (03 June to 6 July 2020), PTSD was assessed using the IES-R scale, with additional questions about sources of support. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires administered online. Results Among 2153 professionals who participated in the study, 20.6% suffered from potential PTSD, mostly intrusion symptoms. Risk factors for the development of PTSD were having experienced additional difficult events during the crisis, having a high level of psychological distress, a high level of perceived stress related to the workload and human resources issues, the emotional burden related to the patient and family, and stressors specific to COVID-19 during the first peak of the crisis. The use of positive thinking coping strategies decreased the relationship between perceived stress and the presence of PTSD, while social support seeking strategies increased the relationship. Finally, the HCWs preferred to use support from colleagues, relatives and/or a psychologist, and very few used the telephone hotlines. Conclusion The epidemic has had a strong traumatic impact on intensive care HCWs. Given the risk of PTSD, we need to consider implementing easily-accessible support services that focus on positive thinking coping strategies, during and after the crisis. HIGHLIGHTS The risk of PTSD is high among intensive care professionals. Perceived stress and psychological distress during the first peak of crisis increased the likelihood of subsequent PTSD. Support for professionals should be easily available and focused on positive thinking strategies.","Laurent, Alexandra, Fournier, Alicia, Lheureux, Florent, Poujol, Anne-Laure, Deltour, Victoire, Ecarnot, Fiona, Meunier-Beillard, Nicolas, Loiseau, MÃ©lanie, Binquet, Christine, Quenot, Jean-Pierre","https://www.google.com/search?q=Risk+and+protective+factors+for+the+possible+development+of+post-traumatic+stress+disorder+among+intensive+care+professionals+in+France+during+the+first+peak+of+the+COVID-19+epidemic+Factores+de+riesgo+y+factores+protectores+para+el+posible+desarrollo+de+un+trastorno+de+estrÃ©s+postraumÃ¡tico+en+profesionales+de+cuidados+intensivos+en+Francia+durante+la+primera+ola+de+la+pandemia+por+la+COVID-19+<U+5728>+COVID-19+<U+75AB><U+60C5><U+7B2C><U+4E00><U+4E2A><U+9AD8><U+5CF0><U+671F><U+95F4>,+<U+6CD5><U+56FD><U+91CD><U+75C7><U+76D1><U+62A4><U+4E13><U+4E1A><U+4EBA><U+5458><U+53EF><U+80FD><U+53D1><U+751F><U+521B><U+4F24><U+540E><U+5E94><U+6FC0><U+969C><U+788D><U+7684><U+98CE><U+9669><U+548C><U+4FDD><U+62A4><U+56E0><U+7D20>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 13(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26524,""
"Post traumatic growth during COVID-19: unity in diversity","Aims This poster reflects how the experience of staying with people of diverse nations and cultural background helped the stranded IMGs cope with this agony in a foreign land during an unprecedented tumultuous situation. The aim is to show that despite diversity among people, the hard times made them unite and overcome countless difficulties. Background The COVID 19 pandemic has been a period of global health crisis and has exponentially affected mental health issues in the world population. In these difficult times, several International Medical Graduates (IMGs), who had come to the UK to attend their PLAB exams, were left stranded as the exams were postponed, flights cancelled and borders sealed. Faced with huge uncertainty their mental health was of great concern. At this time the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) came forward to help this cohort of stranded doctors in terms of accommodation, finances, mental health support, preparation for exams to the extent of liaising with General Medical Council (GMC) and Home Office. The virtual support group provided a platform for IMGs from different nations and cultures to get in touch with each other helping overcome mental burden and stress. The stories presented in the poster show how unity in diversity helped these young doctors deal with mental trauma amidst the Pandemic. Method 276 doctors from 27 countries were looked after by BAPIO. From those excerpts taken from 26 IMGs, personal narratives was used as a method for qualitative assessment. The percentage of IMGs clearing their exams and getting jobs in the NHS has been used for quantitative assessment. Result Qualitative: The personal narratives of the IMGs show how they were positively impacted by staying together albeit different nationalities and cultural background. Quantitative: A total of 21 IMGs out of the 26 cleared their PLAB 2 exams and got registration under General Medical Council giving a percentage of 81.7%. 20 IMGs have successfully joined the NHS in various posts giving a job success rate of 95.2%. Conclusion The experience of living and sharing housings with people from different nationalities, has increased appreciation and also prepared them to work in the NHS which has a diverse work force. This learning experience has been integral for all of us in shaping our life in the UK making everyone more compassionate.","Lakha, Meena Afzal, Bhowmik, Anindya, Bisht, Sneha, Shrestha, Suzani, Gajanan, Kantappa, Shah, Samir","https://www.google.com/search?q=Post+traumatic+growth+during+COVID-19:+unity+in+diversity","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S2-S2, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26525,""

"Factors associated with mental health outcomes among medical residents exposed to COVID-19","Aims The aims of our study were to assess and to examine i. the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical residents working on the front and second line, ii. the association between coping strategies, resilience and optimism and different mental health outcomes like stress, anxiety, and depression among the medical residentsâ€™ workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and iii. the coping strategies used on the same sample with consideration of different factors like seniority, frontliner, gender and coping style. Method An electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale â€“ 21 Items. Professional quality of life was measured by the Professional Quality of Life measure. The coping mechanisms were assessed with the Brief-COPE, resilience by the Brief Resilience Scale, and optimism by the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). Result Of the 640 medical residents contacted, 127 (20%) responded. A considerable proportion of residents reported symptoms of depression (42.5%), anxiety (41.7%) and stress (30.7%). Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant effects of seniority in residency, with junior residents having poorer outcomes. In addition, there was a statistically significant interaction effect with moderate effect sizes between gender and working on the front line, as well as gender, working on the front line and seniority, on mental health outcomes. The most commonly used coping strategies were acceptance, religion, and active coping. The least reported coping strategies were substance use and denial. Avoidant coping style scores were higher among junior residents (p = .032) and non-COVID-19 frontliners (p = .039). Optimism LOT-R score was higher in senior than in junior residents (p &lt; .001). Another important finding is that optimism and resilience were associated with better mental health outcomes. In addition, we find that avoidant coping style is highly associated with depression. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on junior residentsâ€™ mental health. Preventive measures to reduce stress levels and easy access to professional mental health services are crucial. This study also raises awareness among residency programs on the psychological and coping responses and strategies of medical residents.","Khoodoruth, Mohamed Adil Shah, Ouanes, Sami, Smida, Malek, Al-Salihy, Zerak, Nuaimi, Saleem Al, Khoodoruth, Widaad Nuzhah Chut-kai, Ghaffar, Adeel, Mohammed, Mohammed Faisal Hamad","https://www.google.com/search?q=Factors+associated+with+mental+health+outcomes+among+medical+residents+exposed+to+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S232-S232, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26527,""
"Survey of remote consultations in psychiatry during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak","Aims To compare the usage of remote consultations before and after the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and explore mental health workersâ€™ views on the usage of telemedicine. Method An online questionnaire survey was developed, and disseminated to mental healthcare professionals via e-mail and social media. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's six step procedure for thematic analysis.1 Result There were 40 responses from mental healthcare professionals of varying grades from different sub-specialties, predominantly from the UK. Compared to before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, there was an increase in usage of telephone (9(22.5% to (29)72.5%) and video consultations (4(10%) to 17(42.5%)). Respondents reported an increase in virtual MDTs (35(87.5%) during the pandemic, 9(22.5%) pre-pandemic). Based on a 5-point Likert scale, the mean technical quality of telephone consultations was 3.56/5 (Range 2-5), with 75% rating telephone consultations as not being as good as face-to-face consultations. The mean technical quality of video consultations was 3.58/5 (Range 2-5), with 63% rating video consultations as not being as good as face-to-face consultations. 25 (62.5%) respondents felt comfortable using telephone consultations during the pandemic, 20(50%) felt comfortable using video consultations. Recurring themes identified from the qualitative data regarding reasons for the technical quality ratings were: connection issues, poor infrastructure and security concerns. Nine (23%) respondents felt that using video conferencing consultations had a detrimental impact on the mental health of patients while 14(35%) felt that telephone consultations had a detrimental impact on patientsâ€™ mental health. Recurring themes for health practitionersâ€™ perceived effect of the use of telemedicine on patientsâ€™ mental heath were the loss of personal touch and reduced patient engagement. Conclusion There was a substantial increase in usage of remote consultations during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among mental healthcare professionals. The results reported in the present study suggest there are numerous barriers to the use of telemedicine in psychiatry, which require future exploration, ideally through interview or ethnographic studies.","Khodabux, Nusra, Gangadharan, Satheesh, Tromans, Samuel, Hiremath, Avinash","https://www.google.com/search?q=Survey+of+remote+consultations+in+psychiatry+during+the+SARS-CoV-2+outbreak","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S264-S265, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26528,""
"The Staff Mental Health Service in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough: a new model for assessment and treatment of healthcare workers in the context of COVID-19 pandemic","Aims Staff mental health is a major determinant of a well-functioning health system that has become ever more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor mental health is the most common reason for NHS staff sickness absences, usually accounting for 25% of all reported sick leave. At a time when the NHS most needs an available and efficient workforce, government and NHS employers lack the necessary evidence to inform decisions about how best to support the mental health needs of its staff. In this report, we share our experience and the initial figures from a newly developed multidisciplinary assessment and treatment service for NHS staff. Method The Staff Mental Health Service (SMHS) at the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) launched in September 2020. The SMHS is commissioned by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough sustainability and transformation partnership and is accessible to the 25,513 staff based at five NHS trusts within the region. The service received 235 referrals within 5 months of the launch. All patients had a first clinical contact within three working days and more than 80% had their initial assessment within two weeks. The SMHS clinical team is comprised of consultant psychiatrists, senior clinical psychologists, specialist mental health nurses, and an occupational health nurse set to provide rapid access, confidential, evidence-based treatments for the NHS staff. As part of service evaluation within CPFT, we collected routine screening data (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Posttraumatic Symptom Check List â€“ 6 (PCL-6)) from patients completing the initial assessment (n = 130). Result According to the initial figures (n = 130) from a diverse group of healthcare staff, on average the patients presented with moderate level of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: 16.22 Â± 5.94). Anxiety levels were in moderate to severe range (GAD-7: 13.45 Â± 4.70). Average score of PCL-6 checklist for traumatic stress symptoms was higher than the established cut-off (&gt;14): 19.43 Â± 5.65. Conclusion The Staff Mental Health Service offers an innovative, multi-disciplinary rapid assessment and treatment clinic for NHS staff. The demand for the service has been immense, reaching double the number of predicted referrals. Initial data suggested high rates of moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers. Our clinical observations was that many healthcare workers have had longstanding significant mental health conditions that saw deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that our experience in the SMHS will help inform models across the UK to address the clear unmet need for staff mental health.","Kaser, Muzaffer, Martin, Zoe, Walsh, Cathy","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Staff+Mental+Health+Service+in+Cambridgeshire+and+Peterborough:+a+new+model+for+assessment+and+treatment+of+healthcare+workers+in+the+context+of+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S33-S34, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26529,""
"Burnout and Interventions for Healthcare workers to cope during COVID-19","Aims Healthcare workers are exposed to both physical and mental demands in the hospital environment;recently intensified by overstretching staff and resources during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Despite healthcare workers banding together, physician burnout is more prevalent than ever before due to emotional, physical and mental exhaustion. Firstly, this poster aims to expose the prevalence of burnout among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, to highlight the interventions and strategies to help minimise burnout among healthcare workers. Method I will focus on reviewing clinical trials with a particular focus on healthcare workers affected by burnout within the COVID-19 pandemic timeframe. Therefore, narrowing my search to 20 trials within the past 12 months using the following restricted search criteria: â€˜burnoutâ€™, â€˜covid-19â€™ and â€˜healthcareâ€™. Furthermore, commenting on strategies and interventions to minimise burnout by stretching my criteria to interventions trialled within the last 24 months. This is due to limited data and trial evidence for burnout strategies within the last 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Result Burnout is on the rise among healthcare workers across the globe, 47% of healthcare staff are expressing an element of burnout worldwide. With growing concerns of healthcare staff developing long term mental health implications as a result of work-related stress. At present, one third of frontline staff are experiencing depression and distress;which must be addressed. Reviewing recent trials has highlighted a number of successful strategies for approaching burnout including: app technology, talking therapy, staff support and internet-based resources. App-related technology and web resources have shown to be particularly beneficial among recent trials, with limited participation and engagement for support groups/talking therapy. Conclusion A significant rise in physician burnout and distress during COVID-19 has been noted in various trials. Interventions specifically related to burnout within COVID-19 are limited due to a low yield of completed trials;however, a couple of trials have found an improvement in COVID-19 related stress among healthcare workers using app-related technology. Internet based intervention is cheap, widely accessible and a non-judgemental method for seeking help, especially within a profession where burnout is heavily stigmatized.","Kailey, Harnek","https://www.google.com/search?q=Burnout+and+Interventions+for+Healthcare+workers+to+cope+during+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S143-S143, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26530,""

Those who have recovered from COVID-19 may experience discrimination and internalized stigma. They may be more likely to worry about social interaction and develop social anxiety. Objectives This study investigated the associations among hospitalization factors, social/interpersonal factors, personal factors, and social anxiety to reveal the mechanism of social anxiety in COVID-19 survivors. Methods A cross-sectional, multicenter telephone survey was conducted from July to September 2020 in five Chinese cities (i.e. Wuhan, Nanning, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Dongguan);adult COVID-19 survivors were recruited 6 months after they were discharged from the hospital. Linear regressions and path analysis based on the minority stress model were conducted to test the relationships among hospitalization, social/interpersonal factors, personal factors, and social anxiety. Results The response rate was 74.5% (N =Â 199, 55.3% females). Linear regression analyses showed that various hospitalization, social/interpersonal, and personal factors were statistically significantly associated with social anxiety. Path analysis showed that the proposed model fit the data well (<U+03C7>2(df)Â =Â 3.196(3), p =Â .362, CFIÂ =Â .999, NNFIÂ =Â .996, RMSEAÂ =Â .018). Internalized stigma fully mediated the association between perceived discrimination/social support and social anxiety, while it partially mediated the association between perceived affiliate stigma and social anxiety. Conclusions The results suggest that social/interpersonal and personal factors have a stronger association with social anxiety than hospitalization factors and highlight the importance of internalized stigma in understanding the mechanisms of these relationships. Clinical psychologists can refer to these modifiable psychosocial factors to develop efficient interventions for mental health promotion. HIGHLIGHTS Internalized stigma fully mediated the effects of perceived discrimination and social support on social anxiety and partially mediated the effect of perceived affiliate stigma on social anxiety.","Ju, Niu, Yang, Xue, Ma, Xiaojun, Wang, Bingyi, Fu, Leiwen, Hu, Yuqing, Luo, Dan, Xiao, Xin, Zheng, Weiran, Xu, Hui, Fang, Yuan, Chan, Paul Shing Fong, Xu, Zhijie, Chen, Ping, He, Jiaoling, Zhu, Hongqiong, Tang, Huiwen, Huang, Dixi, Hong, Zhongsi, Xiao, Fei, Sun, Fengxia, Hao, Yanrong, Cai, Lianying, Yang, Jianrong, Ye, Shupei, Chen, Yao-Qing, Yuan, Jianhui, Wang, Zixin, Zou, Huachun","https://www.google.com/search?q=Hospitalization,+interpersonal+and+personal+factors+of+social+anxiety+among+COVID-19+survivors+at+the+six-month+follow-up+after+hospital+treatment:+the+minority+stress+model+HospitalizaciÃ³n,+factores+interpersonales+y+personales+de+ansiedad+social+entre+los+sobrevivientes+de+COVID-19+en+el+seguimiento+seis+meses+despuÃ©s+del+tratamiento+hospitalario:+el+modelo+de+estrÃ©s+de+minorÃ­a+<U+57FA><U+4E8E><U+5C11><U+6570><U+7FA4><U+4F53><U+538B><U+529B><U+6A21><U+578B><U+7684><U+65B0><U+51A0><U+5EB7><U+590D><U+8005><U+4F4F><U+9662><U+7ECF><U+5386>,+<U+51FA><U+9662><U+540E><U+516D><U+4E2A><U+6708><U+4EBA><U+9645><U+53CA><U+4E2A><U+4EBA><U+56E0><U+7D20><U+4E0E><U+793E><U+4EA4><U+7126><U+8651><U+4E4B><U+95F4><U+7684><U+5173><U+8054><U+5206><U+6790>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 13(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26531,""
"Communication in COVID: a quality improvement project into staff communication with family/carers at New Haven Older Adult Mental Health Inpatient Unit","Aims In the psychiatric care of patients, family involvement is key to recovery. At the New Haven Unit, there have been a number of complaints regarding poor communication and lack of updates given to families during COVID-19. The aim is to: To increase the overall satisfaction of the family with the service received for their loved ones Ensure effective and timely communication of updates to the families, to prevent further complaints, by assigning a member of staff per patient to be the primary individual responsible for family contact Create an addition to the weekly ward round MDT proforma on â€˜Carenotesâ€™ where communication can be documented Method A standardised questionnaire has been sent to the relatives of inpatients at the New Haven Unit. Qualitative data are being collated, which will lead to quantitative statistical analysis of the satisfaction ratings. Based on the current bed state on the ward at the time of the project all 32 relatives of current inpatients were contacted and 23 agreed to complete the survey which was sent out either by email or post. The new MDT proforma will be added, which will be used to record actions needed to be taken involving communication and updating family members on a weekly basis. This opportunity to record communication will improve continuity of care and satisfaction amongst family members. There will be follow-up via a second questionnaire to identify improvement. Result The average results of selected categories so far are shown below (still awaiting further responses): Frequency of updates regarding loved ones = 4.33/10 (10-excellent) To what degree were your concerns listened to? 7.33/10 Quality of content discussed with staff members = 3.33/4 (4- excellent) Other categories scoring below the expected standard, included awareness of visiting guidelines and questions regarding lasting power of attorney, in which 33.3% of participants responded either â€˜noâ€™ or â€˜not sureâ€™ respectively. Questions addressing formalities of introduction and confidentiality through identity confirmation, scored highly. Conclusion We are awaiting more survey responses in order to identify additional areas of improvement;however, it is already clear to see that there are areas that would be advanced through structured, assigned reminders via an MDT amendment. We will also be introducing set dates for conference calls with the families now involving the whole MDT;one within the first week of admission, one after six weeks and one at the point of discharge as a minimum.","Jones, Felicity, Khanna, Bhavna, Almoosawi, Batool, Humm, Alex, Mahon, Upjeet, Edwards, Rosie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Communication+in+COVID:+a+quality+improvement+project+into+staff+communication+with+family/carers+at+New+Haven+Older+Adult+Mental+Health+Inpatient+Unit","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S199-S199, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26532,""
"Referrals to liaison services for older adults with deliberate self harm during the SARS-CoV-2 national lockdown - a collaborative service evaluation using liaison referral data","Aims Social isolation and living alone have been associated with increased suicidality in older adults. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, older adults were advised to keep isolated and maintain social distancing. Lockdown periods in England may have led to increased isolation and loneliness in older people, possibly resulting in an increased rates of DSH and suicide. This study aimed to explore whether numbers of older adults referred to liaison services with deliberate self harm changed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Method Reason for referral and total number of referrals to liaison services for older adults data were collected across 6 mental health trusts who had access to robust data sets. Data were collected prospectively for three months from the start of the UK national lockdown and for the corresponding 3 month period in 2019, via trust reporting systems. This study was registered as service evaluation within each of the participating mental health trusts. Result Overall numbers of referrals to older adult liaison services went down, but the proportion of referrals for older adults with DSH increased. Across the six mental health trusts there there were a total of 2167 referrals over the first three month lockdown period in 2020, and 170 (7.84%) of these referrals were for deliberate self harm. During a corresponding time period in 2019, there were a total of 3416 referrals and 155 (4.54%) of these referrals were for deliberate self harm Conclusion Although numbers of referrals for older adults with delberate self harm appeared to stay the same, the severity of these presentations is not clear. Outcomes of referrals and severity of self harm could be explored by examining individual case records. As there have been subsequent lockdowns the data collection period should also be extended to include these. Triangulation with national and local datasets on completed suicide is planned.","Jenkinson, Josie, Junaid, Kehinde, Ormerod, Sara, Sahu, Sunita, Grant-Peterkin, Hugh, Daher, Mazen, Lee-Davey, James, Yetkil, Atilla, Beezhold, Julian, Leddy, Adrian, Sampson, Elizabeth, Chowdhury, Tasnia, Babar, Bushra, Visvaratnam, Parrthiepan, Vamathevan, Divya, Deylami, Rogin, Sawle, Tristan, Delaney, Mollie, Qureshi, Ahoane, Rahman, Rabeya, Sharma, Neelam, Pabani, Kareem, Hubbett, Jack, Takao, Yuki, Hanton, Ellie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Referrals+to+liaison+services+for+older+adults+with+deliberate+self+harm+during+the+SARS-CoV-2+national+lockdown+-+a+collaborative+service+evaluation+using+liaison+referral+data","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S33-S33, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26533,""
"The impact of first COVID-19 peak on patient referrals to Liaison Psychiatry Service and staff perception about service provision in Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust Birmingham - a service evaluation project","Aims Based on recommendations from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, this project aimed to evaluate the impact of the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic on referral patterns to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB) Liaison Psychiatry (LP) service. Additionally, we aimed to explore staff experiences in LP services across Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (BSMHFT) in order to generate Trust recommendations promoting optimal healthcare provision amidst the on-going pandemic. Method A mixed method service evaluation was conducted using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Quantitative methods involved reviewing referrals made to the QEHB LP service from March to June 2020, compared with the equivalent time period in 2019. Data were retrospectively extracted from the electronic clinical databases RIO and PICS, and subsequently analysed using Microsoft Office. The number of, and reasons for referrals to LP were identified, whilst focus groups were conducted to explore the subjective experiences of staff working across BSMHFT LP services. Result Between 1st March and 30th June 2020, 984 referrals were made to the QEHB LP service, compared to 1020 referrals in 2019, representing a 3.5% reduction. From 2019 to 2020, referrals due to psychotic symptoms and deliberate self-harm rose by 12.8% and 14.1% respectively, whilst referrals for drug and alcohol-related causes reduced by 28.3%. A significant increase (150%) in referrals for medication or management advice was seen. Focus groups indicated that staff perceived an initial reduction in number of referrals, but an increase in the acuity of patient presentations. Staff reported anxiety around contracting and transmitting SARS-Cov-2, exacerbated by uncertainty around patientsâ€™ COVID-19 status. In QEHB, sixty-five of the 984 referrals (7%) had a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR swab, with the remaining 919 referrals being either negative (68%) or unknown (25%). Ninety-six percent of consultations were conducted face-to-face in QEHB. There were conflicting views amongst staff regarding whether more consultations could have been conducted remotely. Furthermore, varying perceptions of support and communication from both the physical and mental health trust were reported. Conclusion Quantitative data indicates that COVID-19 impacted LP healthcare provision in BSMHFT. Whilst referral numbers remained similar between the equivalent period in 2019 and 2020, a change in the nature of referrals to LP at QEHB was seen. This was corroborated by qualitative data which highlighted a perceived change in acuity of referrals. These findings have been disseminated across the Trust and subsequent recommendations are being implemented during the on-going pandemic.","Jehanzeb, Saima, Suleman, Muhammad, Tumelty, Ella, Okusanya, Joanne, Karunanithy, Laxsan, Thomas, Lucretia, Marshall, Rebecca, Bagchi, Dhruba, Hashmi, Mahnaz","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+first+COVID-19+peak+on+patient+referrals+to+Liaison+Psychiatry+Service+and+staff+perception+about+service+provision+in+Birmingham+and+Solihull+Mental+Health+Trust+Birmingham+-+a+service+evaluation+project","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S329-S329, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26534,""
"â€œLost between the interface of physical and mental healthâ€: focus groups exploring liaison psychiatry staff's perception about working during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust","Aims As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, increasing attention is being drawn to the welfare of healthcare providers who have endured many months of sustained exposure to the virus, disrupted working conditions and psychological stress. This project aimed to explore the subjective experiences of staff working in Liaison Psychiatry (LP) in the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust, (BSMHFT) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have been used to devise recommendations for subsequent waves. Method Data collection occurred as part of a mixed method service evaluation project. We invited all clinical and non-clinical staff from LP departments across BSMHFT to participate in focus groups conducted via Microsoft Teams. The focus groups were video-recorded and facilitated by a moderator and an observer. Subsequent anonymised transcripts were coded and themes were generated by at least two evaluators, using thematic analysis. Result The focus groups, which ranged from 21 to 69 minutes, involved consultants, junior doctors and nurses from four hospitals within BSMHFT. Six major themes emerged including an initial reduction in number yet increase in acuity of patients seen by LP, with some perception that this resulted from reduced face-to-face contact with community mental health services. A feeling that LP was lost at the interface between the physical and mental health trusts emerged as another theme. Uncertainty in adapting to unprecedented working conditions, for example, unclear guidance concerning the use of personal protective equipment, was also described alongside anxiety about contracting and transmitting SARS-Cov-2. Additionally, increased pressure was felt due to staff shortages and inadequate inter-departmental communication. Participants reported differential uptake of remote working, as well as conflicting views regarding the feasibility of remote assessments in LP. Conclusion Liaison psychiatry staff within BSMHFT continued to provide a crucial service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Focus groups with thes staff indicate several recommendations for implementation within the Trust and provoke questions for future research. Due to the unique role that LP plays in providing mental health care within general hospitals, clear guidance for LP staff is key for effective service provision and supporting LP staff. Although used widely across community mental health services, the role of remote working in LP is contentious and requires further exploration. However, there are limitations to the use of focus groups and these findings may not fully represent the experiences of LP staff throughout BSMHFT. Different themes may have emerged through the use of anonymous questionnaires.","Jehanzeb, Saima, Suleman, Muhammad, Tumelty, Ella, Okusanya, Joanne, Karunanithy, Laxsan, Thomas, Lucretia, Bagchi, Dhruba, Hashmi, Mahnaz","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€œLost+between+the+interface+of+physical+and+mental+healthâ€:+focus+groups+exploring+liaison+psychiatry+staff's+perception+about+working+during+the+first+wave+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+Birmingham+and+Solihull+Mental+Health+Foundation+Trust","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S329-S329, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26535,""
"An audit during COVID-19: monitoring of CMHT-patient contact and physical health assessments in a rural Welsh setting","Aims The enforcement of lockdowns and restrictions on non-essential contact have changed Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) practice. Therefore, this audit carried out its 4th cycle of physical health monitoring for patients on antipsychotics with severe mental illness (SMI) under the CMHT during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to observe its impact on physical health monitoring. In addition, with the increased use of telepsychiatry substituting routine face-to-face appointments during the pandemic, this audit also reviews the effect of lockdown on maintenance of contact between CMHT and people with SMI. Primary Objective: to compare the current clinical practice with the standards derived from NICE guidelines which include parameters like weight, body-mass index, blood pressure, ECG and blood tests, then compare with the previous three audit cycles, which collected identical data. Secondary Objective: to monitor amount of contact between healthcare staff and people with SMI on antipsychotics during the three months of Welsh lockdown and compare current clinical practice with the clinical practice achieved in the identical period in 2019. Method Method for Primary Objective: Clinical practice on physical health checks were split into 10 standards derived from the NICE guidelines (NICEQS80, Quality Standard 6). Data collection surrounding physical health checks of patients on antipsychotics from 26th June 2019 to 26th June 2020 were collected and compared with the previous three audit cycles, which collected identical data. Method for Secondary Objective: Retrospective data surrounding amount and type of contact between CMHT and people with SMI was collected from 26th March 2020 to 26th June 2020, a period of enforced lockdown in Wales, and compared with the identical period in 2019. Result The audit iterates trends over the last 4 cycles (2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2019/2020). The current audit cycle increased in 2/10 standards and decreased in 8/10 standards, compared with the average compliance in the 3 previous audit cycles. Out of the 10 derived standards, certain standards fared worse than others. There was a 79% increase in the number of staff-patient contact during the lockdown period. The majority of the contact in 2019 was face-to-face (84.31%), however, as expected, in 2020 the majority of the contact was non face-to-face (61.75%).

"Developing a dashboard for use in a forensic and intensive care psychiatric unit: a quality improvement project","Aims Dashboards provide a visual summary of relevant data to track performance against key indicators over time. They are used in healthcare to monitor the quality of patient care and to identify potential quality improvement projects. There is little published evidence of them being used in mental health services, especially in forensic psychiatric care. This project aims to design a dashboard for use in a forensic and intensive psychiatric care unit, by specifying measures and ideal features it would include. To develop a model for a quality dashboard for use To decide which measures would be reported on the dashboard To find reliable methods of assessing said measures To explore staff preferences as to how the dashboard would display data, and how they would like the information to be disseminated To use blank data to design a mock dashboard interface for feedback Method A literature search was conducted on healthcare dashboards and quality improvement projects taking place on low-secure psychiatric wards similar to the Blair unit. Potential outcome measures and methods of assessing them were researched. Staff thoughts on the dashboard, and which measures they would like to see included, were explored in interviews and using a survey Result Blank data were fed into excel to create example graphs for a mock dashboard. The results section details: measures to be included, such as staff turnover rate, absences, and patient satisfaction levels;how they can be assessed;and specific features of the dashboard, such as the capability to track trends in selected quality indicators over a period of time. Further development of this project out with the 4 week development timeframe will require cooperation from IT services and unit management staff. Conclusion Many staff suggestions, whilst valuable measures, were more suitable for use in a clinical or nursing dashboard, rather than a quality dashboard. COVID-19 factored into reasons why staff requested certain measures, and also meant that less staff were available to be contacted about the project. This project has limitations based on the four-week timeframe, but could be further developed by staff on the unit if desired.","Jamieson, Keara, Bennett, Daniel","https://www.google.com/search?q=Developing+a+dashboard+for+use+in+a+forensic+and+intensive+care+psychiatric+unit:+a+quality+improvement+project","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S196-S196, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26537,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers in different regions of the world","Aims The global health system is facing a serious challenge after the recent outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus infection which was first identified in Wuhan, China in November 2019 and declared as a pandemic in March 2020 by WHO. There is a wide consensus that this pandemic has negative psychosocial consequences as well as unforeseeable provision of mental health care services and just not on physical health alone. The aim of this research study is to determine the prevalence of psychological distress and to identify the sociodemographic variables with the main attributable factors associated with the psychological distress among healthcare workers and suggestions on how to reduce the impact on the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions of the world. Method We performed a cross-sectional study from September-November 2020. We used a self-administered survey tool which was distributed electronically to healthcare workers across the globe. The data were stored on an online database with password protected devices where survey responses were restricted to investigators exclusively. Data collected were: 1) Socio-demographic data (age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, religion, role in the healthcare, region of practice);2) Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) questionnaire which contains 22 standardized items. This is a subjective assessment to score the degree of psychological well-being by focusing on 6 domains: depression;anxiety;positive-well-being;self-control;vitality and general health;3) Subjective assessment from respondents of the main attributable factors causing psychological distress and suggested methods to help reduce the impact on mental health on health care workers. Result Majority out of the 217 respondents were from a younger age group;females and married/domestic partnership, mainly from Western Pacific Region, South East Asian and the African Region. More than half the respondents were moderate-severely psychologically distressed and the three main attributable factors causing psychological distress were: fear of family/friends contracting COVID-19 followed by lack of PPE and discomfort caused by wearing PPE for long hours. Respondents suggested that the distress would be reduced if: more resources were provided in hospital;protocols and guidelines were implemented and counselling facilities with recreational activities were available to frontline workers. Conclusion This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of healthcare workers and more support or strategies need to come in place to protect frontline workers at the time of crises.","Islam, Mahfuja, George, Philip, Sankaran, Sindhu, Su Hui, Janet Leu, Kit, Tzun","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+the+mental+health+of+healthcare+workers+in+different+regions+of+the+world","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S258-S259, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26538,""
"Psychiatric presentations of patients with COVID-19: a retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients seen by liaison psychiatry services","Aims Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with higher rates of psychiatric morbidity due to various factors, including quarantine, social isolation, stigma, financial difficulties and direct and indirect central nervous system impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). This study aimed to describe the psychiatric morbidity of patients with COVID-19 referred to liaison psychiatry services in Qatar. Method This study was a retrospective review of patient records of the first 100 consecutive SARS-Cov-2 positive patients referred to liaison psychiatry services. The study was approved by the Hamad Medical Corporation Institutional Review Board (IRB) (MRC-05â€“072). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Result The majority (n = 92) of 100 included patients were male and median age was 43 years. Patients were of diverse background with majority of South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, Nepalese, and Afghan) (n = 60), followed by Qatari (n = 18) background. Mean length of hospital stay was 26.51 days. 35 patients had severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia, and 67 had at least one underlying physical comorbidity. Significant psychosocial stressors other than positive SARS-Cov-2 status, including lockdown, quarantine, finances and relationships issues were identified in 48 patients. A total of 35 patients had a positive past psychiatric history, out of which 17 were on maintenance psychotropic medications. Insomnia was the commonest psychiatric symptom (n = 65), followed by anxiety (n = 52), agitation (n = 42), depression (n = 39), changes in appetite (n = 32) and irritability (n = 30). The principal psychiatric diagnoses made were delirium (n = 29), acute stress reaction or adjustment disorder (n = 25), depression (n = 16), mania (n = 15), anxiety (n = 14), non-affective psychosis (n = 13), and dementia (n = 6). Approximately half of the patients with mania or non-affective psychosis had it as their first-onset disorder. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, is associated with a wide range of psychiatric morbidity which emphasizes cliniciansâ€™ vigilance for psychiatric symptoms. Insomnia was the commonest neuropsychiatric symptom which may have clinical practice and potential preventive strategies implications. Delirium, the commonest diagnosis in the study carries high morbidity and mortality and may reflect SARS-Cov-2 propensity to affect the brain directly and indirectly through a cytokine storm, organ failure, and prothrombotic state. Patients can also present with new-onset mania or non-affective psychosis. It is noteworthy that about two-thirds of the patients had no past psychiatric history. This study, along with expanding body of evidence may assist with resource allocation and liaison psychiatry services planning. It also underscores the importance of designing future studies to better understand longer-term psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19.","Iqbal, Yousaf, Haddad, Peter, Latoo, Javed, Alabdulla, Majid, Albrahim, Sultan, Kumar, Rajeev, Wadoo, Ovais","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychiatric+presentations+of+patients+with+COVID-19:+a+retrospective+review+of+100+consecutive+patients+seen+by+liaison+psychiatry+services","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S257-S258, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26539,""
"Improving attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine in forensic mental health workers: a quality improvement project","Aims The primary aim of the project was to improve attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine in forensic mental health staff at a large regional tertiary forensic psychiatry unit. The main variable examined was attitudes towards safety of the vaccine. Secondary aims included decreasing misinformation about the vaccine and improving vaccine uptake. Method Paper questionnaires were distributed to willing staff members across 6 forensic inpatient wards within the North London Forensic Service. Participants included a range of allied health professionals including nurses, health care assistants, ward managers, occupational therapists, assistant therapists and administrative staff. Questionnaires used a mixture of Likert scale for agreement/disagreement with statements and yes/no questions. Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology was utilised in implementing changes, and repeat questionnaires used to measure changes in attitude and behaviour. Change ideas implemented included the creation of â€˜mythbustersâ€™ posters which target vaccine misinformation, the creation and distribution of posters of staff members who had already taken their vaccine, the creation of vaccine champions to aid engagement in conversation about the vaccine, vaccine information packs being distributed to all wards and the opportunity for staff to â€˜drop-inâ€™ to clinics for information about the vaccine. Result Vaccine uptake improved from 7% before interventions to 69% after interventions. The proportion of people very unlikely or unlikely to get the vaccine reduced from 25% to just 9%. The proportion of those feeling neutral reduced from 32% to 6%. The proportion of those either likely or very likely to get the vaccine increased from 34% to 85%. Before interventions only 20% felt that the vaccine was either safe or very safe. This improved to 63% after interventions Before interventions, only 27% of respondents felt they had received enough information by the trust to make an informed decision. After interventions, 80% said they had received enough information. The project was successful in reducing misinformation in every domain. Particularly reassuring was the reduction to zero of some of the most harmful misinformation claims, such as the presence of a tracking chip in the vaccine and the belief that COVID does not exist. 71% of respondents indicated the interventions we set out changed their view on the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion The changes implemented lead to clear improvements in all domains measured, suggesting targeted information is an effective strategy in improving uptake and attitudes around the vaccination program.","Howarth, Harrison, Stevens, Toby, Gostick, Benjamin, Stock, Lisanne, Stone, David","https://www.google.com/search?q=Improving+attitudes+towards+the+COVID-19+vaccine+in+forensic+mental+health+workers:+a+quality+improvement+project","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S194-S194, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26540,""
"Person centred approaches to learning hold a potential for a mature depth of understanding and engagement as opposed to the traditional 'transmission of knowledge' approach to learning","Aims Do students experience a person-centred experiential (PCE) approach to learning in a university context differently to transmitted knowledge learning from prior education, and if so, how? Background The person-centred approach, as defined and developed by Carl Ransom Rogers, remains on the margins of practice in the UK. The approach sustains a non-medical stance. All of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Person Centred Experiential Counselling (APT PCEC) workforce require a qualification in person-centred experiential counselling. In order to attune to Roger's hypothesis regarding the conditions required in order to facilitate psychological growth, person-centred learning is a principle stance. Researching experiences of PCE learning through anonymous feedback from students attending different levels of training (BA, MA and post qualification PCE-Counselling for Depress (CfD) License) is an initial test of the hypothesis . Counselling education in the UK is increasingly highly standardised and driven by competency frameworks. This work begins to uncover person-centred studentsâ€™ evaluation of undertaking person-centred qualifications. Modules and continuing professional practice were constructed to facilitate a person-centred learning environment wherein the curriculum was designed by students or the experiential aspect of the learning drove the agenda Method The sample was made up of (N = 30) students. 8 students were studying for a Master's degree in person-centred experiential psychotherapy, 10 students were studying a BA in humanistic psychotherapy, 12 students were attending a mandatory IAPT Continuous Professional Development (CPD) training in PCE therapy. The evaluation responses were subject to a thematic analysis. Result The emerging themes parallel each other and indicate that degree students were very aware of the difference from their previous learning experience in education. 68% of MA Students experienced psychological maturation through the process of training. 83% of BA students became more agentic in their approach to learning. 83% IAPT therapists noticed the nurturing, compassion and humane approach to the learning, despite the mandatory nature of the offer and empowered them in regards to their non-medical stance within an NHS context. Conclusion Our findings point to the significance and impact of person-centred learning for person-centred psychotherapistsâ€™ development during and post-qualification. Implications can be drawn in regards to engaging with person-centred learning in public sector and health contexts. Person centred approaches to learning hold a potential for a mature depth of understanding and engagement as opposed to the traditional â€˜transmission of knowledgeâ€™ approach to learning.","Hayes, Catherine, Heald, Adrian","https://www.google.com/search?q=Person+centred+approaches+to+learning+hold+a+potential+for+a+mature+depth+of+understanding+and+engagement+as+opposed+to+the+traditional+'transmission+of+knowledge'+approach+to+learning","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S254-S254, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26541,""
"Supporting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: implementation of an e-guide","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to activities of daily living, which in turn has had a profound impact on the mental wellbeing of the public. An e-guide was designed to provide remote support to the general public through the application of a Behavioural Activation approach. Interactive, brief evidence-based exercises were included in the e-guide, along with mood ratings after each exercise to assess any improvements observed. Method The e-guide was designed using the Xerte On- Line Toolkits open source software. Videos and interactive exercises were embedded within the resource, forming part of the brief intervention based on cognitivist and behaviourist principles. Information and further support was also provided for young people and parents. Videos from the public highlighting their experiences during the pandemic were also sourced and included (with consent). A pilot was launched to assess the impact of the e-guide. Participants were recruited from Cardiff University, mental health services and a local charity. Result The e-guide was piloted on a sample of volunteers (n = 3), who completed a brief survey after engaging with the resource. Following the results of the pilot, the e-guide was promoted by the university's marketing team and made available to the public. At the 6-month mark, the e-guide had been accessed by 3228 individuals throughout the UK. Conclusion The e-guide has since been disseminated by support services for young people, places of employment and eduction institutions. The national impact of the e-guide is evidenced from the number of people accessing the resource exceeding 3000. With the long-term effects of the pandemic taking hold, it remains crucial to support the wellbeing of the general public through such initiatives that are administered remotely","Hassoulas, Athanasios, Panayiotou, Eliana, Mukhopadhyay, Srinjay, Baskaran, Ravanth, Zhang, Nan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Supporting+mental+health+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+implementation+of+an+e-guide","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S192-S192, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26542,""
"The psychiatry virtual-on-call experience: Can it improve confidence of foundation and GP trainees with out-of-hours work in psychiatry?","Aims Out-of-hours (â€˜on-callâ€™) work can be perceived by junior doctors to be a daunting experience, associated with feeling unprepared and less supported. Simulated on-call programmes have been used to great effect in medicine and surgery to improve junior doctorsâ€™ skills in task prioritisation, interpersonal communication and confidence on-call. However, few psychiatry-specific programmes exist. We aimed to: i) Develop a psychiatry specific virtual-on-call programme, ii) Investigate if the virtual-on-call programme improved confidence amongst junior trainees in key areas of psychiatry practice. Method The Psychiatry Virtual-On-Call programme commenced in December 2020. It involves attending an introductory on-call lecture, followed later in the rotation by a 2-hour simulated on-call shift. All trainees are expected to attend during their attachment and the simulated shifts are ongoing. During the shift, trainees are â€˜bleepedâ€™ with different psychiatry specific tasks. They work through the tasks, using local intranet policies and telephone advice from the on-call psychiatry registrar. Due to COVID-19 the sessions were delivered virtually. Participants completed a questionnaire evaluating confidence in ten domains, rated on a Likert scale from 0â€“10. Questionnaires were completed at four time-points during the programme;pre- and post-introductory lecture and pre- and post-simulated shift. Scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05 with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple testing. Result Twenty-nine trainees attended the introductory lecture, 25 and 21 trainees completed the pre- and post-lecture questionnaire respectively. A non-significant improvement in confidence was reported in three domains: seclusions reviews, prescribing, detention under the mental health act. At the time of writing, ten trainees had attended the on-call shift. All participants completed a pre- and post-session questionnaire. The on-call shift was a useful learning experience (median score 9), and significantly increased perceived preparedness for on-call work from 3/10 to 7/10 (p &lt; 0.001). Confidence was significantly improved in seven domains, most markedly in seclusion reviews, prescribing and mental health act tasks. Conclusion The psychiatry virtual-on-call programme fills a niche in the training curriculum and is perceived by trainees to be a useful learning experience. The introductory lecture improved confidence in several domains, but not as effectively as the on-call shift. The on-call shift was well received by participants and significantly improved confidence in 7/10 domains. In summary, the virtual-on-call experience improves preparedness for out-of-hours psychiatry work. Follow-up of participants at the end of their psychiatry rotation will ascertain if they felt the programme to be useful during out-of-hours work.","Harrison, Charlotte, Blamey, Helen, Roddick, Alistair, Saunders, Kate, Malhotra, Tina","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+psychiatry+virtual-on-call+experience:+Can+it+improve+confidence+of+foundation+and+GP+trainees+with+out-of-hours+work+in+psychiatry?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S28-S29, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26543,""
"Assessing wellbeing in foundation doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has had a drastic effect on the mental health of the global population that is likely to be felt for years to come. One group particuarly likely to be affected by this in the immediate future are the healthcare professionals working on the frontline of the NHS pandemic response. As members of a foundation cohort of these junior doctors we aimed to create a way to quanitfy the wellbeing of ourselves and our colleagues at this challeging time. We aimed to use a combination of numerous tools to monitor foundation doctors in Blackburn during this crisis. This would inform which measures would be best suited to be put in place to protect this cohort from early burnout and poor mental health in the future. Method We designed a survey of 25 questions which we invited our foundation colleagues to fill in anonymously during the first and second waves of the pandemic in response to times when foundation doctors were redeployed to aid the frontline. The survey has been based on the PHQ9, GAD7, Epworth Sleepiness scale, Physician wellbeing index, Medical students wellbeing index, Maslach burnout inventory BMA burnout questionnaire and the QOL scale. Result From a cohort of around 140 foundation doctors we had 46 participants in our trial of this tool;46% had been redeployed and 54% not redeployed. Over 50% of survey respondents reported high stress, poor motivation and depersonalisation over the two weeks at the peak of the pandemic, key early signs of burnout. Lack of interest in their work, poor sleep and anhedonia were increased across both groups (redeployed and non redeployed). The interventions after the first wave data which repondents found beneficial included;financial reassurances during redeployments, protected non clinical areas for rest, a named individual senior staff member for wellbeing support. Conclusion Key issues the survey raised were fed back to foundation programme leads in monthly meetings. This allowed us with our foundation leads to make targeted changes in order to support foundation doctors at this time. Without the data from this tool which we tailored to the foundation experience we believe these rapidly worsening issues during the pandemic would not have been addressed so swiftly. We then resurveyed the foundation cohort to assess which of these interventions have been most widely used and appreciated.","Handa, Nikhita, Pramanik, Sanjeev","https://www.google.com/search?q=Assessing+wellbeing+in+foundation+doctors+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S190-S190, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26544,""
"Item-level analysis of mental health symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: Associations with age, sex and pre-existing psychiatric conditions","Background There is widespread concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health. Emerging meta-analyses suggest that the impact on anxiety/depression may have been transient, but much of the included literature has major methodological limitations. Addressing this topic rigorously requires longitudinal data of sufficient scope and scale, controlling for contextual variables, with baseline data immediately pre-pandemic. Aims To analyse self-report of symptom frequency from two largely UK-based longitudinal cohorts: Cohort 1 (NÂ =Â 10,475, two time-points: winter pre-pandemic to UK first winter resurgence), and Cohort 2 (NÂ =Â 10,391, two time-points, peak first wave to UK first winter resurgence). Method Multinomial logistic regression applied at the item level identified sub-populations with greater probability of change in mental health symptoms. Permutation analyses characterised changes in symptom frequency distributions. Cross group differences in symptom stability were evaluated via entropy of response transitions. Results Anxiety was the most affected aspect of mental health. The profiles of change in mood symptoms was less favourable for females and older adults. Those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses showed substantially higher probability of very frequent symptoms pre-pandemic and elevated risk of transitioning to the highest levels of symptoms during the pandemic. Elevated mental health symptoms were evident across intra-COVID timepoints in Cohort 2. Conclusions These findings suggest that mental health has been negatively affected by the pandemic, including in a sustained fashion beyond the first UK lockdown into the first winter resurgence. Women, and older adults, were more affected relative to their own baselines. Those with diagnoses of psychiatric conditions were more likely to experience transition to the highest levels of symptom frequency.","Hampshire, Adam, Trender, William, Grant, Jon E.; Mirza, M.

"Creating a virtual, clinical scenario based teaching programme for foundation doctors in Leeds","Aims Through consultation with foundation doctors on their psychiatry placements in Leeds, we established that they didn't feel the trustwide teaching programme met their needs, with them rating the relevance as 5.8 on a 1-10 Likert scale. They also reported their access to formal and informal teaching had been limited by COVID-19 restrictions. We aimed to create an accessible teaching programme that met their developmental needs as set out by the Foundation curriculum, as well as their confidence and skill set in dealing with common mental health presentations. Our supplementary aims were to promote psychiatry as a career and to provide supervised teaching opportunities to core trainees. Method Having assessed the foundation doctors confidence in dealing with different scenarios, we created a 9 week teaching programme covering common mental health presentations they're likely to encounter during their training. The virtual sessions focus on what assessment and management skills would be expected for a foundation doctor, as well as when and how to access support and refer on. The programme was designed to be trainee led with the teaching being facilitated by core trainees as it was felt that they would best relate to the experiences and developmental needs of foundation doctors. This also provided the CTs with an opportunity to develop their teaching skills, something that has become more difficult during COVID. Result Through weekly feedback of the sessions we were able to demonstrate that for 8 of the 9 sessions the foundation doctors rated them as being â€˜usefulâ€™ or â€˜very usefulâ€™ and we're currently reviewing the topic and materials for the outlying session. Through self-assessed ratings before and after the programme, we demonstrated significant increases in confidence in dealing with all 9 of the scenarios. All of the foundation doctors indicated that they had found the programme beneficial. Conclusion As shown in the results, the programme has been well received by the foundation doctors who's confidence in dealing with a range of scenarios has improved. The programme has also been well received by the trust who have asked us to repeat the it for future foundation rotations and by core trainees who were grateful of the development opportunities that this provided. Further developments will include extending the programme for the duration of the placement to enable us to cover an enhanced range of presentations and to consolidate core skills.","Hall, David, Lane, Thomas, Harbinson, Alexander","https://www.google.com/search?q=Creating+a+virtual,+clinical+scenario+based+teaching+programme+for+foundation+doctors+in+Leeds","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S138-S139, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26546,""

"Wellbeing support for foundation doctors during COVID-19 in GHNHSFT","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of wellbeing amongst healthcare professionals. Medical professionals, notably junior doctors, are at increased risk of developing poor mental health and burnout. The GMC Barometer Study in 2020 showed that 32% of doctors found the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health. The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess and improve hospital wellbeing support available to foundation doctors within Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (GHNHSFT) by learning and reflecting on the impact of COVID-19. Method After identifying a lack of resources within GHNHSFT, wellbeing information boards were displayed in communal areas and distributed by email. These encompassed trust wide support, practical information including childcare and relaxation resources concentrating on mindfulness, exercise and culture. A survey of foundation doctors was completed to assess doctorsâ€™ focus and approach to wellbeing. Questions assessed influential factors in maintaining wellbeing, access to current hospital resources and future interventions. Result 94% of respondents recognised that their focus on wellbeing increased during COVID-19. One third of foundation doctors found it challenging to maintain their wellbeing, with 40% reporting difficulty accessing hospital support and advice. The most important factors foundation doctors identified in maintaining wellbeing were exercise, cooking and baking, and social networks. Colleagues were a significant source of wellbeing support, followed by notice boards, email resources and social media. Conclusion COVID-19 highlighted the importance and burden on wellbeing of foundation doctors, with a significant number struggling to access support. Future recommendations include the use of a â€˜buddy systemâ€™, regular and accessible exercise classes and improved communication of wellbeing support and resources to staff members. Buddy systems have already shown success amongst teams however it is important these are accessible to all foundation doctors and universally offered within the trust. A weekly yoga class is being reintroduced to be available to all doctors. A particular focus has been the development of a health and wellbeing section to feature in the trusts weekly communications, with the aim to regularly signpost staff to ongoing wellbeing resources and support. Social networking and media were highlighted as important in both maintaining wellbeing and accessing resources. A future goal is to develop an official GHNHSFT Instagram or Twitter account focused on wellbeing. We hope to continue to learn from the impact of COVID-19, improving the availability of wellbeing support at GHNHSFT that will continue into the future.","Graham, Abbi, Dale, Anna-Marie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Wellbeing+support+for+foundation+doctors+during+COVID-19+in+GHNHSFT","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S189-S189, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26548,""
"Vitamin D deficiency in a high secure forensic psychiatry hospital: A clinical audit and service evaluation","Aims To assess concordance with guidelines on monitoring vitamin D levels and prescribing prophylaxis or replacement. To assess the association between the implementation of local guidelines and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Background Vitamin D deficiency is associated with various adverse health outcomes including osteoporosis, fractures and myalgia. Most recently, vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesised as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include incarceration, ethnicity, diet and a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. Vitamin D deficiency is known to be prevalent among individuals within forensic mental health institutions. Local Trust guidelines advise that vitamin D levels should be checked within one-month of hospital admission, followed by checks at three-monthly intervals. Recommendations for prescribing depend on patientsâ€™ vitamin D levels;deficient (&lt;25nmol/L), insufficient (25 &lt; 50nmol/L) or adequate (50-150nmol/L). We assessed concordance with these guidelines at Broadmoor Hospital, UK. Method Medical records, laboratory results and drug charts were assessed for a total of 75 patients across 15 wards. Data were collected using a standardised audit tool, including;date of admission, admission vitamin D level, most recent vitamin D level and the dose and frequency of vitamin D prescribed. Result 76.4% of patients had their vitamin D levels checked within one month of admission. 66.7% of patients had their vitamin D checked within the last 3 months. For patients with an admission vitamin D level recorded, 43.6% had deficient vitamin D levels, 43.6% had insufficient levels and 12.7% had adequate levels. For patients with a more recent serum vitamin D level, 14.5% had deficient levels, 38.7% had insufficient levels and 46.8% had adequate levels. For patients with a documented serum vitamin D level, 21.4% were prescribed the correct dose, 22.9% were under-dosed, 14.3% were over-dosed and 41.4% received no dose where guidelines suggested they should. Conclusion Comparison of admission and most recent vitamin D levels suggests a general improvement in prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with the implementation of local guidelines. However, we identify significant areas for improvement. A substantial proportion of patients lacked admission or regular monitoring of vitamin D levels and a substantial proportion of patients were under-dosed or received no dose where guidelines suggested they should have. We propose that better concordance with guidelines may improve clinical outcomes further. This may prove especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, given a potential association between vitamin D deficiency and severity of respiratory infection.","Gillett, George, Chudleigh-Warren, Samantha, Hardy, Benedict, Gordon, Charles Robert","https://www.google.com/search?q=Vitamin+D+deficiency+in+a+high+secure+forensic+psychiatry+hospital:+A+clinical+audit+and+service+evaluation","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S26-S26, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26549,""
"Evaluating virtual role play based learning to improve the confidence and competence of Junior Doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient Psychiatry","Aims To enable junior doctors to practice their clinical skills in managing psychiatric emergencies via virtual role plays, and to gain confidence and competence in their skills in acute psychiatry. Lecture based learning about psychiatric emergencies is a part of the induction programme for all junior doctors starting their placements however practical learning and practice of skills in this area is not. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue by providing an additional challenge to the delivery of face to face teaching for junior doctors both in clinical and educational settings. Method The author offered a virtual role play based teaching session to two cohorts of Junior Doctors (GP trainees and foundation trainees) who were starting their psychiatric hospital placements at Surrey and Borders Partnership. The virtual sessions were conducted over Microsoft teams. This session had been run once before as face to face teaching (F2F) in January 2019 (N = 9) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this session were compared to data obtained from the virtual sessions in November 2020 and January 2021 (N = 16). Pre and post study questionnaires were administered via Microsoft Forms. Each session lasted 1 hour and consisted of 3 different role play scenarios based around acute psychiatric emergencies. One junior doctor volunteer acted as the â€˜patientâ€™ in each scenario and another volunteer as the â€˜doctorâ€™. The other participants all acted as observers. Each scenario lasted 10 minutes with ten minutes for feedback from the researcher afterwards using the ALOBA framework. Categorical, ordinal data were collected using a Likert scale and general qualitative feedback was also gathered. Result The questionnaire return rate was 100% for F2F teaching and 57% for virtual teaching. 100% of participants felt that F2F role play was an acceptable way to practice skills in acute psychiatry vs 75% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. 100% of participants found that F2F role play was â€˜quiteâ€™ or â€˜veryâ€™ effective in improving their confidence and perceived competence in acute psychiatry vs 88% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. Conclusion Virtual role play based learning is an acceptable and effective method in improving the confidence and perceived competence of junior doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient psychiatry but it appears to be less effective than face to face role play based learning. The researcher will act upon the qualitative feedback obtained which suggested ways in which the virtual session could be improved.","Gardner, Katherine","https://www.google.com/search?q=Evaluating+virtual+role+play+based+learning+to+improve+the+confidence+and+competence+of+Junior+Doctors+undertaking+on+call+shifts+in+inpatient+Psychiatry","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S137-S137, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26550,""
"Has the COVID-19 pandemic affected out-of-hours presentations in CAMHS?","Aims The aim of this project was to look at whether the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically lockdown, has impacted out-of-hours presentations to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in North Central and East London. Method Specialist Registrars (SpRs) on the Royal London/Great Ormond Street CAMHS Higher Training Scheme are contacted for advice regarding all CAMHS presentations in the North Central and East London area. Responsibilities includes provision of advice to 6 hospitals (including 4 emergency departments) and 4 child and adolescent inpatient units. A record of all phone calls and call-outs, including Mental Health Act and Section 136 (S136) assessments are maintained and this study compares pre- and post-COVID-19 data to see if there are any differences in number of presentations, on-site assessments (including Mental Health Act and S136 assessments over 2019 and 2020. Result Numbers of CAMHS presentations were lower in 2020 (mean 74 patients per month) compared with 2019 (60 patients per month). This was consistent across all months except October and December. The largest difference was seen in March: 109 patients presented in March 2019, compared with 55 in March 2020. This is also reflected in the number of assessments conducted on site. However, there do not appear to be differences in the numbers of Mental Health Act or S136 assessments undertaken over 2020, compared with 2019. Conclusion CAMHS out-of-hours presentations dropped off significantly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and in particular, with the first lockdown (March to July 2020). Specialist Registrars provided advice via telephone less frequently in 2020 compared with 2019, and were required to do fewer on-site assessments of children and young people presenting with mental health difficulties. There were no significant differences in Mental Health Act or S136 assessments between the two years, however, these numbers are too small to make any meaningful conclusions. It is likely that children and adolescents were less likely to present to emergency departments for assessment of their mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than this reflecting a true reduction in mental health difficulties. Recommendations: It is helpful to continue to monitor CAMHS out-of-hour presentations. Trusts may want to consider alternative settings for providing emergency CAMHS assessments, for example, mental health hubs. Limitations: This provision of data is subject to recall bias.","Evans, Sacha","https://www.google.com/search?q=Has+the+COVID-19+pandemic+affected+out-of-hours+presentations+in+CAMHS?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S321-S321, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26551,""
"To resuscitate or not to resuscitate;a question for old age psychiatrists","Aims The inpatient population of an older adult psychiatric ward will include people with physical and mental health conditions which affect life span and quality of life. Patients may be frail, acutely unwell, or have terminal illnesses such as dementia. It is therefore essential that clinicians review resuscitation status as part of their routine practice. However, we are aware that advanced decision-making â€“ to resuscitate or not to resuscitate â€“ is not routine practice across older adult psychiatric wards in the UK. Our 2017 audit reflected this, demonstrating a very low rate of resuscitation decisions at NELFT. This re-audit aimed to measure the frequency and quality of resuscitation decisions on an older adult psychiatric ward. We expected improvements in these areas, subsequent to changes implemented from the initial audit. We also sought to identify which patient factors influenced cliniciansâ€™ decision-making on resuscitation. Please note, this audit was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method In June 2017, an audit of 25 patients admitted to two older adult psychiatric acute wards was completed. In December 2019, a retrospective analysis of the last 25 admissions to one older adult ward was undertaken. Electronic patient notes and DNACPR (Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) orders were examined. The audit measured frequency of resuscitation decisions and quality of documentation against current standards. DNACPR orders were analysed and clinicians were interviewed to identify the reasons for such decisions. Result There was an increase in the number of patients for which resuscitation decisions were made, from 4% in 2017 to 40% (n = 10) in 2019. The majority of patients with a DNACPR decision (n = 8) had a diagnosis of dementia. Prospective quality of life, with this diagnosis, was the most frequent determinant of DNACPR decisions (n = 7). Qualitative analysis indicated that clinicians were more likely to consider a resuscitation decision for patients with an organic disorder rather than functional disorder. Adequate completion of DNACPR orders was seen in each case. Either the patient, a family member or carer was involved in every decision. The standard for recording decisions on the electronic patient record was not met. Conclusion It is good practice to consider resuscitation decisions for patients admitted to older adult psychiatric wards. This re-audit found an improvement in frequency of resuscitation decisions and also revealed differences in decision-making for patients with organic and functional disorders. Implementation of further change is indicated;decision-making can be improved through reflection, teaching, changes to practice, and technologies.","Embliss, Liam, Bhat, Mohan","https://www.google.com/search?q=To+resuscitate+or+not+to+resuscitate;a+question+for+old+age+psychiatrists","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S21-S22, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26552,""
"Anxiety levels among health care workers within Irish mental health services during COVID-19: a survey","Aims The aim of this survey was to assess any fluctuations in anxiety levels experienced by mental health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association between these changes and variables of information dissemination, risk management, and managerial support. Method A survey was created to assess variables of information dissemination, risk management, and managerial support. The GAD-7 was employed as measure for anxiety during and pre the pandemic The survey was conducted online via an anonymised questionnaire and disseminated by management through the heads of various disciplines within the mental health work force, using the local email portal in the Cork region. It was made available for research participation for a period of one month(JULY). Following this stage, the reported data were analysed utilizing paired samples t-test, Pearson's correlations, and a hierarchical regression. Demographic variables were controlled for during analysis. Result 102 mental health healthcare workers participated in the survey (81.2% Female, 18.8% Male). The mean GAD-7 total scores for Pre-COVID-19 doubled in the during COVID-19 condition. The largest effect can be seen on the GAD-7 facet of â€œfeeling afraid as if something awful might happenâ€ with pre-COVID-19 GAD-7 mean scores more than quadrupling during COVID-19 conditions. Managerial support had a moderate negative relationship with GAD-7 scores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information dissemination total scores also had a moderate positive correlation with managerial support total scores and perceived risk/safety total scores. There was no correlation found between the GAD-7 total scores during COVID-19 pandemic and Information dissemination total scores nor Risk/safety total scores. Childcare was a concern for 64% of staff that it was applicable to;45% of these staff considered altering work hours;17% reported issues from management regarding these requests. Conclusion Mental health workers have seen a dramatic increase in anxiety since the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the context of expecting something bad to happen. Managerial support appears to be a protective factor for increased anxiety levels in this population. Childcare has been a predominant concern and altering working hours to accommodate this has been problematic for almost 1 in 5 mental health workers. Staff satisfaction with information dissemination positively affects perceived managerial support and perceived risk management. This study is limited by the utilization of a novel self-created measure for examining variables specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the employment of a retrospective measure to obtain baseline anxiety scores of staff members before the pandemic.","Elimam, Ibrahim, McCarthy, Mary, Cooney, Roisin, Dumitrescu, Alin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety+levels+among+health+care+workers+within+Irish+mental+health+services+during+COVID-19:+a+survey","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S247-S247, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26553,""
"The Safety Conversation: developing a trustwide safety conference at CNWL during a pandemic","Aims The COVID pandemic has had both a massive impact on clinical service delivery and the way that training and education is provided. CNWL is a large NHS provider and has approximately 7000 staff working across 150 locations, providing mental health and community health services. In response to the need to share learning across the organisation, a trustwide â€œSafety Conversation Dayâ€ took place to spotlight the work being done to promote safety and to act as a platform to share ideas and learning across the trust. This was the first ever virtual conference organised by the trust. Method The one-day conference included virtual posters and an all-day open access virtual conversation delivered via zoom. The day was divided into 6 safety themes: Safety tools;Safer Environments;Supporting and Involving Staff;Safer use of Medicines;See Think Act and Relational Security;and Prevention is Better than Cure. Frontline staff delivered 5-6 short presentations each hour highlighting new ways of working, quality improvement, local research etc. Staff were also encouraged to submit posters for the event, with webinars held on how to write a poster held prior to the safety conversation to promote engagement. Prizes were awarded for best posters in the different categories. A mentimeter survey was running throughout the day to get feedback from participants. Result This was the largest event of this kind held by the trust. 430 unique viewers logged in during the day to watch the presentations. Feedback was very positive on the mentimeter survey. 3 questions were asked on a likert scale of: Strongly Disagree â€“ Strongly Agree (rated out of 5): â€˜I found the posters really useful': 4.5/5 â€˜I found the presentations very useful': 4.6/5 â€˜I will share what I've learnt about safety': 4.6/5Open space questions and word cloud responses also highlighted qualitative feedback with most frequent responses including â€˜inspiring', â€˜interesting and â€˜stimulatingâ€™. 174 posters were presented with good representation from all services and staff groups across the trust (18 on safer use of medicines, 15 on co-production, 52 on quality improvement, 50 on COVID and non-COVID safety, 16 on use of technology, 23 on supporting and involving staff). These posters have since been downloaded 4062 times. Conclusion The first CNWL safety conference proved an excellent opportunity to celebrate achievements in patient safety in a very difficult year. It was very well-received and well-attended by staff, promoting maximal learning across the organisation.","Duncan, Emily, Edwards, Simon, Butler, Alison, Kelly, Cornelius","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Safety+Conversation:+developing+a+trustwide+safety+conference+at+CNWL+during+a+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S133-S134, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26554,""
"Service user experience of remote consultations during COVID-19 in an older adult community mental health setting","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on our ability to communicate face-to-face with patients freely. Similar to other medical specialities and general practice (1), to continue providing a service for our service users, we employed other means of communication including telephone and video consultations (although face-to-face consultations were available for high clinical concern and/or identified risk). We set out to explore the acceptability of remote consultation for service users of an older adult (&gt;65 years) Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). Reference: BMJ 2020;371:m3945 Method A total of 34 service users were selected randomly from the CMHT caseload (9% of total 372 caseload). 4 clinicians were involved in collecting data between July and October 2020. We used our trust's (East London Foundation Trust) standard questionnaire on patient satisfaction and contacted individuals by telephone to complete the survey. Result For both questions of â€˜I felt listened to by the teamâ€™ and â€˜I feel I have been given enough information regarding my careâ€™ 17 (50%) responders â€˜agreedâ€™ with this statement and an additional 13 (38%) â€˜strongly agreedâ€™ (total of 88%). For the statement â€˜I feel involved in decisions about my careâ€™ 16 (47%) responders â€˜agreedâ€™ and a further 11 (32%) responders â€˜strongly agreedâ€™ with this statement. The statement â€˜The professionals involved in my care talk to each other and we all work as a teamâ€™ had 15 (44%) responders â€˜agreeâ€™ and 13 (38%) responders â€˜strongly agreeâ€™. When asked â€˜If you experienced telephone/video sessions, were these helpful?â€™ 31 responders said â€˜yesâ€™. Conclusion Overall most responders agreed or strongly agreed that they felt listened to, were given enough information about their care, felt involved in decisions about their care and that they worked as a team with the professionals involved in their care. 91% of responders felt that the video/telephone sessions had been helpful. These data have provided reassurance that telemedicine methods were a useful substitute for face-to-face consultations during the early stages of the pandemic. However this was a small scale study. This study cannot tell us about the experience after the initial 6 months of the pandemic, how often it would be optimal for people have face to face reviews, or whether satisfaction with telemedicine altered over a longer period. We were also not able to tell whether the experience varied for those who had less robust and longstanding relationships with their clinicians.","Dineva, Darena, Altun, Sukran, Twaha, Tahiya, Brown, Juliette","https://www.google.com/search?q=Service+user+experience+of+remote+consultations+during+COVID-19+in+an+older+adult+community+mental+health+setting","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S20-S20, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26555,""
"Adherence to Public Health England (PHE) guidance for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in north Wales mental health unit- a regional audit","Aims To ensure that the PPE guidance is strictly adhered to. To ensure that patient care is not compromised. To help us in areas of need in order to educate the staff regarding the techniques of PPE and thus ensure patient and staff safety and care during the pandemic. Method Novel coronavirus 2019 was first described in December 2019 in Wuhan in China. Since those initial few cases, it has rapidly proliferated to a global pandemic, putting an inordinate amount of strain on healthcare systems around the world. We believe that the technique of donning and doffing if followed as per PHE guidelines would be of help in both preventing the infection and improve the care and safety of both patients and staff. This Audit includes both In-patient and Out-patient units in Psychiatric services across North Wales. Data were collected from 19 units out of 39. We observed covertly 325 staff members belonging to various cadres. Apart from the Donning and Doffing techniques, we also observed the availability of designated areas for this purpose and the availability of PPE as well. Data collection was by junior and senior doctors from various sites of the mental health unit in North Wales. A proforma was provided, the standards were based on PHE guidelines. Result It was noted that just about 50% of the staff followed donning as per guidance. Amongst all three sites, the Central team showed a better adherence with 85% of them donning PPE correctly. whereas only 22% adhered to donning in the West team. Only 21% of them managed to doff PPE as per guidance amongst all 3 centres in North Wales. It was also noted that there are no designated areas to Don and Doff in outpatient units. Staff, in general, seem to not adhere to the guidance of utilising a mask, especially when within 2 meters distance of other staff. Conclusion We will be presenting the Audit at the regional meeting. After discussion with the infection prevention control team and Health and safety lead, we intend to improvise the wards with designated areas for donning and doffing. Teaching sessions for the staff in all three sites, reminders in various areas of the community mental health units and inpatient units. We are hoping that these recommendations will help us in achieving our aim of health and safety during this pandemic.","Dhandapani, Asha, Soundararajan, Sathyan, Salmoiraghi, Alberto, Ginty, Shona, Mitu, Tajnin, Akinlua, Justina, Thomas, Catrin, Malhotra, Rahul, Azhar, Zeenish, Bhutta, Haseeb, Taib, Hanani, Shankar, Nikhil Gauri, Bhangu, Vikram, Kamau, Gathoni, Chamberlain, Elizabeth, Mackenzie, Anna, Pahlen, Henrik, Lock, Hannah, Rymansaib, Aniis, McLean, Pauline, Trujillo, Rodrigo, Simiyon, Manjula, Chappell, Adam, Gross, Agnieszka, Gaskell, Gaynor","https://www.google.com/search?q=Adherence+to+Public+Health+England+(PHE)+guidance+for+the+use+of+personal+protective+equipment+(PPE)+in+north+Wales+mental+health+unit-+a+regional+audit","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S318-S318, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26556,""
"Episode of Dual Neural Genetic Firefly (DNGF) Transmission Key Generation in New Normal Mode of COVID-19 SecondÂ Wave Telepsychiatry","The volume of E-commerce transactions had accelerated on huge scale due to COVID-19. Telemedicine comes under the segment of E-commerce, where the patients can get their treatments from isolates. Patientsâ€™ information security is a basic challenge in this COVID-19 telemedicine segment. The majority of the non-obtrusive and non-emergency patients are encouraged and treated distantly from their secludes without the inclusion of COVID-19 transmission. Anxiety, depressive disorders, stress, dementia, mood disorder, OCD, aggression, etc. are the critical mental challenges that have abruptly occurred during this COVID period. The present workÂ focused on â€œNew Normal Modeâ€ of COVID-19 telepsychiatry so that the patientsâ€™ mental illness can be treated remotely in a secure way. An episode of dual neural-genetic firefly (DNGF) has been proposed on COVID-19 ""New Normal Mode"" 2nd wave telepsychiatry. The pool of transmission keys was generated with the help of firefly algorithm, neural perceptron, and genetic operations. Besides these, the proposed DNGF keys are effective to be used for different online psychiatric transactions. The objectivity of this paper is to generate a robust pool of transmission keys in order to nullify different types of intruding. It has effectively cleared Avalanche test and Strict Avalanche test.

"Impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric services and presentations in north-west Edinburgh","Aims COVID-19 has had a significant impact on healthcare provision, accessibility and psychiatric presentations. We aim to investigate the impact of the pandemic on psychiatric services and the severity of presentations in Edinburgh, with a particular focus on the North-West Edinburgh Community Mental Health Team (NW CMHT). Method Measures of the impact of the pandemic on NW CMHT were identified as referral numbers from primary care and Did Not Attend (DNA) rates. Royal Edinburgh Hospital admissions, detentions under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (MHA) and Out of Hours (OOH) contacts were used as proxy measures to explore the severity and urgency of presentations. Quantitative data focussing on these parameters for patients aged 18â€“65 years in NW CMHT in 2019 and 2020 were collected from NHS Lothian Analytical Services. OOH data were only available Edinburgh-wide. All data were anonymised in line with NHS Lothian Information Governance Policy. In order to assess the impact on staff, a questionnaire was created and disseminated, with qualitative data returned anonymously. Result Referrals to NW CMHT decreased by 9.3% in 2020 (n = 2164) compared to 2019 (n = 2366). Referrals in April (n = 81) and May (n = 102) 2020 were far below the monthly average across the two years (n = 188). Appointment numbers were very similar in 2019 (n = 3542) and 2020 (n = 3514). Despite this, DNA and cancellation rates decreased by 3.94% in 2020. Questionnaire results illustrated some of the challenges for staff of working during a pandemic. Admissions to hospital reduced by 6.8% in 2020 (n = 219 vs n = 235). While MHA detentions in NW Edinburgh increased by only 1.8% (n = 173 vs n = 170), new Compulsory Treatment Orders (CTO) increased by 60%. Furthermore, OOH contacts across Edinburgh increased by 45.2% when compared to 2019. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic altered the way patients accessed healthcare. Uncertainty of the public in accessing primary care services early in the pandemic may have contributed to reduced referral numbers. The increase in CTOs is suggestive of severe relapses in previously stable patients or new episodes of illness. The pandemic may have contributed to a reduction in early recognition, and referral, of those with major mental disorders resulting in more protracted or severe illness episodes. The increase in OOH crisis contacts supports such a hypothesis. Despite what would be expected, DNA and cancellation rates in NW CMHT reduced. The contribution of telemedicine to this warrants further exploration as a means of delivering healthcare in an efficient and accessible way.","Devadas, Ritika, Murdie, Douglas, Thomas, Idris, Hannah, Rhona, Karbowniczek, Wiktoria, Kinney, Tara, Lacey-Solymar, Oscar, Lukaszuk, Adam, MacDonald, Seona, McIntosh, Sarah, Taha, Danya, Taylor, Charles","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+psychiatric+services+and+presentations+in+north-west+Edinburgh","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S74-S75, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26558,""
"Audit on structure of assessment for remote consultation during COVID-19 pandemic","Aims According to the Royal College of Psychiatry, GMC guidelines and NHS England, it is necessary to consider remote consultation to enable service delivery to those requiring shielding or facing additional health risk, and to avoid transition of infection. To audit whether the standards of Mobile and Remote access work are met. To audit whether the standards of Consent to Examination and Treatment are met. To also evaluate whether the remote consultation due to the COVID-19 pandemic is being explicitly documented or not. To suggest to the policy makers the need to establish some standards of practice concerning remote consultation and consent in the COVID-19 pandemic Method Inclusion criteria â€“ sample of service users who had remote consultation in April, May, and mid-June 2020 by doctors of MHSOP community mental health team at Bassetlaw Hospital. Data collection: Retrospective. Data source(s) used: Patient/Client medical/care records Anticipated benefits of this audit: Due to the nature of current COVID-19 pandemic situation, it is essential to minimise contacts with vulnerable groups to prevent transmission of infection. It is anticipated that the number of remote consultations will grow in the forthcoming months. This audit creates an opportunity to develop a new policy and improve the quality of remote consultations documentation. Result Documentation for remote consultation was done in 81% of case notes whereas documentation of consent obtained was present in 57% of patientsâ€™ electronic notes. 90% of entries had documentation of â€˜addressed concernsâ€™. Around 50-70% of patientsâ€™ documents showed good record keeping on domains of â€˜ability to maintain effective communicationâ€™, â€˜mental state examinationâ€™, â€˜risk assessmentâ€™ and â€˜ability to understand medication plus side effectsâ€™. About 40% of documentation met standards for good record keeping on â€˜management planâ€™, â€˜concerns raisedâ€™, â€˜chance given to ask about management planâ€™. Conclusion Most of the standards of good consultations are being met despite the change in the type of Consultation due to COVID-19. However, there are identified areas for improvement which could be focused on. For example, documentation can be clearer when consent is gained for remote consultation. It should not be presumed that, as patients are booked in a certain type of clinic, they have been properly consented beforehand. Key Success: Almost in all domains 40% have met the standards Key Concerns: There are areas where a lot of evidence is partially documented. The above results can be explained as a consequence of a sudden change in the normal working pattern in a community-based setting, having minimal protocols and procedures on standards of working in the situation of COVID19 remote consultation. Following this audit, we aim to increase the amount of information recorded during remote consultation. The plan is to develop a template that would cover the requirements for a remote consultation recommended by national guidelines The proposal of a letter template following a remote consultation will be disseminated to the MHSOP CMHT teams for any suggestions/approval.","Das, Astha, Kuklewicz, Margaret","https://www.google.com/search?q=Audit+on+structure+of+assessment+for+remote+consultation+during+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S73-S73, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26559,""
"An analysis of outcome measures in a specialist inpatient eating disorders unit in Aberdeen: changes since 2015 and response to the COVID-19 lockdown","Aims Identify differences in outcome measures between inpatient cohorts during the first year of the pandemic compared with preceding years. Identify key elements in the treatment provided by identifying any trends in the outcome measures between 2015 and 2021. Background The Eden Unit at the Royal Cornhill Hospital (RCH) in Aberdeen is a ten-bed specialist centre for the inpatient treatment of eating disorders (ED). Strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have meant that important aspects of therapy in the Eden Unit are no longer permissible. It is not known whether handicaps to providing the previous service are reflected in recent outcomes. Method Values for age, length of stay (LOS), BMI, HbA1c (diabetic patients) and responses to three questionnaires: Eating Disorder Evaluation Questionnaire (EDE-Q);Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-21;and Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE). This data were collected for April 2020 to February 2021 (Pandemic) and compared with five preceding years, April 2015 to March 2020 (Pre-COVID). The project was registered with NHS Grampian Quality Assurance Team and approved by the MCN Quality Assurance subgroup. Ethical approval was not required. A data collection sheet allowed anonymised data to be entered into a Microsoft Excel TM Spreadsheet for analysis of baseline demographics. Result Average age of patients remained similar across the six years. Length of stay in the first year of the pandemic was significantly shortened. BMI on discharge in 2020/21 remained similar to preceding years. If relevant, HbA1c was measured throughout admission and comparison with BMI change reflected a focus on treating both diabetes and ED concurrently. Comparison of admission and discharge questionnaires to determine outcome measures proved difficult due to the small number of responses to both. Conclusion Shorter LOS during the pandemic was a significant finding. Despite this, BMI on discharge remained similar, suggesting a shift to weight restoration due to lack of opportunities for an holistic approach due to restrictions. Key elements of treatment include careful monitoring of HbA1c and concurrent management of Type I Diabetes for those patients. The low response rate to questionnaires raises concern regarding their use, in their current format, as effective tools to measure outcomes. Though low numbers of questionnaire responses prevent firm conclusion, it appears that the reduced opportunities for elements of treatment to be undertaken in the community may have contributed to increased anxiety levels on discharge.","Cross, Emma, Morris, Jane","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+analysis+of+outcome+measures+in+a+specialist+inpatient+eating+disorders+unit+in+Aberdeen:+changes+since+2015+and+response+to+the+COVID-19+lockdown","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S181-S181, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26560,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on an inpatient mother and baby unit: a service evaluation","Aims Unique challenges have been faced by women in the perinatal period during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of this is compounded for women suffering from mental illness. This service evaluation looked at different aspects of the treatment pathway on a specialist inpatient psychiatric Mother and Baby Unit during the pandemic to identify what changes occurred. Method Data were collected for all admissions to the unit between January 2019 and October 2020, with the beginning of the pandemic being defined as on or after 1st March 2020. Information was collected retrospectively from electronic clinical notes on ethnicity, length of stay, diagnosis, mental health act use and restrictive practice, medication, psychology, occupational therapy and social services involvement. Result There were 114 admissions to the MBU during the study period. 4 were parenting assessments rather than acute psychiatric admissions and were excluded from the analysis, giving a sample of 110 women. 58% (62/110) were classed as â€œpre-pandemicâ€ and 43.6% (48/110) were â€œduring pandemicâ€. 95.45% (105/110) of women were postpartum 4.55% (5/110) were pregnant. Mean length of stay was shorter during the pandemic at 44 days, compared to 61 pre-pandemic. There was greater use of the mental health act during the pandemic: only 43.75% of patients were informal throughout admission, compared to 70.97% pre-pandemic. Mean duration of detention was shorter at 25 days (32 pre-pandemic). Psychotic illness made up a greater proportion of diagnoses during the pandemic: 56% (27/48) compared to 44% (27/62) pre-pandemic. The next most common diagnostic group was mood and anxiety disorders, which made up 29% (14/48) of diagnoses during the pandemic, but 43% (27/62) pre-pandemic. Outcomes as measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale showed a mean improvement between admission and discharge of 6.65, compared to 5.15 pre-pandemic. HONOS scores were higher on admission during the pandemic (12.83, vs 10.88), suggesting a higher level of acuity. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic on this Mother and Baby Unit, length of stay was shorter, a greater proportion of patients were detained under the mental health act (although length of detention was shorter) and psychotic illness was more prevalent. This study demonstrates that there were differences in this perinatal inpatient population during the pandemic and this may be a reflection on the wider impact of COVID-19 on perinatal mental health.","Cranshaw, Joanna, Seneviratne, Gertrude, Rao, Ranga, Ogunmuyiwa, Julia, McMillin, Rebecca, Ntephe, Chukwuma, Dain, Victoria","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+COVID-19+on+an+inpatient+mother+and+baby+unit:+a+service+evaluation","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S316-S316, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26561,""
"Improving quality of remote mental health consultations during COVID-19","Aims During the first wave of coronavirus pandemic, many Psychiatry outpatient appointments moved rapidly to remote or â€˜virtualâ€™ to protect patients and staff from infection. Telephone consultations do not allow assessment of appearance or other visual aspects of behaviour/affect, yet these are core components of Mental State Examination. Videoconsultation software was unfamiliar to many mental health clinicians, with obstacles including hardware availability, software provision and skills, data security as well as lack of clinican motivation and confidence preventing rapid uptake. I wanted to take advantage of excellent IT support, and NHS England funding of software licence, to drive introduction of Attend Anywhere patient videoconsultation (â€˜telepsychiatryâ€™) software within my local ADAPT (Anxiety, Depression and Personality Disorder,Trauma) Community Mental Health Team from April 2020 onwards. Method I assembled a small group of clinicans to take part in a local pilot of Attend Anywhere software. One Care Coordinator, a Consultant Psychologist, two Consultant Psychiatrists and myself completed satisfaction and confidience scores throughout an 8 week period. Number of videoconsultation outpatient appointments offered to and accepted by patients were also recorded. Weekly group meetings were deemed impossible to schedule given pandemic workloads, so we used 1:1 quick remote catchups, identifying and troubleshooting obstacles, working with IT implement a work-around when the team hit a technical brick wall. Result Clinician confidence and satisfaction increased significantly during this period, as did number of offered & completed video consultations. Attend Anywhere consultations were used for up to 25% of clinician weekly workload. Clinicians who manage their own diaries started quickly It was difficult to successfully engage Administration team to organise Attend Anywhere test calls, leading to slow uptake for Consultant Psychiatrists who do not manage their own diaries. Conclusion Patient obstacles to use of Attend Anywhere appeared to be idiosyncratic and multifactorial, including poverty, digital exclusion, lack of privacy at home, and clinical history of online grooming. However, some patients already used Attend Anyhwere software with their physical health teams, while others prefer videocall to phone. Age was not an obstacle. Once this small group of clinicians began to use software successfully, it had a snowball effect within the team and other clinicians asked to sign up for the service. Full support from Administration teams will be crucial to increasing videocalls within the service. Clinicians suggested offering videoconsultation as an opt-out service and requested additional functionality from the software to widen use.","Collins, Phoebe, krall, Karin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Improving+quality+of+remote+mental+health+consultations+during+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S180-S180, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26562,""
"Coping with a modern pandemic-an online survey of Anesthesiologists in India during COVID-19","Aims In 2020, India was one of the worst affected countries by COVID-19. As the pandemic spread, creating undue pressure on health care workers (HCWs), there was an urgent need for the development of appropriate interventions to protect their mental health. This study aims to study the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of anaesthesiologists in India and factors that influence their coping behaviour. Method The study was designed as a semi-structured, descriptive, cross-sectional, online open survey and conducted on Google forms between 21st May and 20th June 2020, among practicing anaesthesiologists across India. The participants were recruited by sending messages to their emails and through social media platforms. It created a small number of international respondents, who were also included (India = 301, rest = 23). The self-designed questionnaire had 30 questions in the form of multiple choices, checkboxes, linear scales and short comments. Informed consent was recorded at the outset. Details such as demographic characteristics, place and nature of work, pandemic related changes in duration or pattern of work, psychological symptoms during and after working hours, fears about quarantine, were collected in the survey. Statistical Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics for Mac Version 21.0 IBM Corp., USA) Result Among the 324 participating anaesthesiologists, a prevalence rate of 64.8% for stress, 51.2% for anxiety and 65.7% for depression was noted, which was double the rate from pre-pandemic studies. Those between the ages of 30 and 50 (p = 0.010 OR:2.191) and working in government run (p = 0.045 OR:2.564) COVID-19 hospitals in India (p = 0.002 OR:2.018), were particularly stressed (33.3%) and anxious (38%) than the rest. Increased workload, contracting the virus and becoming an infectious source to their family (88.6%) were their prime concern. Formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) (66.7%) and procuring personal protective equipment (PPE) (56.2%) were some of the challenges faced at work. Most of them recommended a congenial workplace (68.8%) and family support (60.8%) to help them work through their anxiety and fear, while a few reported considering leaving their career (34.8%) from fear of monetary loss and burn out (53.8%). Conclusion COVID-19 has changed the professional and personal life of anaesthesiologists in India. Irrespective of their workplace, their fears and challenges remain universal. Early identification of anxiety and depression and providing appropriate psychological support will prevent deep and enduring damages to the lives of these professionals.","Chockalingam, Punitha, Balakrishnan, Kalpana, Natarajan, Priyadarshini, Veeraiah, Surendran, Rajagopal, Revathy, Elumalai, Vinodh Kumar","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coping+with+a+modern+pandemic-an+online+survey+of+Anesthesiologists+in+India+during+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S244-S244, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26563,""
"Experience of tele-psychiatry during COVID-19 amongst doctors working in a mental health trust: A survey","Aims There is paucity of information about perspectives of psychiatrists about telemedicine practice during COVID-19 pandemic. It was intended to explore the experience of doctors using tele-psychiatry for provision of clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mental Health Trust covering four cities in West Midlands, UK. Method The study was conducted as an anonymized questionnaire survey. A 10-item questionnaire was designed with items related to the clinical outcomes, challenges and provider satisfaction when using tele-psychiatry. It had mostly yes/no dichotomous responses along with the scope for making additional comments for each question. An online link of the questionnaire was sent via email to doctors of all grades working across the Black Country Healthcare NHS foundation Trust, in the West Midlands. The survey was open between July and October 2020;and monthly reminders were sent. Result The questionnaire was sent out to 159 doctors and 34 responded (response rate of 21.3%). Just over 50% had used both telephone and video consultations, whereas 47.1% responders had used telephone only. More than half (55.8%) reported that the tele-psychiatry affected clinical outcomes;and it was considered positive in around half (52.9%). Most (73.5%) of the responders found that limitations or challenges of using technology impacted on delivery of care remotely. However 64.7% psychiatrists were satisfied with the process overall;and 79.4% reported that they would like to use tele-psychiatry in the future as well. Survey captured many observations from the psychiatrists. Positive comments from the psychiatrists included expedited delivery of care, reduced non-attendance rates, as well as successful multidisciplinary meetings. Challenges in specific sub-specialties such as Child and Adolescent Psychiatry or Older Adult psychiatry were reported where complete assessments were not achieved successfully. The process was felt to be appropriate in general for stable or follow-up patients in comparison to new or acutely unwell patients. There was some worry expressed about missing out non-verbal cues which assist with mental state examination. Conclusion Inspite of a low response rate, the survey provided some understanding about the experience of doctors practicing tele-psychiatry during pandemic. While technological challenges were acknowledged, tele-psychiatry seemed to have been accepted by a majority of doctors who are also willing to continue it in their future clinical practice. There is a need to explore in a larger sample involving both patients and clinicians about the beneficial effects of tele-psychiatry that can be incorporated in the usual psychiatric practice.","Chandra, Pallavi, Kar, Nilamadhab, Yahia, Abdalla","https://www.google.com/search?q=Experience+of+tele-psychiatry+during+COVID-19+amongst+doctors+working+in+a+mental+health+trust:+A+survey","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S13-S14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26564,""
"Sharing emotion while spectating video game play: Exploring twitch users' emotional change after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic","This paper examines how the COVID-19 pandemic associates with Twitch users' emotion, using natural language processing (NLP) as a method. Two comparable sets of text data were collected from Twitch internet relay chats (IRCs): one after the outbreak of the pandemic and another one before that. Positive emotion, negative emotion, and attitude to social interaction were tested by comparing the two text sets via a dictionary-based NLP program. Particularly regarding negative emotion, three negative emotions<U+2E3B>anger, anxiety, and sadness<U+2E3B>were measured given the nature of the pandemic. The results show that users' anger and anxiety significantly increased after the outbreak of the pandemic, while changes in sadness and positive emotion were not statistically significant. In terms of attitude to social interaction, users used significantly fewer â€œsocialâ€ words after the outbreak of the pandemic than before. These findings were interpreted considering the nature of Twitch as a unique live mixed media platform, and how the COVID-19 pandemic is different from previous crisis events was discussed based on prior literature.","Chae, Seung Woo, Lee, Sung Hyun","https://www.google.com/search?q=Sharing+emotion+while+spectating+video+game+play:+Exploring+twitch+users'+emotional+change+after+the+outbreak+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Computers in human behavior;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26565,""
"Representation of #CAMHS on social media platform TikTok","Aims The video-based free social media app, TikTok, has grown in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, with half of British children using Tik Tok regularly. With more than 2 billion downloads, it was the most downloaded app of 2020. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is currently found on TikTok via the hashtag #CAMHS. The aim of this study was to explore how CAMHS is represented on TikTok through reviewing the hashtags associated with CAMHS and exploring the themes of videos with the #CAMHS hashtag. Method The Tik Tok app was downloaded and a search for the hashtags which featured the word #CAMHS was undertaken. A thematic analysis of the top 100 most popular uploaded videos featuring the #CAMHS was conducted. The number of likes, views and shares of the videos featuring each theme was recorded. Result Videos with the hashtag #CAMHS had 203.9 million views, followed by: #camhsmeme(s) totalling 43.1 million views, #camhsjokes with 21.4 million views and #camhskids, 12.5 million views. The top 100 most popular videos represented 24% of total viewed videos with the hashtag #CAMHS. The most popular recurrent themes associated with the hashtag #CAMHS in our sample were: raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management (40% of videos), reference to self-harm (27% of videos) and negative perception of CAMHS (27% of videos). Raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management had the most likes (3,694,700) and views (17,435,900). This was followed by videos with themes of reference to self-harm (3,006,300 likes and 14,382,700 views). The most shared themes were: reference to suicide (shared 56,763 times) and videos which portrayed a theme of negative perception of CAMHS (40,628 shares). Videos with themes of a negative perception of CAMHS also garnered 1,762,500 likes and 8,666,900 views. Conclusion CAMHS is actively represented on TikTok through freely accessible unregulated videos. Videos with themes of raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management can potentially allow young people to share their experiences. Nonetheless, popular hashtags such as #CAMHSmemes and #CAMHSjokes, as well as videos featuring themes of negative perception of CAMHS, could potentially undermine the reputation of CAMHS to existing and future service users. The content of these videos should be taken seriously by CAMHS clinicians as it can potentially provide an insight into service usersâ€™ experiences of CAMHS on a scale that has not been observed before. Presently these videos are not screened or modulated by the NHS CAMHS service.","Chadee, Preetisha, Evans, Sacha","https://www.google.com/search?q=Representation+of+#CAMHS+on+social+media+platform+TikTok","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S241-S242, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26566,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients, their carers and Oncology health professionals: A qualitative study","Objective Cancer patients, carers and oncology health professionals have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, but their experiences and psychosocial responses to the pandemic are still being explored. This study aimed to document the experience of Australians living with cancer, family carers, and Oncology health professionals (HPs) when COVID-19 first emerged. Methods In this qualitative study, participants (cancer patients currently receiving treatment, family carers and HPs) completed a semi-structured interview exploring their experiences of COVID-19 and the impact it had on cancer care. Participants also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (patients) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (carers and HPs) to assess emotional morbidity. Thematic analysis was undertaken on qualitative data. Results 32 patients, 16 carers and 29 HPs participated. Qualitative analysis yielded three shared themes: fear and death anxiety, isolation, and uncertainty. For HPs, uncertainty incorporated the potential for moral distress and work-stress. Patients and carers scoring high on anxiety/depression measures were more likely to have advanced disease, expressed greater death anxiety, talked about taking more extreme precautionary measures, and felt more impacted by isolation. Conclusion Cancer and COVID-19 can have compounding psychological impacts on all those receiving or giving care. Practice Implications Screening for distress in patients, and burnout in HPs, is recommended. Increased compassionate access and provision of creative alternatives to face-to-face support are warrented.","Butow, P.; Havard, P.

"Virtual balint group experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic","Aims In the changes brought about by remote working, the local psychotherapy case discussion group (Balint Group) has developed as a remote service via video consultation. It is important to consider the effect that this change in method of delivery has had on experience. Method An anonymous survey was distributed to determine the benefits and challenges from participants and facilitators with at least a month of virtual Balint Group experience. The open-ended survey questions captured extended answer responses from 16 students and trainees, and 5 (co-)facilitators, within Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. The qualitative feedback was analysed by thematic analysis, identifying three main themes. Result The first theme of practicalities was centred around access to the group. The virtual format had benefits in terms of reducing travel and time commitment and so improving attendance. However, disadvantages were in technological issues and finding a private and safe environment, individuals often not leaving the work environment on which they were reflecting. The second theme of communication identified how virtual methods are a less natural way of interacting (for example sequential point making), losing both immediacy of reactions and non-verbal communication. There was a loss of essential communication cues, with disjointed conversation affecting contribution. The third theme of group dynamics had some advantages, feeling less intimidating virtually. Yet disadvantages included loss of group cohesion, with participants not building the same relationships (on arriving and leaving a group space), and trust. The more subtle emotions in the group might be missed and opinions given less openly. The facilitators needed to be more directive and experienced difficulties maintaining group engagement and managing the frame. Conclusion The advantages of virtual format are more based on accessibility and the disadvantages more experiential. There are elements of being physically remote that lead to a disembodied experience, that might impact on capacity to reflect emotionally. This might make it more difficult to identify unconscious processes and the experience might be more cognitive. There is a risk that virtually participants will feel more alone with difficult feelings and unsupported by the group. When mental health is being affected by social isolation due to the pandemic, having groups virtually can mimic this isolation in working life. Overall the preference remained for an in-person group. However, it was clear that access to some form of a group was important, to contain anxiety during these unprecedented times.","Brown, Rebecca, Philips, Nicola","https://www.google.com/search?q=Virtual+balint+group+experience+due+to+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S127-S128, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26568,""
"Trainees4trainees: an innovative peer support project for junior doctors across specialties","Aims The BMA's survey results (Caring for the Mental Health of the Medical Workforce, 2019) and HEE's NHS Staff and Learnersâ€™ Mental Wellbeing Commission report (2019) highlighted declining staff wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened focus on this and the effects of moral injury on healthcare professionals. Shielding, social distancing and redeployment led to many medical trainees being increasingly isolated at a time of heightened anxiety and adversity. Psychiatry trainees tend to have good access to reflective groups, but this is not customary in other training programmes. Method Intervention â€œTrainees4traineesâ€ was set up by trainees across specialties as a HEE-TV well-being project, led by the Deanery Trainee Improvement Fellow. Peer support groups are run on Zoom, facilitated by 2 trainees with special training in peer support. Psychiatry trainees have been involved in designing and facilitating groups and training facilitators from other specialties;facilitators have regular supervision from a consultant psychiatrist in medical psychotherapy. Trainees are supported to discuss challenging experiences and think about their emotional responses in a supportive and validating group. Result Feedback We are in the process of formal data collection to assess the impact of the intervention. Informal feedback suggests the groups are a powerful support to individuals who otherwise have no avenue to think about the psychological impact of their experiences. The groups have supported trainees to feel less isolated and bolstered their resilience. Conclusion Future plans We have faced challenges in the practicalities of establishing and maintaining groups. We are working with Training Programme Directors to move towards running the groups in protected time within working hours and advocate that reflective groups, such as our peer support groups, are a key part of future medical and surgical Training Programmes.","Behrman, Sophie, Higham, Aisling, Vlachos, Haido, Stegen, Gerti","https://www.google.com/search?q=Trainees4trainees:+an+innovative+peer+support+project+for+junior+doctors+across+specialties","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S126-S126, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26569,""
"Ordinary Magic in Extraordinary Circumstances: Factors Associated with Positive Mental Health Outcomes for Early Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions have had a negative impact on the mental health and wellbeing of many people worldwide, but this may have been particularly challenging for adolescents. However, there is a paucity of research examining the factors associated with good mental health during this time. The aim of the current study was to identify the protective factors amongst early adolescents in the UK that were associated with better mental health outcomes (internalising and externalising difficulties, and wellbeing) during the first national COVID-19 lockdown. Between September and December 2020, 290 11â€“14 year olds across North West England completed an online survey consisting of several measures pertaining to experiences of lockdown, and mental health and wellbeing. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyse the data. Results indicated that higher participant-rated lockdown experience (the extent to which it was fun, easy, and good) and higher levels of optimism were protective factors for all three outcomes of interest. Greater adherence to government guidanceÂ was a protective factor for internalising difficulties and wellbeingÂ only, while family keyworker status was protective for externalising difficulties and wellbeing only. Community and schoolÂ connection were protective factors for internalising difficulties;family connection and number of parents at home were protective factors for externalising difficulties;and peer support and family knowledge of COVID-19 were protective factors for wellbeing. In summary, the â€˜ordinary magicâ€™ of supportive relationships and positive experiences appear to be some of the key factors needed to maintain adolescentsâ€™ mental health and wellbeing, and to help them overcome difficulties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ashworth, Emma, Putwain, David W.; McLoughlin, Shane, Saini, Pooja, Chopra, Jennifer, Rosser, Benjamin, Eames, Catrin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Ordinary+Magic+in+Extraordinary+Circumstances:+Factors+Associated+with+Positive+Mental+Health+Outcomes+for+Early+Adolescents+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Adversity and resilience science;: 1-15, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26570,""
"Inspiring our future psychiatrists: a quality improvement project to optimise the medical student experience in community CAMHS settings","Aims To improve the structure, quality and experience of medical student placements in Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). To increase the likelihood of pursuing a career in Psychiatry or CAMHS by 50% over their 3 week placement. Background There is evidence in the literature of the widely variable medical student experiences when it comes to Psychiatry placements. Medical students from Kingsâ€™ College London (KCL) have a 3 week placement in Lambeth Community CAMHS services. Despite this being a good opportunity for learning and development, the feedback from students reports that they often feel lost and were unable to fulfil the potential of the placement. The main challenges reported were identifying beneficial educational experiences and gaining clinically relevant exposure. This exposure includes getting involved beyond observation and following a patient longitudinally. These challenges will likely have a knock-on effect on their attitude towards Psychiatry and overall enjoyment of CAMHS placements when there is already a struggle to recruit trainee Psychiatrists. Method A structured and immersive educational placement was designed through consultation with previous students, the multidisciplinary team and the university program directors. This included: A new induction Having a role in initial assessments of young people Formalised medical and psychology teaching Communication sessions Case discussions in a â€˜grand roundâ€™ format providing opportunity for end of placement assessmentFeedback was gathered using the Qualtrics analytical software, which was easily accessible through student's mobile devices. Pre placement questionnaires were used to assess the student's initial level of knowledge, expectations from the placement and motivation or interest in a career in CAMHS. Post placement questionnaires were used to assess any change in the above baseline scores. Brief, online feedback was collected after every clinical activity and was used to assess the interest and utility of each attended session during the placement. The questionnaire feedback was analysed and using these data, adjustments were made to improve the program for the next students in a â€œPlan-Do Study-Actâ€ quality improvement methodology format. We analysed whether improving placement experience and learning affected studentsâ€™ interest in careers in Psychiatry. Result The Quality Improvement Project is currently on-going and results are pending. So far, there is an improvement in student attendance and engagement following the introduction of induction, structure and active involvement in case management. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in community services having significantly reduced face to face contact, therefore our proposed changes for future cycles include various virtual elements. Ensuring medical students have access to online platforms such as Microsoft teams is vital in ensuring an effective medical student placement can be established Although the change to more remote working has been challenging , it is vital that medical students gain appropriate clinical experience during their Psychiatry placement to support further developments in Psychiatric recruitment.","Anandakumar, Brindha, Nunn, Lois, Daly, Fanchea, Dale, Ashleigh","https://www.google.com/search?q=Inspiring+our+future+psychiatrists:+a+quality+improvement+project+to+optimise+the+medical+student+experience+in+community+CAMHS+settings","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S171-S171, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26571,""

"A quality improvement project (QIP) to address communication and safety concerns from the on-call team at the Bethlem Royal psychiatric hospital out-of-hours through the introduction of weekend safety huddles","Aims There have been long-standing concerns about communication and safety on the Bethlem site out-of-hours due to its size, acuity and the number of specialist services;these issues were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A Quality Improvement Project was designed to address communication and safety concerns from the on-call team at the Bethlem Royal psychiatric hospital out-of-hours through the introduction of weekend safety huddles. Method Daily weekend safety huddles were introduced to improve communication regarding workload, acuity, new admissions, seclusion reviews, deteriorating patients;and to improve team cohesiveness and trainee support out-of-hours. The QIP team involved the deputy medical director, the associate director for speciality units, consultants, the college tutor, specialty registrars and core psychiatry trainees. Prior to initiating the huddles, the QIP team met to decide which specialties to involve, to agree on an agenda and liaise with other sites regarding existing huddles. Once the huddles began in April 2020, the team met periodically to agree next courses of action and to troubleshoot. The huddles initially involved acute services and eventually included CAMHS, Forensic, Older Adults, Specialist Units, all on-call consultants, the on-call registrar, two core trainees, the psychiatric liaison manager and the duty senior nurse. Result Data were gathered throughout the QIP using Likert scale surveys which were sent to all junior doctors on the out-of-hours rota. Paper surveys were used initially but were later replaced with Microsoft Forms to ensure anonymity. The percentage of respondents who answered â€œmost of the timeâ€ or â€œall of the timeâ€ increased across all parameters when comparing data from before and after implementation of the safety huddles. These results included improvement in: understanding of workload and acuity (9% before vs 69% after), discussion of new admissions on site (4% before vs 90% after), discussion of patients with deteriorating mental health (35% before vs 90% after) and physical health (22% before vs 83% after), understanding of number of patients in seclusion (61% before vs 93% after) and feeling part of a cohesive â€œon-callâ€ team (17% before vs 86% after). In addition, the results suggested a reduction in frequency of safety concerns on site (83% answered at least â€œsometimesâ€ before vs 62% after). Conclusion The results of the final survey demonstrated a measurable and positive impact on communications between the out-of-hours team, improved team cohesiveness and a reduction in safety concerns. The lessons learnt also influenced decisions made in formatting safety huddles at other trust sites.","Allis, Helen, Zahedi, Mariam, Stephenson, Thomas, Newson, Michael, Kumar, Anil","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+quality+improvement+project+(QIP)+to+address+communication+and+safety+concerns+from+the+on-call+team+at+the+Bethlem+Royal+psychiatric+hospital+out-of-hours+through+the+introduction+of+weekend+safety+huddles","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S170-S170, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26573,""
"Coping with and management of COVID-19 restrictions within the secure and forensic inpatient setting - a patients' and carersâ€™ perspective","Aims To seek patients' feedback on their wellbeing and the service adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic To obtain carersâ€™ views on service adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To establish impact on patients' wellbeing and progress in the context of COVID-19 Background The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented challenges faced by healthcare systems worldwide. Public Health England (PHE) provided guidance to manage the spread of the virus. In response to the national lockdown, the Forensic Healthcare Service part of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT) took measures that were considered necessary to prevent the risk of spread to patients and staff. Restrictions necessary to contain the virus included immediate suspension of all patients leave except emergency leave, suspension of visits by family members and professionals including legal visits and restrictions on multidisciplinary (MDT) members physically present on the wards. It was necessary to adapt our existing model of care to reflect and represent the challenges faced by such restrictions. A service evaluation project was undertaken to ascertain the patients' and carersâ€™ perspectives of the management of restrictions. Method Standards It is noteworthy that no service standards in the context of this unique global pandemic were available internationally, nationally or regionally at the time of undertaking the project. Methodology / Data collection An anonymous patient feedback questionnaire was developed to collect data on voluntary basis from all the inpatients within the secure and forensic CDS. Patients' feedback was broadly divided in to three sections 1) personal factors, 2) satisfaction with access to information and 3) satisfaction with services to include mental and physical well-being. Patients' feedback was collected during a 6-week period. For observation purposes, risk comparison anonymous data were also collected. Informal Carers' feedback was collected with regard to virtual visits. Result During the data collection period 99 out of 105 beds were occupied. The response rate was 49% (49 responders). Overall 73% of responders expressed that their mental health was affected. Approximately 51% of responders expressed that progress towards their discharge was very much affected. 91% of responders were not coping well with the new circumstances Overall, carers' feedback was positive in regard to provision of virtual visits. Conclusion Our survey has shown that the necessary COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have in some domains resulted in a negative impact on patientsâ€™ mental wellbeing and progression. However, it also identifies positive areas of new practice, which have been maintained by the service.","Ali, Syed, Glennon, Katie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coping+with+and+management+of+COVID-19+restrictions+within+the+secure+and+forensic+inpatient+setting+-+a+patients'+and+carersâ€™+perspective","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S308-S308, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26574,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on frontline health care workers in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study","Aims Frontline health care workers exposed to COVID-19 patients could be at increased risk of developing psychological issues. The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of mental health-related problems, specifically depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and insomnia among health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh and to compare these between medical and allied health care professionals. Method This cross-sectional survey was conducted using Google Form then subsequent telephone interview between June and August 2020. Using random sampling, a total of 479 health care professionals participated in the study. We collected data on demographics. Anxiety and depression were measured using 4 items Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), PTSD was measured using 4 items Primary Care (PC)-PTSD-Screen, and insomnia was measured by using a 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors associated with mental health symptoms. Result Overall, 17.6% of frontline health workers had symptoms of anxiety, 15.5% had depression symptoms, 7.6% had PTSD symptoms and 5.9% had symptoms of insomnia. Compared to allied health professionals (n = 113, 24%), doctors (n = 366, 76%) had significantly higher prevalence of anxiety: 21.1% vs 06%, (OR = 4.19;95% CI = 1.88â€“9.35;p-value &lt;0.001);depression: 18% vs 6.8%, (OR = 2.99;95% CI = 1.40â€“6.42;p-value 0.005);PTSD: 9.4% vs 1.7%, (OR = 5.96;95% CI = 1.41â€“25.11;p-value 0.015) and insomnia: 7.4% vs 0.9%, (OR = 9.22;95% CI = 1.24â€“68.4;p-value 0.03). Logistic regression analysis showed that pre-existing medical illness has significantly more risks of developing symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR = 2.85;95% CI = 1.71â€“4.76;p-value &lt;0.001) and depression (OR = 2.29;95% CI = 1.39â€“3.77;p-value 0.001). Having a postgraduate degree (adjusted OR = 6.13;95% CI = 1.28â€“29.28;p-value 0.023) and working in secondary care setting (adjusted OR = 3.08;95% CI = 1.18â€“8.02;p value 0.021) have significant predictors of developing anxiety symptoms among health workers. Those who had worked more than 6 weeks in COVID-19 dedicated hospitals had risk of developing symptoms of PSTD (OR = 2.83;95% CI = 1.35â€“5.93;p value 0.006) and insomnia (OR = 2.63;95% CI = 1.15â€“6.02;p value 0.022). Conclusion Our study demonstrated a high prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and insomnia among Bangladeshi frontline health workers (particularly among doctors) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to address the mental health needs of frontline health workers.

"â€˜Comfortable, safe and valuedâ€™: an analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on Hertfordshire's Community Perinatal Team","Aims This study aimed to assess the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Hertfordshire Community Perinatal Team (CPT) group interventions and the innovations made. Background The CPT is a multidisciplinary mental health service that runs three groups: Circle of Security (CoS), Emotional Coping Skills (ECS) and a peer support group - Wellbeing and Lifestyle. The service has received an increase in referrals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Methods: Team member and client semi structured interviews were conducted with answers transcribed in real time and analysed. Patient clinical records were accessed via PARIS and analysed in order to identify patient demographics within each group and whether these had changed during the pandemic. Clinical outcome measures and client feedback were evaluated to see whether the change in groups is impacting their clinical effectiveness. Result Results: Innovations made by the CPT include: groups becoming virtual, launching of the new Circle of Security Group which helps women tackle the â€˜Ghosts in the Nurseryâ€™ and strengthen maternal bonds, restructuring existing groups, breakout room forums and incorporating communication platform apps such as Whatsapp. The Wellbeing and Lifestyle Group increased in size and reach (7 women from 7 areas in 2019 vs 12 women from 12 areas in 2021) with an increased retention rate (71% in 2019 vs 100% in 2021) and a decreased attrition rate (29% in 2019 to 0% in 2021). The Emotional Coping Skills group experienced similar changes (10 areas represented in 2019 vs 15 different areas in 2021) with an increased retention rate (58% in 2019 vs 100% in 2021) and decreased attrition rate (42% in 2019 vs 0% in 2021). Conclusion The Hertfordshire Community Perinatal Team has responded to the pandemic by innovating existing groups and creating new forums;many of which will continue on even after the pandemic ceases.

"Growing pains: a scoping literature review of how perinatal psychiatry was impacted by COVID-19","Aims This scoping review aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the field of Perinatal Psychiatry and identify any innovations made as a result of this. Background The World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11th 2020. This pandemic has transformed the way in which Perinatal Psychiatric services are delivered in the United Kingdom and countries across the globe acting as a catalyst for innovation. Method The databases searched for peer reviewed literature written since December 2019 were: PsychINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PUBMED. Search strategy key words were: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, perinatal psychiatry and maternal mental health. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was utilised. Data were collated and summarized thematically. Result 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. The aforementioned studies included data from over 60,000 women from the following countries: China, Italy, Netherlands, United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, India, Spain, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, Iran, Japan and Nepal. Literature clearly indicates that during the pandemic there was an increase in depression and anxiety. Risk factors included: financial insecurity, disrupted antenatal care, isolation, poor physical health and domestic violence. Evidence also suggested COVID-19 stressors impacted feeding practices and infant development as cytokines pass from mother to baby. Perinatal Psychiatry services have adopted social media apps to provide antenatal information, teleconsultations, smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs and increased utilisation of screening tools such as the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale. Conclusion Whilst this review features literature centred on women from across the globe African women are underrepresented. This should be addressed in future studies. This review shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted maternal mental health and acted as a catalyst for innovation.

"The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the presentation of self-injury: experience at a tertiary centre","Aims The national lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have had a considerable effect on mental health, with reduced access to social interaction through work and leisure activities, and increased barriers to community mental health services. This study aims to evaluate how the presentation of patients with self-injury has changed during the first national U.K. lockdown, at a Plastic Surgery Tertiary Referral Centre in the East of England. Method Retrospectively recorded data from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020, spanning the duration of the first two lockdowns in the UK, were compared to the same period in 2019. The demographics of patients, along with the nature, severity and outcomes of the self-injury were recorded and compared. Result The number of patients referred for self-injury reduced by 22.9% during lockdown (2020: N = 42/109, 2019: 67/109) The most common attendance route was via ambulance during lockdown (2020:40.5% 2019: 31.3%) whilst the most common attendance route being via the front door in 2019 (2019: 35.8%, 2020: 26.2%) The number of new presentations with no prior history of self-injury was higher in lockdown 38.1%) compared to 2019 26.9%. The lockdown cohort had a smaller proportion of patients presenting with complications (2020: 9.5% vs 2019: 17.9%), less readmitted (2020: 11.9% vs 2019: 23.9%). Similar re-attendance rate (2020: 40.3% vs 2019: 38.1%) and re-intervention (2020: 13.4% vs 2019: 14.3%). A greater proportion in 2020 met the threshold for inpatient psychiatry input (2020: 52.4% vs 2019: 41.8%). During the lockdown, a higher percentage of flexor tendon injuries involved multiple tendons (60.0% vs 52.2%). A higher percentage of extensor tendon injuries (14.3% vs 7.4%), and a greater proportion of these also involved multiple tendons (66.7% vs 40.0%). More self-injuries were complicated by fractures (7.1% vs 4.5%) and more required soft tissue reconstruction (11.9% vs 3.0%). Conclusion Despite fewer patients presenting with self-injury during the 2020 lockdown, the injuries were more severe. Many of which had multiple structural injuries, and some with life-changing injuries, this is in line with our clinical observations. During lockdown there was a higher proportion of first-time presentations without a history of self-injury and an increased need for inpatient psychiatry input. This may reflect the impact on mental health as a result of restricted social interactions. These findings demonstrate the impact of lockdown on mental-health and may help inform medical services of potential changes in the presentations in future national social restrictions.","Adams, Tobias, Arnaout, A.; Bickerton, S.; Li, L.; Reid, A.

"Viral loads: anthropologies of urgency in the time of COVID-19","Drawing upon the empirical scholarship and research expertise of contributors from all settled continents and from diverse life settings and economies, Viral Loads illustrates how the COVID-19 pandemic, and responses to it, lay bare and load onto peopleâ€™s lived realities in countries around the world. A crosscutting theme pertains to how social unevenness and gross economic disparities are shaping global and local responses to the pandemic, and illustrate the effects of both the virus and efforts to contain it in ways that amplify these inequalities. At the same time, the contributions highlight the nature of contemporary social life, including virtual communication, the nature of communities, neoliberalism and contemporary political economies, and the shifting nature of nation states and the role of government. Over half of the worldâ€™s population has been affected by restrictions of movement, with physical distancing requirements and self-isolation recommendations impacting profoundly on everyday life but also on the economy, resulting also, in turn, with dramatic shifts in the economy and in mass unemployment. By reflecting on how the pandemic has interrupted daily lives, state infrastructures and healthcare systems, the contributing authors in this volume mobilise anthropological theories and concepts to locate the pandemic in a highly connected and exceedingly unequal world. The book is ambitious in its scope â€“ spanning the entire globe â€“ and daring in its insistence that medical anthropology must be a part of the growing calls to build a new world.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Viral+loads:+anthropologies+of+urgency+in+the+time+of+COVID-19","","Database: Africa Wide Information; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26579,""
"Covid-19 and the dialectics of global pandemics in Africa: challenges, opportunities and the future of the global economy in the face of COVID-19","The prevalence of global pandemics has been timeless and universal. In 1918, the Spanish Flue grounded Spain and her neighbours. In 1997, 2014 and 2020, the Ebola virus wreaked havoc in West Africa in the same manner that polio had ravaged the globe. Since 2019, the Coronavirus has forced most economies onto a downward spiral. Despite concerted global attempts at observing World Health Organization guidelines, the Coronavirus has been changing peoples' lives, forcing most economies onto their knees, endangering lives and livelihoods, making a mockery of global medicine and causing the widespread despair and helplessness that has come to be known as 'the new normal'. Unlike the other pandemics, the mayhem, complexities and dialectics caused by Covid-19 have been matchless, requiring a systematic study and necessitating a volume like this one. The volume's 16 well-researched chapters argue that despite Covid-19's enormous lessons and predictions about even greater future pandemics, humanity can ill-afford to relent in its determination to conquer the pandemic in the same way that human resolve has defeated past pandemic. As such, the volume provides hope and direction to the global community on how best to deal with Covid-19 and pandemics of similar or even higher magnitude in the future.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Covid-19+and+the+dialectics+of+global+pandemics+in+Africa:+challenges,+opportunities+and+the+future+of+the+global+economy+in+the+face+of+COVID-19","","Database: Africa Wide Information; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26580,""
"A framework for nurturing doctors: systematic review of wellbeing interventions in medical students","Aims UK medical students report high levels of stress, in particular within the coronavirus pandemic: 46% have a probable psychiatric disorder;almost 15% consider suicide;80% describe support as poor or moderately adequate. Our aim was to propose a novel conceptual framework for the implementation of effective interventions to reduce their stress and support wellbeing. Method A systematic review of MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases was undertaken with appropriate search terms, supplemented by reference searching. Published quantitative and qualitative primary research was included. Findings were reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses. Result Records identified through database searching 2,347;additional records 139;records following removal of duplicates 1,324. Full text studies included 41: â€˜Curriculum and Gradingâ€™ (n = 4);â€˜Mindfulness and Yogaâ€™ (n = 11);â€˜Stress Management/Relaxationâ€™ (n = 13);â€˜Behavioural Interventionsâ€™ (n = 3);â€˜Cognitive & Self-awareness Interventionsâ€™ (n = 2);Mentorship (n = 3);â€˜Education, Screening and Access to careâ€™ (n = 3);â€˜Multifaceted Interventionsâ€™ (n = 2). Effective interventions include those that reduce academic stress through grading changes and supporting transition to clinical training;resilience enhancing interventions such as mindfulness, yoga, CBT, group based exercise and relaxation;peer mentorship;faculty mentorship when actively engaged by the mentor;reducing stigma;improving detection;and improving access to treatment. Outcomes for clinical year students were less promising, suggesting interventions may be insufficient to combat clinical stressors. Conclusion We propose a framework for implementing these effective interventions through â€˜Ecological and Preventativeâ€™ paradigms. The former highlights an individual's interaction with their sociocultural environment, recognising multiple levels of influence on health: individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and national. At each level the framework of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention can be applied. Primary Prevention (intervening before health is impacted): reducing academic stress;resilience interventions;mentorship;peer support;brief interventions to avoid progress to established disorders. Secondary Prevention (reducing prevalence of disorder): early detection through staff training and screening;treatment referral pathways;reciprocal arrangements if peers are placed within local settings. Tertiary Prevention (reducing impairment): reasonable adjustments, communicated between placements This recognises that medical students require a range of interventions at multiple levels to reduce stress, promote wellbeing and manage the spectrum of mental health difficulties they may encounter. The ecological framework also acknowledges the reciprocity of individuals being influenced by and influencing their environment, which aligns with the concept of co-production.","Bradley, Rhian, Yousofi, Tahmina, Faruqui, Rafey, Hamilton-West, Kate","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+framework+for+nurturing+doctors:+systematic+review+of+wellbeing+interventions+in+medical+students","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BJPsych open; 7(Suppl 1):S240-S240, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26581,""
"Low Threshold Telemedicine-based Opioid Treatment for Criminal Justice Involved Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Report","Criminal justice involved individuals have a high rate of opioid overdose death following release. In March 2020, New York City jails released over 1000 inmates due to concern of COVID-19 outbreaks in county jails. The closure of addiction treatment clinics further complicated efforts to expand access to medications for opioid use disorder among criminal justice involved adults. The New York City Health + Hospitals Virtual Buprenorphine Clinic established in March 2020 offered low-threshold telemedicine-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone, specifically for criminal justice involved adults post-release. We describe a case report of the novel role of tele-conferencing for the provision of buprenorphine-naloxone for jail-released adults with opioid use disorder experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient is a 49-year-old male with severe opioid use disorder released from New York City jail as part of its early release program. He then started using diverted buprenorphine-naloxone, and 1 month later a harm-reduction specialist at his temporary housing at a hotel referred him to an affiliated buprenorphine provider and then eventually to the New York City Health + Hospitals Virtual Buprenorphine Clinic, where he was continued on buprenorphine-naloxone, and was followed biweekly thereafter until being referred to an office-based opioid treatment program. For this patient, telemedicine-based opioid treatment offered a safe and feasible approach to accessing medication for opioid use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic and following incarceration.","Flavin, Tofighi, Krawczyk, Schatz, McNeely, Butner","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000836","20220204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26582,""
"Social Determinants of Mortality of COVID-19 and Opioid Overdose in American Rural and Urban Counties","Both COVID-19 deaths and opioid overdose deaths continue to increase in the United States. Little is known about the characteristics of counties with high rates of mortality for both. We analyzed county-level data on COVID-19 mortality from January 1 to May 31, 2020, and on opioid overdose mortality during 2014-2018. The outcome variable, ""high-risk county"" was a binary indicator of high mortality rates (above 75% quartile) for both COVID-19 and opioid overdose. We conducted geospatial logistic regression models separately for urban and rural counties to identify social determinants of health associated with being a high-risk county. After adjusting for other covariates, the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 is higher in counties with larger population size and a higher proportion of racial/ethnic minorities, although counties with high rates of opioid overdose mortality have lower proportions of racial/ethnic minorities, a higher proportion of females, and are more economically disadvantaged. Significant predictors of rural counties with high mortality rates for both COVID-19 and opioid overdose include higher proportions of Blacks (Adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95%CI, 1.01-1.07), American Indians and Alaska Natives (aOR, 1.07; 95%CI, 1.02-1.13), and two or more races (aOR, 1.34; 95%CI, 1.13-1.60). Additional predictors for high-risk urban counties include population density (aOR, 1.12; 95%CI, 1.04-1.22) and higher unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic (aOR, 1.23; 95%CI, 1.07-1.41). Rural counties with high proportions of racial/ethnic minorities and urban counties with high unemployment rates are at high mortality risk for COVID-19 and opioid overdose.","Zhu, Fei, Mooney, Huang, Hser","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000834","20220204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26583,""
"Health-Related Behaviors and Perceived Addictions: Predictors of Depression During the COVID Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide implementation of measures to contain the virus from spreading, and social isolation was one of those measures. Social isolation is associated with increased susceptibility to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. Because this risk varies between populations and their respective habits, understanding which behaviors play a positive or harmful role is fundamental for people with depression under these conditions. This study aims to 1) compare health-related behaviors (HRBs) and perceived addictions between healthy individuals and individuals who reported having a depressive disorder at the time of the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal, and 2) test which HRB and perceived addictions are associated with depression. Participants were a matched for age and sex and comprised 968 adults divided into two groups: healthy (484, 50%) and depressed (484, 50%). They completed online self-report questionnaires, and the data were analyzed in SPSS. Logistic regressions showed that being a health professional, getting up in a later time during weekends, and a higher consumption of soft drinks increased the risk for depression. In contrast, higher education and higher intensity of physical activity decreased this risk. Perceived addictions to TV, social networking, and gaming increased the risk for depression. HRBs and the identified addictions associated with depression during the confinement should be targeted in clinical and community interventions.","Canas-SimiÃƒÂ£o, Reis, Carreiras, Espada-Santos, Paiva","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001503","20220204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26584,""
"Social media medical misinformation: impact on mental health and vaccination decision among university students","The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need of social media as a medium for gathering health-related information. Simultaneously, a slew of false information, primarily about COVID-19's origin, dissemination, prevention, treatment, and fatality surfaced, making it difficult to distinguish fake from genuine material. However, the possible effects on mental health and the extent to which this influences our decisions, particularly regarding vaccination, are unknown. The purpose of this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was to examine Lebanese University students' perceptions of social media influence during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to measure the impact of misinformation on respondents' mental health and vaccination decisions. In total, 440 students took part and were asked to complete an online survey that included questions on social media trust, the ""general health questionnaire index"" (GHQ-12), and a scale measuring ""attitude towards vaccination"". Our data demonstrated a low frequency of mental health disorders among Lebanese University students, which was correlated to frequent social media exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggested that students are more aware of misinformation and had lower rates of despair and anxiety than the general population. Furthermore, Facebook use was associated with worse attitude and behaviour towards vaccination (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), but a better mental health. Twitter had the inverse effect (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). It is a necessity to use social media correctly in health-related topics, to push governments and platforms towards making decisions about false and invalidated posts.","Jabbour, Masri, Nawfal, Malaeb, Salameh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-022-02936-9","20220204","COVID-19 pandemic; Medical misinformation; Mental health; Social media; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26585,""

"COVID-19 information received by the Peruvian population, during the first phase of the pandemic, and its association with developing psychological distress: Information about COVID-19 and distress in Peru","It is suspected that the information the population has about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) determines both its preventive measures and its effects on mental health. The internet and social media are the sources that have largely replaced the official and traditional channels of information. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the sources used by the population in Peru to obtain information on COVID-19 and its association with developing psychological distress (PD) and preventive measures against contagion.1699 questionnaires were analysed. A previously validated instrument adapted to Peru was used. Participants were questioned about the information received regarding COVID-19, its sources, time of exposition, assessment, or beliefs about it. Mental health was measured with the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire. Descriptive and bivariate analysis were performed, developing a classification and regression tree for PD based on beliefs and information about the pandemic.The most used source of information on COVID-19 in Peru was social media and this is associated with developing PD, both in the general population and among health professionals. The quality of the information about treatments for COVID-19 is associated with PD in the general population, whereas prognosis generates more distress among healthcare professionals. The biggest concern is transmitting the virus to family members, close persons, or patients, with more confidence in health professionals than in the health system.The health authorities should use the social media to transmit quality information about COVID-19 and, at the same time, to gather in real time the opinions on the implemented preventive measures. For all, this it is necessary to have higher credibility in the population to increase the confidence in the health system, looking at basic aspects for compliance with prevention measures and improvement of mental health.","GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado, Palomino-BaldeÃƒÂ³n, Ortega-Moreno, Fagundo-Rivera, Allande-CussÃƒÂ³, Ruiz-Frutos","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000028625","20220204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26587,""
"Social Media Use and Its Associations With Mental Health 9 Months After the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-National Study","The covid-19 pandemic has impacted the health and well-being of millions across the globe. Strict social distancing policies and periodic lockdowns has led to an increased reliance on alternative online means of communication, including social media. to examine (i) social media use and mental health in the general population 9 months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and (ii) mental health in relation to motives for and extent of social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. A cross-national online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia. Participants (<i>n</i> = 3,474) reported extent of and motives for social media use and completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. The data were analyzed by chi-square tests, one-way analyses of variance, and multiple linear regression analysis. Poorer mental health was associated with using social media to decrease loneliness and for entertainment motives, while better mental health was associated with using social media for personal contact and maintaining relationships. Overall increased daily time on social media was associated with poorer mental health. The social media use variables were responsible for a substantial proportion of the outcome variance explained. These findings were consistent across the four countries, with only minor variations. Motives for using, and time spent using, social media were associated with the participants' mental health.

"Rethinking hospital psychiatry in Italy in light of COVID-19 experience","Italy retains a distinctive organization of mental health services according to a community-based model of care with a multidisciplinary team serving a well-defined catchment area under the coordination of the local department of mental health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is forcing Italian mental health services to develop new organizational strategies at all levels of care in order to face the associated challenges. To explore factors associated with changes in psychiatric admissions to an inpatient psychiatric unit located in Lombardia Region, Italy. All hospital admissions (<i>n</i> = 44) were recorded to an inpatient psychiatric unit during a three month national lockdown in Italy in 2020 and compared with those occurring over the same time period in 2019 (<i>n</i> = 71). For each admission, a 20-item checklist was completed to identify factors leading to admission. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows, release 11.0. Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test) and Mann-Whitney U-test were applied, where appropriate. Hospital admissions dropped by 38% during the COVID-19 pandemic. No significant differences were found in demographics, clinical variables associated with hospital admissions and length of stay between 2019 and 2020. Compared with 2019, a significantly greater proportion of hospital admissions in 2020 were related to difficulties in organizing care programs outside the hospital (chi-square = 4.91, df 1, one-way <i>P</i> = 0.035) and in patients' family contexts (chi-square = 3.71, df 1, one-way <i>P</i> = 0.049).

"Reliability and Validity of General Health Questionnaire-12 in Chinese Dental Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) is a widely used instrument to assess mental health status. However, little is known about its applicability in Chinese healthcare workers. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the GHQ-12 in Chinese dental healthcare workers. Dental healthcare workers participated in the first occupational survey in China conducted by the Chongqing Stomatological Association from February 2021 to March 2021 by filling out GHQ-12. The reliability and validity of GHQ-12 were then tested. A total of 3,020 valid electronic questionnaires were acquired.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Forensic Mental Health Services and Clinical Outcomes: A Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on forensic mental health service provision and implementation. This study aimed to provide an analysis of the impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on routine outcomes within a large forensic mental health service in London, UK. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study using data collected routinely prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2018-March 2020) and then stages thereafter (March 2020-March 2021; analyzed as March-May 2020, June-September 2020, October-December 2020, January-March 2021). We used causal impact models (Bayesian structural time-series) to examine the effect of COVID-19 related changes on routine outcomes related to service provision and implementation. There was an overall increase in long-term segregation (LTS) hours during the pandemic; 140%, (95% Cl 107, 171%) during Lockdown 1; 113%, (159% Cl 127, 192%) during post-Lockdown 1; 45% (95% Cl 23, 68%) during Lockdown 2 and, finally, 90% (95% Cl 63, 113%) during Lockdown 3. The most negative outcomes were evident during Lockdown 3. Incidents of violence were significantly more frequent during Lockdown 3 than would have been predicted based on pre-pandemic data, including physical assaults to service users (206%, 95% CI 57%, 346%), non-physical assaults to service users (206%, 95% CI 53%, 339%), and self-harm (71%, 95% CI 0.4%, 135%). Use of enforced medication also increased during Lockdown 3 (317%, 95% CI 175%, 456%). The pandemic and its related restrictions negatively affected some service outcomes.

"Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in the New Life With COVID-19: A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study in Japan Rugby Top League Players","<b>Objectives:</b> The primary objective is to compare the prevalence of mental health problems, including psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms in Japan Rugby Top League players in the new life with COVID-19 with those evaluated before COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> An observational comparative web-based cross-sectional study was employed for Japan Rugby Top League players. We compared the data from 220 Japanese and 7 foreign players during the new life with COVID-19 with the data from before COVID-19, which was obtained from 233 Japanese and 18 foreign players. We measured anxiety and depression symptoms with the validated Kessler-6, which has been widely used in clinical and research settings among different populations. To investigate the distribution of K6 score and whether there are discrete clusters or not, we conducted the two-step cluster analysis. <b>Results:</b> In the new life with COVID-19, 15.0% of players reported mild symptoms, which was significantly lower than the 32.3% of players before COVID-19. The prevalence of moderate and severe symptoms was 6.7 and 3.5%, respectively, in the group during the new life with the COVID-19, and 4.8 and 5.2% in the pre-COVID-19 group, with no significant difference. A two-step cluster analysis supported the existence of these two qualitatively different clusters in both groups. <b>Conclusions:</b> With the spread of new lifestyles related to COVID-19, some rugby players may have improved mental health status due to changes in their daily living environment. Such environmental adjustments alone may not have been sufficient to change the mental health status of others. Rugby players or their teams may require mental health professionals and systems that ensure rest, adjust the environment, and sustainably provide more professional care.","Ojio, Matsunaga, Kawamura, Horiguchi, Yoshitani, Hatakeyama, Amemiya, Kanie, Fujii","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2021.1604380","20220204","COVID-19; anxiety; cluster-analysis; depression; elite athlete; mental health; psychological distress; rugby players","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26592,""
"Nightmares in People with COVID-19: Did Coronavirus Infect Our Dreams?","A growing number of studies have demonstrated that the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected sleep and dream activity in healthy people. To date, no investigation has examined dream activity specifically in COVID-19 patients. As part of the International COVID-19 Sleep Study (ICOSS), we compared 544 COVID-19 participants with 544 matched-controls. A within-subjects comparison between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods computed separately for controls and COVID-19 participants were performed on dream recall and nightmare frequency (DRF; NF). Also, non-parametric comparisons between controls and COVID-19 participants were carried out. Further, we compared psychological measures between the groups collected during pandemic. Ordinal logistic regression to detect the best predictors of NF was performed. We found that people reported greater dream activity during the pandemic. Comparisons between controls and COVID-19 participants revealed a) no difference between groups concerning DRF in the pre-pandemic period and during the pandemic; b) no difference between groups concerning nightmare frequency in the pre-pandemic period; and c) COVID-19 participants reported significantly higher NF than controls during pandemic (p = 0.003). Additionally, we showed that a) anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) symptom scores were higher in COVID-19 participants than controls; and b) quality of life and health as well as wellbeing (WHO-5) scores were significantly higher in controls than COVID-19 participants. Finally, ordinal logistic regression indicates that DRF (p &lt; 0.001), PTSD (p &lt; 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.018), insomnia (p = 0.039), COVID-19 severity (p = 0.014), sleep duration (p = 0.003) and age (p = 0.001) predicted NF. Our work shows strong associations between increased nightmares in those reporting having had COVID-19. This suggests that the more that people were affected by COVID-19, the greater the impact upon dream activity and quality of life.","Scarpelli, Nadorff, Bjorvatn, Chung, Dauvilliers, Espie, Inoue, Matsui, Merikanto, Morin, Penzel, Sieminski, Fang, MacÃƒÂªdo, Mota-Rolim, Leger, Plazzi, Chan, Partinen, Bolstad, Holzinger, De Gennaro","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S344299","20220204","COVID-19 severity; PTSD; anxiety; dreaming; pandemic; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26593,""
"The Influence of Personality and Demographic Characteristics on Aggressive Driving Behaviors in Eastern Chinese Drivers","Road safety research is important due to the large number of road traffic fatalities globally. This study investigated the influences of age, driving experience and other covariates on aggressive driving behavior. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Yixing City, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China. Regression analysis was applied to explore the influences of age and driving experience and their interactions with other covariates on aggressive driving behavior. Two analyses methodologies were used to assess the simple effect of the interactions. Firstly, the Jamovi automatic analysis classification program was used to calculate the simple slope test. Second, the SPSS macro program was also used to calculate the simple slope test also. A total of 570 drivers (247 males, 282 females) participated in the survey. A negative correlation was found between age and aggressive driving behaviors, and a positive correlation was found between neuroticism and aggressive driving behaviors in the multiple regression analysis. Significant associations were also found between age, driving experience, and depression, as well as age, driving experience, and neuroticism. Simple slope tests showed that depressive symptoms could increase aggressive behaviors in the elderly and experienced drivers. When experiencing neuroticism, individuals with higher driving experience were more aggressive in driving than shorter experienced drivers. Age and neuroticism influenced aggressive driving behaviors. Veteran drivers could be aggressive drivers when experiencing depressive symptoms or neuroticism. Mobile intervention could be sent to the potentially risky drivers, which would be safe and broadly feasible to prevent aggressive driving behavior in the background of COVID-19.","Liu, Chen, Huang, Jiang, Jiang, Liang, Qin","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S323431","20220204","age; aggressive driving behavior; depressive symptoms; driving experience; neuroticism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26594,""
"Adapting to the pandemic: longitudinal effects of social restrictions on time perception and boredom during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany","With the Covid-19 pandemic, many governments introduced nationwide lockdowns that disrupted people's daily routines and promoted social isolation. We applied a longitudinal online survey to investigate the mid-term effects of the mandated restrictions on the perceived passage of time (PPT) and boredom during and after a strict lockdown in Germany. One week after the beginning of the lockdown in March 2020, respondents reported a slower PPT and increased boredom compared to the pre-pandemic level. However, in the course of the lockdown, PPT accelerated and boredom decreased again until August 2020. Then, in October 2020, when incidence rates sharply rose and new restrictions were introduced, we again observed a slight trend toward a slowing of PPT and an increase of boredom. Our data also show that as the pandemic progressed, respondents adjusted their predictions about the pandemic's duration substantially upward. In sum, our findings suggest that respondents adapted to the pandemic situation and anticipated it as the new ""normal"". Furthermore, we determined perceived boredom and the general emotional state to be predictive of PPT, while depressive symptoms played a minor role.","Wessels, Utegaliyev, Bernhard, Welsch, Oberfeld, ThÃƒÂ¶nes, von Castell","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05495-2","20220204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26595,""
"IBD Patients' Perception of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pandemic and Satisfaction with Provided Healthcare: A Cross-Sectional Study","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is affecting public health systems and mental health significantly. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are witnessing vigorous organizational changes in inflammatory bowel disease centers and experiencing all psychosocial effects of the crisis. We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study in order to assess inflammatory bowel disease patients' concerns, behavior, and satisfaction with provided healthcare during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. All inflammatory bowel disease patients treated in our center from April 1 to June 1, 2020, were invited to fulfill an anonymous online questionnaire. A total of 132 participants have completed the questionnaire, 63.2% were female, 57.9% had Crohn's disease (CD) During the first wave of the pandemic, 74.2% of participants perceived themselves as a high-risk group for acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 only because they suffered from inflammatory bowel disease, and 66.2% thought inflammatory bowel disease medications make them more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019. This especially concerned patients treated with biologics (B = 2.068, P &lt; .01). Females were more stressed (B = -1.451, P &lt; .01) and concerned (B = -1.488, P &lt; .01) about the pandemic, and they also reported more potential benefits from professional psychological help (B = -2.664, P = .02). Six patients (5.3%) discontinued inflammatory bowel disease therapy on their own initiative. Seventy-eight (68.4%) patients were completely satisfied and 14 (12.3%) were partially satisfied with the quality of healthcare provided in our inflammatory bowel disease center. Female inflammatory bowel disease patients tend to be more emotionally vulnerable during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. Although psychological support should be continuously available to all inflammatory bowel disease patients, female gender may warrant special attention. Providing patients with adequate and early information during pandemic probably leads to better compliance and higher satisfaction.","Hrabar, Cacic, Biscanin, Tomasic, Kralj, Ogresta, Pelajic, Dorosulic, Babarovic","https://doi.org/10.5152/tjg.2022.21050","20220204","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26596,""
"Perinatal mental health service development across the UK - many achievements, growing challenges","Perinatal mental health service development had early beginnings in the UK, and there has been rapid expansion over the past decade. As individual nations address need in their own jurisdictions, differences in service models and priorities have emerged. Innovative opportunities for addressing maternal and infant mental health needs must be balanced against the demands brought about by societal change and the COVID-19 pandemic. With such significant change, there is a unique opportunity for services and service planners to share good practice and learn from others' successes and challenges.","Cantwell","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.1","20220204","Mental health services; maternal health; mental disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26597,""
"Protocol for a cluster randomized control trial of the impact of the Breaking the Man Code workshops on adolescent boys' intentions to seek help","Males in Australia and many other countries account for three-quarters of all deaths by suicide. School-based programs to support young men's wellbeing have become increasingly common in recent years and show much promise to tackle the issue of male suicide by fostering protective factors and mitigating harmful factors. However, only a few of these programs have been evaluated. This trial seeks to address the lack of knowledge about the potential for school-based gender-transformative programs to have a positive impact on boys. Breaking the Man Code workshops, delivered by Tomorrow Man in Australia, challenge and transform harmful masculinities with young men with a view to ultimately reducing their suicide risk. The trial aims to examine whether adolescent boys who participate in the Breaking the Man Code workshop demonstrate an increase in their likelihood of seeking help for personal or emotional problems compared to boys waiting to take part in the workshop. A stratified cluster randomized controlled superiority trial with two parallel groups will be conducted. Schools will be randomly allocated 1:1, stratified by location of the schools (rural or urban), state (Victoria, NSW, or WA), and mode of workshop delivery (face-to-face or online), to the intervention group and waitlist control group. The Breaking the Man Code workshops show great promise as a school-based prevention intervention. The trial will fill a gap in knowledge that is critically needed to inform future interventions with boys and men. Some methodological challenges have been identified related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, such as delays in ethics approvals and the need for Tomorrow Man to introduce an online delivery option for the workshop. The trial protocol has been designed to mitigate these challenges. The findings from the trial will be used to improve the workshops and will assist others who are designing and implementing suicide prevention interventions for boys and men.

"The wounded helper: moral injury contributes to depression and anxiety among Israeli health and social care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic can affect the mental health of health and social care workers (HSCWs) who are frontline workers in this crisis. The pandemic poses unique challenges to HSCWs as they face morally daunting decisions while working with limited knowledge and resources. This study examined the relationships between exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) and depression and anxiety among HSCWs. A sample of 243 Israeli HSCWs completed validated self-report questionnaires that include measures of depression, anxiety, exposure to PMIEs, perceived stress, and moral injury symptoms. About one-third (33.6%) of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder, 21.5% met the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, and 19.1% reported comorbidity of depression and anxiety. Beyond demographic, COVID-19, and work-related characteristics, PMIEs contributed to depression and anxiety among HSCWs. The integrative model indicated the mediating role of perceived stress and moral injury symptoms in the associations of PMIEs with depression and anxiety. The study's findings highlight HSCWs' mental burden during the COVID-19 pandemic and the important contribution of exposure to PMIEs to this burden. Clinicians treating HSCWs coping with depression and anxiety following the COVID-19 should also attend to moral injury symptoms.","Levi-Belz, Zerach","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2022.2035371","20220204","COVID-19; PMIEs; anxiety; depression; health and social care workers; moral injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26599,""
"Food security during the COVID-19 home confinement: A cross-sectional study focusing on adults in Malaysia","The surge in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission cases has led to the decision to execute the Movement Control Order (MCO) by the Federal Government of MalaysiaEconomic activities, psychological wellbeing, and food security may be negatively affected by the implementation of MCO. Therefore, this study aims to assess the prevalence of food insecurity and its associated factors during the enforcement of MCO 1.0. A total of 162 respondents were enrolled in this study using convenience and snowball sampling approaches. Socio-demographic information was self-reported by the respondents. Food security and the presence of depressive symptoms during the MCO 1.0 were assessed with Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), respectively. Current findings demonstrated that the prevalence of food insecurity was 43.2%. Ethnicity, marital status, employment status, monthly earned income and being the head of a household were significantly associated (p< 0.05) with food insecurity during the MCO 1.0. A higher odds ratio for food insecurity were observed among Malaysian Indian (OR = 2.541, CI: 1.041â€“6.205), those with active employment during the MCO 1.0 (OR = 4.175, CI: 1.189â€“14.660) and those with a monthly income of less than RM4000 during the MCO 1.0 (OR = 5.396, CI: 1.362â€“21.838). In conclusion, policymakers are urged to pay more attention to these vulnerable populations when formulating economic stimulus plans and coping strategies for food insecurity in the post-COVID-19 era.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hnm.2022.200142","20220301","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26600,""

"Online Telehealth Delivery of Group Mental Health Treatment Is Safe, Feasible, and Increases Enrollment and Attendance in Post-9/11 US Veterans","Post-9/11 U.S. veterans are clinically complex with multiple co-occurring health conditions that lead to increased morbidity and mortality, risk for suicide, and decreased quality of life, but underutilization and resistance to treatment remain significant problems. Increased isolation and decreased community and social support due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have exacerbated mental health risk. This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of home-based telemental health group workshops to improve reintegration and social connection in post-9/11 U.S. military personnel. Seventy-four (61 males/13 females) post-9/11 U.S. military veterans were randomized to receive 12 sessions of STEP-Home cognitive-behavioral group workshop or present-centered group therapy. Treatment was delivered either in person (traditional medical center setting, treatment as usual [TAU]), or via home-based synchronous videoconferencing (VC). The change to VC occurred due to social distancing guidelines during COVID-19. Mean age was 41.0 years (SD = 11.5, range 24â€“65). Forty-five (36 males/9 females) participated in VC and 29 (25 males/4 females) in TAU. Demographics were similar across treatment milieu. There were no differences in therapist treatment adherence for TAU versus VC. Therapist satisfaction was higher for TAU groups (q value < .05). Veterans showed higher enrollment, attendance, group cohesion, and veteran-to-veteran support for VC compared to TAU (q values < .05). Safety procedures were successfully implemented via VC. Results demonstrate the safety, feasibility, and high satisfaction of group telemental health in U.S. veterans. Higher enrollment and treatment adherence for telemental health delivery resulted in a greater likelihood of receiving an effective treatment dose than TAU. Strong group cohesion and veteran-to-veteran support were achievable via telehealth. Telemental health offers convenient, efficient, and cost-effective care options for veterans and may be particularly helpful for patients with high psychiatric burden.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2021.11.004","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26602,""

"â€œAbusers are using COVID to enhance abuseâ€: Domestic abuse helpline workersâ€™ perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on those living with domestic abuse","Purpose: Mobility restrictions enforced by the UK Government in March 2020 as a response to COVID-19 resulted in those vulnerable to domestic abuse being confined in isolation with their abusers, deprived of safe spaces and many of their usual sources of support. Domestic abuse helplines therefore became an increasingly vital avenue for victim support, seeing a substantial increase in service demand during lockdown periods. Method: Through semi-structured interviews with 11 domestic abuse helpline workers across UK services dedicated to a diverse range of populations, this project examined the nature and frequency of calls received since the first COVID-19 lockdown period. Results: Key themes identified through thematic analysis were: 1) Abusers weaponising government guidelines to justify and intensify abuse, and restrictions acting as both a barrier and facilitator to leaving an abusive relationship; 2) A loss of previously accessed support, with users uncertain about what help was available and issues around engaging with new forms of support; and 3) Isolation from social support networks, with callers reporting a loss of respite, lack of emotional and practical support, removal of third-party abuse monitoring opportunities, and subsequent mental health implications. Conclusions: These findings will act as a crucial guide for policy decision-making regarding support needs emerging from the pandemic and beyond, highlighting the importance of multi-agency partnerships, and urging caution in the utility of virtual alternatives to face-to-face support longer-term.","Zara Brodie et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0120-6AA-61D","20220204","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26604,""
"Mental health problems predict inequalities in accessing online classes during COVID-19 pandemic in youth","Background: Schools have adapted to the online environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the factors influencing access to online resources and the impact of these changes on youth mental health are largely unknown. The current study has two aims (1) to investigate if mental health problems previous to COVID-19 pandemic are associated with access to online learning; (2) to investigate whether those accessing online learning have lower levels of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample consisted of 672 young people (16 - 24 years of age) from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort that were enrolled in an educational institution and had access to the internet. Participants were evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic and in a previous time point. A total of 511 students were enrolled in online classes, while 161 were not enrolled. Psychopathology was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in both time points. Attendance to online classes during COVID-19 was obtained by self-report. Data were analyzed using multiple regression models. Results: Prospective analysis revealed that every one-point increase in the total SDQ score before the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase of 6% in the chance of a participant not accessing online classes, above and beyond previous negative school events, such as suspensions and grade repetition and other confounders (adjusted OR 0.94; 95%CI 0.91-0.98; p=0.0009). Cross-sectional analysis revealed that participants that accessed online classes had a slightly lower number of inattention/hyperactivity problems if compared to those without online classes (Cohen's d=0.25; ÃŸ=-0.63, p=0.006); however, those results were fully explained by previous symptoms of inattention/hyperactivity. Conclusion: Children with pre-pandemic mental health problems have disproportionately lower access to educational resources during the pandemic if compared with the general population, which might widen the gap of opportunities for this underserved population to thrive.","Patricia Bado et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00AC-0ED-CEB","20220204","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; youth; mental health; psychopathology; online learning; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26605,""
"Factors influencing acceptance of technology across age: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Digital technologies are creating unprecedented opportunities to improve and increase support to older people with cognitive and mental health problems, and to their family and carers. However, barriers that preclude the implementation of technology driven programs for the assessment and intervention of adults at risk of cognitive decline need to be better understood. This study investigated these outstanding issues, as well as considering the impact that the COVID-19 Pandemic has had on such barriers. Methods: A sample of 105 participants completed an online survey. Their ages ranged from 18 to 92 years. Of these,72%were female,83%had higher education and beyond, 42% were working, 42% were retired, and 14% were unemployed. The questionnaires assessed IT experience alongside awareness, attitudes, and stigmas regarding the use of technologies, particularly those used to support cognitive and mental health. Questionnaires also explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these technology-related factors. We compared these across groups of young (n=45), middle age (n=12) and older adults (n=48). Results: Relative to younger participants, older participants were less aware of, and held stronger stigmas against healthcare technologies, even though they reported more IT experience. IT awareness was associated to more positive (r=0.619, p<0.001) and less negative IT Attitudes (r=-0.271, p=0.015), more acceptability (r=-0.374, p=0.001) and receptiveness towards technologies (r=-0.610, p<0.001). Male participants appeared to be more aware of such technologies than female participants. However, relative to men, women had increased the number of ways and frequency with which they used technologies since the COVID-19 pandemic started, and older people in general felt more inclined to endorse the need to learn more about healthcare technologies. Conclusions: Having more accumulated IT experience throughout our lives may not necessarily lead to better acceptance of healthcare technologies. More awareness about such specific technologies will help overcome stigmas, and challenging environments such as those imposed by the COVID-19 pandemicmay lead to positive changes in perception and acceptance of such technologies. These are necessary steps towards the personalisation of healthcare technologies to support vulnerable adults at risk of dementia.","Panagiotis Kourtesis et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0221-EDD-2D6","20220204","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurocognitive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; pandemic; covid-19; aging; alzheimer's disease; technology; dementia","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-05","",26606,""
