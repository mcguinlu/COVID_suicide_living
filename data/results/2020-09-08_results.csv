METHODS: We used the depression-anxiety-stress scale and self-designed questionnaire on professional pride, intention to work in the front-line and the extent of family support. Medical students from 4 medical schools in Fujian and Hunan were investigated. Their mental health status, professional pride and first-line work willingness with different characteristics were compared, and the influential factors for professional pride and first-line work willingness were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected. During the pandemic, there were significant differences in the proportion of depressed students among different college and universities, majors and stages (P<0.05), and the professional pride was significantly different (P<0.001). Medical students with different mental health status showed significant differences in professional pride (P<0.01). Marriage, pressure and extent of family support were the influential factors for their professional pride (P<0.05). The latter two were also influential factors for their intention to work in the front-line (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, students from college and nursing have relatively better mental health and higher professional pride. The professional pride is low in medical students who married, with abnormal stress or low family support. The intention to work in front-line is decreased in students with abnormal stress or low family support.","Zhan, Juan; Sun, Shenghua; Xie, Lihua; Wen, Yijiang; Fu, Jianguo","https://dx.doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200440","","Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban;45(6): 649-656, 2020 Jun 28.; Publication details: Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban;45(6): 649-656, 2020 Jun 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4447,""

This study aims to investigate the mental health of patients with COVID-19 in Changsha. METHODS: We took cross-section investigation for the mental health of 112 patients with COVID-19 via questionnaires. Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were performed to compare general and clinical data between the slight-ordinary patients and severe patients. Single sample t-tests were used to compare the difference between the factor scores of the Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90) in COVID-19 patients with the norm of 2015 and factor scores of SCL-90 in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The obsessive-compulsive, depression, sleep and eating disorders had the highest frequency among the positive symptoms of SCL-90 in patients with COVID-19 in Changsha. The factor scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobia anxiety, sleep and eating disorders in patients with COVID-19 were higher than those of the norm (P&#8804;0.001 or P<0.05). Slight-ordinary patients with COVID-19 in Changsha showed lower factor scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and hostility compared with the patients with SARS (P<0.001 or P<0.05). There was no difference in factor scores of SCL-90 between the patients with severe COVID-19 and those with SARS(P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobia anxiety, sleep and eating disorders in patients with COVID-19 in Changsha are higher than those of the norm. However, the mental health of slight-ordinary patients with COVID-19 is better than that of patients with SARS. It needs to provide targeting psychological interventions depending on the severity of patients.","Qin, Xuemei; Shu, Kongliang; Wang, Mi; Chen, Wentao; Huang, Mei; Yang, Aiping; Zhou, Yun; Zhang, Yan; Ju, Yumeng; Liu, Jiyang","https://dx.doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200347","","Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban;45(6): 657-664, 2020 Jun 28.; Publication details: Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban;45(6): 657-664, 2020 Jun 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4448,""

This study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the front-line staff. METHODS: Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Fatigue Self-assessment Scale (FSAS) were used to assess the depression, anxiety, and fatigue in front-line staff. RESULTS: The detection rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were 49.1%, 21.8%, and 76.0% among the front-line staff. The rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue in community workers were higher than those in medical workers and other occupational staff (P<0.01). The PHQ-9 of front-line staffs was negatively correlated with age, family income, family members' support, satisfaction of service objects, and sleep quality (all P<0.01), while positively correlated with education level, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and the duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all P<0.01).

METHODS: A total of 373 medical staff from Xiangya Hospital and the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were enrolled for this study. The General Sociological Data Questionnaire, Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90), and self-designed public opinion response questionnaire were used to assess general sociological data, mental health scores, and ability to respond to COVID-19 related public opinion information of medical staff. The mental health scores of medical staff with different general sociological data and public opinion information coping abilities were compared. Influential factors of mental health were analyzed. RESULTS: The average score of 10 factors in SCL-90 of 373 medical staff was less than 2 points. 14.21% medical staff had one or more factor scores more than two points, including 11.26% with terror symptoms, 7.77% with compulsive symptoms, and 5.63% with anxiety. The main sources of COVID-19 information for medical staff included WeChat, microblog, Jinri toutiao, TV and radio. 66.22% medical staff regularly verified information about COVID-19 through official websites or formal channels. A great deal of COVID-19 information in WeChat could make medical staff nervous (34.05%), anxious (30.29%), and insecure (29.22%). 68.63% medical staff sometimes were worried about getting infected because they knew information about COVID-19.

"Benefits and adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine: searching for repurposable drug candidates","Repurposing of antirheumatic drugs has garnered global attention. The aim of this article is to overview available evidence on the use of widely used antirheumatic drugs hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine for additional indications. Hydroxychloroquine has endothelial stabilizing and anti-thrombotic effects. Its use has been explored as an adjunctive therapy in refractory thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome. It may also prevent recurrent pregnancy losses in the absence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Hydroxychloroquine favourably modulates atherogenic lipid and glycaemic profiles. Methotrexate has been tried for modulation of cardiovascular events in non-rheumatic clinical conditions, although a large clinical trial failed to demonstrate a benefit. Colchicine has been shown to successfully reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in a large multicentric trial. Potential antifibrotic effects of colchicine require further exploration. Hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine are also being tried at different stages of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic for prophylaxis and treatment. While the use of these agents is being diversified, their adverse effects should be timely diagnosed and prevented. Hydroxychloroquine can cause retinopathy and rarelyÂ cardiac and auditory toxicity, retinopathy beingÂ dose and time dependent. Methotrexate can cause transaminitis, cytopenias and renal failure, particularly in acute overdoses. Colchicine can rarely cause myopathies, cardiomyopathy, cytopenias and transaminitis.

"Health Behavior Changes During COVID-19 Pandemic and Subsequent ""Stay-at-Home"" Orders","The COVID-19 pandemic, and resultant ""Stay-at-Home"" orders, may have impacted adults' positive health behaviors (sleep, physical activity) and negative health behaviors (alcohol consumption, drug use, and tobacco use). The purpose of this study was to investigate how these health behaviors changed (increased/improved or decreased/worsened) at the early stages of the pandemic, what participant characteristics were associated with health behavior changes, and why these behavioral changes may have occurred. A convenience sample of 1809 adults residing in the United States completed a 15-min self-report questionnaire in April and May 2020. Multinomial logistic regressions and descriptive statistics were used to evaluate how, for whom, and why these health behaviors changed. Participants were primarily female (67.4%), aged 35-49 years (39.8%), college graduates (83.3%), non-tobacco users (74.7%), and had previously used marijuana (48.6%). Overall, participants primarily reported a decrease in physical activity, while sleep and all of the negative health behaviors remained the same. Changes in negative health behaviors were related (p < 0.05) to sex, age, parental status, educational status, job status, BMI, and depression scores. Changes in positive health behaviors were related (p < 0.05) to sex, parental status, job status, and depression scores. Having more time available during the pandemic was the most commonly cited reason for changing health behaviors (negative and positive). Public health efforts should address the potential for long-term health consequences due to behavior change during COVID-19.","Knell, Gregory; Robertson, Michael C; Dooley, Erin E; Burford, Katie; Mendez, Karla S","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176268","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 Aug 28.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 Aug 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4453,""
"Prevalence of Depression Symptoms in US Adults Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the policies to contain it have been a near ubiquitous exposure in the US with unknown effects on depression symptoms. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among US adults during vs before the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationally representative survey study used 2 population-based surveys of US adults aged 18 or older. During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020. Exposures: The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, &#8805;20). Results: A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3%), and after removing those with missing data, the final during-COVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2%] men; 933 [64.7%] non-Hispanic White). The pre-COVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4%] women; 1790 [62.9%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6% [95% CI, 21.8%-27.7%] vs 16.2% [95% CI, 15.1%-17.4%]; moderate: 14.8% [95% CI, 12.6%-17.4%] vs 5.7% [95% CI, 4.8%-6.9%]; moderately severe: 7.9% [95% CI, 6.3%-9.8%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.6%-2.8%]; severe: 5.1% [95% CI, 3.8%-6.9%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than $5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.95-4.77]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with lower social resources, lower economic resources, and greater exposure to stressors (eg, job loss) reported a greater burden of depression symptoms. Post-COVID-19 plans should account for the probable increase in mental illness to come, particularly among at-risk populations.","Ettman, Catherine K; Abdalla, Salma M; Cohen, Gregory H; Sampson, Laura; Vivier, Patrick M; Galea, Sandro","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19686","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;3(9): e2019686, 2020 Sep 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;3(9): e2019686, 2020 Sep 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4454,""
"Effects of COVID-19 on College Students' Mental Health in the United States: Interview Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Student mental health in higher education has been an increasing concern. The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. METHODS: We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students.","Son, Changwon; Hegde, Sudeep; Smith, Alec; Wang, Xiaomei; Sasangohar, Farzan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21279","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21279, 2020 Sep 03.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21279, 2020 Sep 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4455,""
"Impact of societal restrictions and lockdown on Trauma admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A single centre cross-sectional observational study","Societal restrictions and lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant impact on volume and nature of trauma admissions. We assessed the impact of COVID-19 related societal restrictions and lockdown on trauma admissions to single Level 1 Trauma Center in Westmead, Australia. We hypothesized that the number of trauma admissions would decrease and number of admissions due to self-harm and assault (specifically domestic violence) would increase. Data was collected from the prospectively maintained Westmead Hospital Trauma Registry. The primary outcome compared the average number of trauma admissions during March and April during years 2016 to 2020. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze means. Pairwise differences among group means were evaluated with Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test. Secondary outcomes compared were in-hospital interventions and patient outcomes. There was a 23-34% decrease (p value 0.018) in the mean monthly average trauma admissions during March/April 2020 compared with previous years 2016-2019. Additionally, there was a 40-52% decrease (p value 0.025) and 13-29% decrease (p value 0.020) in admissions due to road traffic collisions and falls respectively. There was a significant decrease in the overall number of trauma related admissions during the COVID-19 related period of societal restrictions and lockdown. This was due to a decrease in minor traumas, falls and road traffic collisions. There was no difference in the number of admissions secondary to major traumas, self-harm or assault.

"Health equity considerations in COVID-19: geospatial network analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant population in Singapore","Low-wage dormitory-dwelling migrant workers in Singapore were disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This was attributed to communal living in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission. The study examined the networks of nonwork-related activities among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit strategies and future pandemic preparedness. A population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related variables, and mobility patterns using a grid-based network questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the structures and positions of networks between workers and visit areas with individual attributes. COVID-19 risk exposure was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties, and visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city center was the most frequently visited for essential services of grocery shopping and remittance, followed by southcentral areas mainly for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to COVID-19. Social and geospatial networks of migrant workers should be considered in the implementation of lockdown exit strategies while addressing the improvement of living conditions and monitoring systems. Essential services, like remittance and grocery shopping at affordable prices, need to be provided near to dormitories to minimize excess gatherings.","Yi, Ng, Farwin, Low, Chang, Lim","https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa159","20200907","COVID-19; Singapore; health inequity; lockdown exit strategy; migrant workers; mobility patterns; social and geospatial networks; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4457,""
"Increasing ventilator surge capacity in COVID 19 pandemic: design, manufacture and in vitro-in vivo testing in anaesthetized healthy pigs of a rapid prototyped mechanical ventilator","The advent of new technologies has made it possible to explore alternative ventilator manufacturing to meet the worldwide shortfall for mechanical ventilators especially in pandemics. We describe a method using rapid prototyping technologies to create an electro-mechanical ventilator in a cost effective, timely manner and provide results of testing using an in vitro-in vivo testing model. Rapid prototyping technologies (3D printing and 2D cutting) were used to create a modular ventilator. The artificial manual breathing unit (AMBU) bag connected to wall oxygen source using a flow meter was used as air reservoir. Controlled variables include respiratory rate, tidal volume and inspiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratio. In vitro testing and In vivo testing in the pig model demonstrated comparable mechanical efficiency of the test ventilator to that of standard ventilator but showed the material limits of 3D printed gears. Improved gear design resulted in better ventilator durability whilst reducing manufacturing time (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°2-h). The entire cost of manufacture of ventilator was estimated at 300 Australian dollars. A cost-effective novel rapid prototyped ventilator for use in patients with respiratory failure was developed inÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°2-h and was effective in anesthetized, healthy pig model.","Dhanani, Pang, Pincus, Ahern, Goodwin, Cowling, Whitten, Abdul-Aziz, Martin, Corke, Laupland","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-020-05259-z","20200907","3 D printing; COVID 19; Mass disaster; Pandemic; Rapid prototyping; Ventilators","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4458,""

"Patient-reported Disease Activity in an Axial Spondyloarthritis Cohort during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in shelter-in-place orders and major changes to individuals' daily lives. The impact of such stressors on disease activity in individuals with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is unclear. The aim of this study is to examine whether stress, anxiety, and depression are associated with patient-reported disease activity, after accounting for important factors. We administered a survey to an axSpA cohort from a single center with well-defined demographic and disease characteristics. We included questions about job status changes, exercise, medication use, disease activity (by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI]), and psychological factors (stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety). Separate multivariable linear models examined the associations between perceived stress, anxiety, and depression with the BASDAI. After adjustment for potential confounders, those with higher levels of stress had a statistically significant 0.54-point higher BASDAI, on average, compared with those with lower levels of stress (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11, 0.97). Those with higher levels of anxiety also had a statistically significant higher BASDAI, on average, compared with those with lower levels of anxiety (ÃŽÂ²: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.99). The association between depression and BASDAI was not statistically significant. We did not find differences in these associations among subgroups of age, job status, or county of residence. Individuals with axSpA with higher levels of stress and anxiety had significantly higher disease activity levels, although with a difference below clinical importance. Further planned studies will evaluate the trajectory of disease activity.","Liew, Castillo, Zaccagnino, Katz, Haroon, Gensler","https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11174","20200907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4460,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Genitourinary Cancer Care: Re-envisioning the Future","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated rapid changes in medical practice. Many of these changes may add value to care, creating opportunities going forward. To provide an evidence-informed, expert-derived review of genitourinary cancer care moving forward following the initial COVID-19 pandemic. A collaborative narrative review was conducted using literature published through May 2020 (PubMed), which comprised three main topics: reduced in-person interactions arguing for increasing virtual and image-based care, optimisation of the delivery of care, and the effect of COVID-19 in health care facilities on decision-making by patients and their families. Patterns of care will evolve following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, virtual care, and telemonitoring will increase and could offer broader access to multidisciplinary expertise without increasing costs. Comprehensive and integrative telehealth solutions will be necessary, and should consider patients' mental health and access differences due to socioeconomic status. Investigations and treatments will need to maximise efficiency and minimise health care interactions. Solutions such as one stop clinics, day case surgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and oral or less frequent drug dosing will be preferred. The pandemic necessitated a triage of those patients whose treatment should be expedited, delayed, or avoided, and may persist with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in circulation. Patients whose demographic characteristics are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19 may re-evaluate the benefit of intervention for less aggressive cancers. Clinical research will need to accommodate virtual care and trial participation. Research dissemination and medical education will increasingly utilise virtual platforms, limiting in-person professional engagement; ensure data dissemination; and aim to enhance patient engagement. The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting effects on the delivery of health care. These changes offer opportunities to improve access, delivery, and the value of care for patients with genitourinary cancers but raise concerns that physicians and health administrators must consider in order to ensure equitable access to care. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the care provided to many patients with genitourinary cancers. This has necessitated a transition to telemedicine, changes in threshold or delays in many treatments, and an opportunity to reimagine patient care to maintain safety and improve value moving forward.","Wallis, Catto, Finelli, Glaser, Gore, Loeb, Morgan, Morgans, Mottet, Neal, O'Brien, Odisho, Powles, Skolarus, Smith, Szabados, Klaassen, Spratt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.08.030","20200907","Biomedical research; Health services accessibility; Mental health; Pandemic; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4461,""
"Child Maltreatment during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Consequences of Parental Job Loss on Psychological and Physical Abuse Towards Children","Job loss resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risk for child abuse. Protective factors, such as reframing coping, may mitigate the risk of job loss on child maltreatment. The current study investigated factors associated with child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, including parental job loss, and whether cognitive reframing moderated associations between job loss and child maltreatment. A community sample of 342 parents (62% mothers) of 4- to 10-year-olds (M = 7.38, SD = 2.01; 57.3% male) living in the United States completed online questionnaires regarding experiences with COVID-19, the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale, and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales. Two logistic regression analyses evaluated predictors of whether parents psychologically maltreated or physically abused their children during the pandemic controlling for maltreating history, parental depressive symptoms, financial stability, parent age, parent gender, child age, and child gender. Parents who lost their jobs (OR = 4.86, 95% CI [1.19, 19.91], p = .03), were more depressed (OR = 1.05, 95% CI [1.02, 1.08], p &lt; .01), and previously psychologically maltreated their children (OR = 111.94, 95% CI [28.54, 439.01], p &lt; .001) were more likely to psychologically maltreat during the pandemic. Regarding physical abuse, a significant interaction between job loss and reframing coping emerged (OR = 0.76, 95% CI [0.59, 0.99], p = .04). Among parents who lost their jobs, the probability of physical abuse decreased as reframing coping increased. Job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant risk factor for child maltreatment. Reframing coping may be an important buffer of this association on physical abuse and presents implications for maltreatment prevention.","Lawson, Piel, Simon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104709","20200907","COVID-19; Child maltreatment; Coping; Job loss; Pandemic; Physical abuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4462,""

"The mental health of neurological doctors and nurses in Hunan Province, China during the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak","Neurological symptoms are increasingly being noted among COVID-19 patients. Currently, there is little data on the mental health of neurological healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and influencing factors on anxiety and depression in neurological healthcare workers in Hunan Province, China during the early stage of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. An online cross-sectional study was conducted among neurological doctors and nurses in early February 2020 in Hunan Province. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Chinese version of the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) (defined as a total scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°50) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (defined as a total scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°53). The prevalences of probable anxiety and depression were compared between different groups, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to understand the independent influencing factors on anxiety and depression. The prevalence of probable anxiety and depression in neurological nurses (20.3 and 30.2%, respectively) was higher than that in doctors (12.6 and 20.2%, respectively). Female healthcare workers (18.4%) had a higher proportion of anxiety than males (10.8%). Probable anxiety and depression were more prevalent among nurses, younger workers (Ã¢â€°Â¤ 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), and medical staff with junior titles. Logistic regression analysis showed that a shortage of protective equipment was independently associated with probable anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.980, 95% CI: 1.241-3.160, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), while young age was a risk factor for probable depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.293, 95% CI: 1.137-4.623, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.020) among neurological healthcare workers.

"Commonly reported problems and coping strategies during the COVID-19 crisis: A survey of graduate and professional students","Background: The COVID-19 crisis has introduced a variety of stressors, while simultaneously decreasing the availability of strategies to cope with stress. In this context, it could be useful to understand issues that people find most concerning and ways in which they cope with stress. In this study, we explored these questions with a sample of graduate and professional students. Method: Using open-ended assessments, we asked participants (n=305) to identify their biggest challenge or concern (â€œtop problemâ€), their most effective way of handling stress (â€œeffective strategyâ€), and their most common way of handling stress (â€œcommon strategyâ€). We applied thematic analysis and evaluated whether participantsâ€™ strategies corresponded with evidence-based practices (EBPs). Results: Participants frequently reported top problems relating to productivity (27% of sample), physical health (26%), and emotional health (14%). Distraction was the most frequently classified common strategy (43%), whereas behavioral activation was the most frequently identified effective strategy (50%). Participants who reported a common strategy classified as an EBP reported lower depressive and anxiety symptoms. In contrast, there was no evidence of an association between symptom levels and whether or not participantsâ€™ effective strategy was an EBP. Participants who reported the same strategy as both their common and effective strategy (29%) reported lower depressive symptoms than those whose common and effective strategies were different. Conclusions: Our findings highlight stressors that students are experiencing and ways they are coping during the COVID-19 crisis. We discuss how these findings can inform mental health promotion efforts and future research on coping with stressors.","Akash Wasil et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-ECA-69F","20200908","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; evidence-based practices; coping strategies; public health; covid-19; top problems","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4465,""
"National Identification, A Social Cure for COVID-19? Evidence From 67 Countries","Social distancing and mass quarantines were implemented worldwide in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Prior research on the effects of social isolation has shown that such measures bear negative consequences for population health and well-being. Conversely, a growing body of evidence suggests that feeling positively identified with a group is associated with a range of physical and mental health benefits. This effect is referred to as the social cure and generalizes to various identities. In line with these findings, this study tested whether national identification could promote wellbeing and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we used survey data conducted among 67 countries (N = 46,450) which included measures of wellbeing, national identification, and subjective physical health. Mixed-model analyses revealed that national identity was indeed associated with wellbeing - despite adjustment on social belonging, COVID-19 perceived risk, exposure, and ideology. This effect did not extend to subjective health. These results suggest that the mere feeling of belonging to a national group may have mental health benefits and could be leveraged by governments. We discuss the implications of our findings within the social cure framework and their relevance for population mental health under COVID-19.","Eric Bonetto et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46020-FE3-012","20200908","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; social cure; public health; social belonging; national identity; pandemic","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-08","",4466,""
