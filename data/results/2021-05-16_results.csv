"Loneliness, but not social distancing, is associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak: a longitudinal study","Although social distancing is necessary to decrease COVID-19 dissemination, it might also be associated with suicidal ideation. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of social distancing and loneliness in suicidal ideation. We performed two waves of a snowball sample, web-based survey in Brazil (W1: from May 6th to June 6th, 2020; W2: from June 6th to July 6th, 2020). We assessed whether risk factors related to social relationships (loneliness, living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing) at W1 were associated with suicidal ideation at W1 and W2 using multiple regression models. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, mental health, and lifestyle variables. A total of 1,674 (18-75 years old; 86.5% females) were included in our longitudinal sample. Living alone (OR: 1.16; 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.03 - 1.30; p=0.015), number of days practicing social distancing (OR: 1.002; 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.000 - 1.004; p=0.027), and loneliness (OR: 1.49; 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.32 - 1.68; p&lt;0.001) were associated with suicidal ideation in the cross-sectional analysis of W1. Only loneliness (OR=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.12; 95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.06 - 4.24; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.033) remained significant as a risk factor to suicidal ideation in the longitudinal analysis between both waves. Snowball, convenience sample design limits outcome estimates. Assessments were not objectively performed. Loneliness was consistently associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation, while other variables, such as living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing, were not. Measures to overcome loneliness are therefore necessary to reduce suicidal ideation during pandemics.","Antonelli-Salgado, Monteiro, Marcon, Roza, Zimerman, Hoffmann, Cao, Hauck, Brunoni, Passos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.044","20210515","COVID-19; Loneliness; Social distancing; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-16","",13748,""
"The impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental and social health of children and adolescents","During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, governmental regulations resulted in a lockdown for adults as well as children/adolescents. Schools were closed and contact with other people was limited. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we aimed to investigate the mental/social health of children/adolescents during COVID-19 lockdown. Two representative samples of Dutch children/adolescents (8-18 years) before COVID-19 (2018, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2401) and during lockdown (April 2020, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°844) were compared on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: global health, peer relationships, anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger, sleep-related impairment by linear mixed models and calculating relative risks (RR (95% CI)) for the proportion of severe scores. Variables associated with worse mental/social health during COVID-19 were explored through multivariable regression models. The impact of COVID-19 regulations on the daily life of children was qualitatively analyzed. Participants reported worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains during COVID-19 lockdown compared to before (absolute mean difference range 2.1-7.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.9). During lockdown, more children reported severe Anxiety (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.95 (1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.89 (1.29-2.78) and fewer children reported poor Global Health (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.36 (0.20-0.65)). Associated factors with worse mental/social health were single-parent family,Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°three children in the family, negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A large majority (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on daily life. This study showed that governmental regulations regarding lockdown pose a serious mental/social health threat on children/adolescents that should be brought to the forefront of political decision-making and mental healthcare policy, intervention, and prevention.","Luijten, van Muilekom, Teela, Polderman, Terwee, Zijlmans, Klaufus, Popma, Oostrom, van Oers, Haverman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-02861-x","20210515","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-16","",13749,""
"Limits of remote working: the ethical challenges in conducting Mental Health Act assessments during COVID-19","COVID-19 has created additional challenges in mental health services, including the impact of social distancing measures on care and treatment. For situations where a detention under mental health legislation is required to keep an individual safe, psychiatrists may consider whether to conduct an assessment in person or using video technology. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not stipulate that an assessment has to be conducted in person. Yet, the Code of Practice envisions that detention assessments would be conducted face to face in all circumstances. During the pandemic, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, a statutory body with a duty to promote best practice of the Act, has been asked whether it may be acceptable and indeed preferable for some assessments to be conducted via video technology. Where an assessment is needed to determine if a patient needs to be detained, and where there is a need for social distancing or the need for 'shielding', remote assessments may in some circumstances be preferable. In this article, we outline the modification of the Mental Welfare Commission's previous outright rejection of virtual assessments as the pandemic progressed and discuss the ethical and legal issues the possibility of remote assessments has exposed. We also discuss the limits and when a virtual assessment is not considered ethical. As the pandemic moves from a state of emergency into a 'new normal' in psychiatric services during second, or subsequent, waves, the use and place (if any) of remote assessments for detention needs to be considered.","SchÃƒÂ¶lin, Connolly, Morgan, Dunlop, Deshpande, Chopra","https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107273","20210515","COVID-19; legal aspects; mentally ill and disabled persons; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-16","",13750,""
"A longitudinal study of changes in smart phone addiction and depressive symptoms and potential risk factors among Chinese college students","The current study aims to track the changes in the levels of smart phone addiction (SPA) and depressive symptoms between pre and during COVID-19 and potential risk factors of among Chinese college students in a four-wave longitudinal study. The participants were recruited from a Chinese university (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°195; 58.5% females). The first three-wave surveys were conducted before COVID-19 (during December of Year 1, June of Year 1, and December of Year 2 of their college study; Time 1, Time 2, Time 3), while the fourth survey (Time 4; during June of Year 2 of their college study) was conducted in June 2020 during COVID-19. COVID-19-related factors, including quarantine, lockdown, boredom, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness, were investigated. The results showed a significant increase in the levels of depressive symptoms and prevalence of probable depression during COVID-19 (69.2%) compared to those 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months and 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months before COVID-19 (41.5, 45.6, 48.2%) but non-significant changes in SPA. Boredom and emotional loneliness were positively associated with both SPA and depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Social loneliness was also positively associated with depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Quarantine and lockdown were not significantly associated with SPA or depressive symptoms. The results highlight that the study population may be a high risk group of probable depression. Future studies should continue to track these mental and behavioral status with the progression of the epidemic. The identified emotional factors could be used to reduce depressive symptoms during COVID-19 and prevent the potential risk of SPA.","Yang, Hu, Zhao, Xu, Tu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03265-4","20210515","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Longitudinal; Smart phone addiction; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-16","",13751,""
