"Anxiety and depression symptoms after COVID-19 infection: results from the COVID Symptom Study app","Background: Mental health issues have been reported after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, comparison to prevalence in uninfected individuals and contribution from common risk factors (e.g., obesity, comorbidities) have not been examined. We identified how COVID-19 relates to mental health in the large community-based COVID Symptom Study. Methods: We assessed anxiety and depression symptoms using two validated questionnaires in 413,148 individuals between February and April 2021; 26,998 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We adjusted for physical and mental pre-pandemic comorbidities, BMI, age, and sex. Findings: Overall, 26.4% of participants met screening criteria for general anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression were slightly more prevalent in previously SARS-CoV-2 positive (30.4%) vs. negative (26.1%) individuals. This association was small compared to the effect of an unhealthy BMI and the presence of other comorbidities, and not evident in younger participants ([&le;]40 years). Findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anxiety and depression was stronger in individuals with recent (<30 days) vs. more distant (>120 days) infection, suggesting a short-term effect. Interpretation: A small association was identified between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anxiety and depression symptoms. The proportion meeting criteria for self-reported anxiety and depression disorders is only slightly higher than pre-pandemic.","Kerstin Klaser; Ellen J Thompson; Long H Nguyen; Carole H Sudre; Michela Antonelli; Benjamin Murray; Liane S Canas; Erika Molteni; Mark S Graham; Eric Kerfoot; Liyuan Chen; Jie Deng; Anna May; Christina Hu; Andy Guest; Somesh Selvachandran; David A Drew; Marc Modat; Andrew T Chan; Jonathan Wolf; Timothy D Spector; Alexander Hammers; Emma L Duncan; Sebastien Ourselin; Claire J Steves","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.21260137","20210708","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15796,""
"Loneliness among people with severe mental ill health during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a linked UK population cohort study","Purpose Population surveys underrepresent people with severe mental ill health. This paper aims to explore perceived social support and loneliness and factor associations during the Covid-19 pandemic in a sample of individuals with severe mental ill health. Design/methodology/approach We sampled an already existing cohort of people with severe mental ill health. Researchers contacted participants by phone or by post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic restrictions had impacted health, Covid-19 experiences, perceived social support, employment and loneliness. Loneliness was measured by the three item UCLA loneliness scale. Findings In the pandemic sub-cohort, 367 adults with a severe mental ill health diagnosis completed a remote survey. 29-34% of participants reported being lonely. Loneliness was associated with being younger in age (adjusted OR = -.98, p = .02), living alone (adjusted OR = 2.04, p = .01), high levels of social and economic deprivation (adjusted OR = 2.49, p = .04), and lower perceived social support (B = -5.86, p < .001). Living alone was associated with lower perceived social support. Being lonely was associated with a self-reported deterioration in mental health during the pandemic (adjusted OR = 3.46, 95%CI 2.03-5.91). Practical implications Intervention strategies to tackle loneliness in the severe mental ill health population are needed. Further research is needed to follow-up the severe mental ill health population after pandemic restrictions are lifted to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends. Originality Loneliness was a substantial problem for the severe mental ill health population before the Covid-19 pandemic but there is limited evidence to understand perceived social support and loneliness trends during the pandemic.","Paul N Heron; Panagiotis Spanakis; Suzanne Crosland; Gordon Johnston; Elizabeth Newbronner; Ruth Wadman; Lauren Walker; Simon Gilbody; Emily Peckham","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.21260130","20210708","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15797,""
"Elucidating Post-COVID-19 manifestations in India","Background: In India, a large number of patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), presented with common symptoms including fever, dyspnea, cough, musculoskeletal symptoms (fatigue, myalgia, joint pain) and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, information is lacking on symptoms that persist after recovery from COVID-19. In this study we assessed symptoms that persisted in patients even after their recovery and discharged from the hospital after one month from COVID-19. Methods: This study is an observational cohort study. Participants in this study were enrolled between 30 to 40 days after recovery from COVID-19 of the age 18 years or higher, who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 disease. Outcomes from post COVID-19 participants were elicited through questionnaire that consisted of three main parts beginning from subjects demographical data, depicting about the status of COVID-19 and other co-morbidities of the subject, and about post-COVID-19 symptoms and manifestations. Results: All subjects have reported some manifestation after recovery from COVID-19 whereas numerous symptoms and diseases were experienced by a great percentage of participants. Fatigue (56.25%), dyspnea (74.3%) and disturbed sleep (64.3%) were among the most common symptoms. However, more critical manifestations like renal failure and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by only a few percent of the subjects. Rating of worse physical and mental health after post-COVID recovery was also reported by subjects. There was a strong relationship found in between the presence of other co-morbidities before infection like diabetes, hypertension and in disease severity after infection. A total of 280 patients were enrolled and 160 completed the survey. Conclusions: Post COVID-19 sufferers often experience symptoms that cause a disturbance in their physical health, mental health and their respiratory status for several weeks even after recovery from COVID-19. Therefore, all subjects after recovering from COVID-19 should undergo long-term monitoring programme for their symptoms and condition improvement.","Ghizal Fatima; Divyansh Bhatt; Jaserah Idrees; Bushra Khalid; Farzana Mahdi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.06.21260115","20210708","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15798,""
"Anxiety and Depression among Medical Doctors in Catalonia, Italy, and the UK during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Healthcare workers have had the longest and most direct exposure to COVID-19 and consequently may suffer from poor mental health. We conducted one of the first repeated multi-country analysis of the mental wellbeing of medical doctors (n=5,275) at two timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020 and November/December 2020) to understand the prevalence of anxiety and depression, as well as associated risk factors. Rates of anxiety and depression were highest in Italy (24.6% and 20.1%, June 2020), second highest in Catalonia (24.6% and 17.4%, June 2020), and lowest in the UK (11.7% and 13.7%, June 2020). Across all countries, higher risk of anxiety and depression symptoms are found among women, individuals below 60 years old, those feeling vulnerable/exposed at work, and those in poor health. We did not find systematic differences in mental health measures between the two rounds of data collection, hence we cannot discard that the mental health repercussions of the pandemic are persistent.","Climent Quintana-Domeque; Ines Lee; Anwen Zhang; Eugenio Proto; Michele Battisti; Antonia Ho","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.08.21260072","20210708","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15799,""
"Rapid vigilance and episodic memory decrements in COVID-19 survivors","Recent studies indicate that COVID-19 infection can lead to serious neurological consequences in a small percentage of individuals. However, in the months following acute illness, many more suffer from fatigue, low motivation, disturbed mood, poor sleep and cognitive symptoms, colloquially referred to as 'brain fog'. But what about individuals who do not report any ongoing symptoms after recovering from COVID-19? Here we examined a wide range of cognitive functions critical for daily life (including sustained attention, memory, motor control, planning, semantic reasoning, mental rotation and spatial-visual attention) in people who had previously suffered from COVID-19 but were not significantly different from a control group on self-reported fatigue, forgetfulness, sleep abnormality, motivation, depression, anxiety and personality profile. COVID-19 survivors displayed significantly worse episodic memory (up to 6 months post infection) and greater decline in vigilance and motivation with time on task (for up to 9 months). Overall, the results show that chronic cognitive impairments following COVID-19 are evident on objective testing even amongst those who do not report a greater symptom burden. Importantly, in the sample tested here, these were not significantly different from normal after six-nine months, demonstrating evidence of recovery over time.","Sijia Zhao; Kengo Shibata; Peter J.

"Sex- and Gender-specific Risk Factors of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome: A Population-based Cohort Study in Switzerland","BackgroundEvidence to date indicates that mortality of acute coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is higher in men than in women. Conversely, women seem more likely to suffer from long-term consequences of the disease and pronounced negative social and economic impacts. Sex- and gender specific risk factors of COVID-19-related long-term effects are unknown.

MethodsWe conducted a multicentre prospective observational cohort study of 5838 (44.6% women) individuals in Switzerland who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA between February and December 2020. Of all surviving individuals who met the inclusion criteria, 2799 (1285 [45.9%] women) completed a follow-up questionnaire.

FindingsAfter a mean follow-up time of 197{+/-}77 days, women more often reported at least one persistent symptom (43.0% vs 31.5%, p<0.001) with reduced exercise tolerance and reduced resilience being the most frequently reported symptom in both sexes. Critical illness (intermediate or intensive care unit admission) during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio[95%CI]: 4.00[2.66-6.02], p<0.0001 was a risk factor of post-COVID syndrome in both women and men. Women with pre-existing mental illness (1.81[1.00-3.26], p=0.049), cardiovascular risk factors (1.39[1.03-1.89], p=0.033), higher self-reported domestic stress levels (1.15[1.08-1.22], p<0.0001), and feminine gender identity (1.12[1.02-1.24], p=0.02) increased the odds of experiencing post-COVID syndrome. Conversely, obesity (1.44[1.03-2.02], p=0.034) increased the odds of post-COVID syndrome in men, but not in women. Being responsible for household work (men, OR 0.82[0.69-0.97], p=0.021), taking care of children/relatives (women, 0.90[0.84-0.96], p=0.002) or being pregnant at the time of acute COVID-19 illness (OR 0.48[0.23-1.01], p=0.054) was associated with lower odds of post-COVID syndrome.

InterpretationPredictors of post-COVID syndrome differ between men and women. Our data reinforce the importance to include sex and gender to identify patients at risk for post-COVID syndrome so that access to care and early intervention can be tailored to their different needs.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe performed a PubMed search for studies investigating short- and long-term health sequelae in COVID-19 survivors. We included all studies published prior to May 30th, 2021. The search comprised the following terms: (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus disease 2019 OR 2019-nCoV) AND (post COVID OR long COVID OR survivor OR recover OR persistent OR follow up OR discharge OR long-term OR sequelae). Previous studies have reported a variety of symptoms in COVID-19 survivors from different countries such as China (Wuhan), the UK, and the U.S. Overall, these studies showed that a substantial burden of health issues spanning multiple organ systems is experienced by patients who survive after the acute phase of COVID-19. The most frequent symptoms reported after acute infection were fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep disturbances, headache, dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, and anosmia. Two studies indicate that women are overrepresented amongst post-COVID-19 syndrome patients suffering from fatigue, headache, dyspnoea, or anosmia. However, the representativeness of the studies and the explicitness of provided information were insufficient due to lacking variables and/or small numbers of cases and the short duration of follow-up. Sex-and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 syndrome are currently unknown.

Added value of this studyIn a large cohort study (n=2799) with long follow-up (mean follow-up 197{+/-}77 days), we investigated sex- and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 health sequalae. Our data allow for identification of sex- and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 syndrome. In a multivariable association model, post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with severity of illness and number of symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in both sexes, while pre-existing mental illness and cardiovascular risk factors were significant predictors only in women. Conversely, obesity was independently associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome in men, but not in women. Gender-related risk factors of post-COVID syndrome were feminine traits and higher amount of domestic stress, both increasing the odds of post-COVID-19 syndrome in women, while pregnancy during acute COVID-19 illness and responsibility for childcare protected women, and responsibility for household work protected men from experiencing post-COVID-19 syndrome.

Implications of all the available evidenceEvidence indicates that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women. We provide evidence that female sex and gender is associated with long-term sequalae of COVID-19. Our data reinforce the importance of including gender to identify patients at risk for post-COVID-19 syndrome so that the functional return of both male and female COVID-19 survivors can be maximized.","Caroline E Gebhard; Claudia Suetsch; Susan Bengs; Manja Deforth; Karl Philipp Buehler; Nadia Nadia Hamouda; Alexander Meisel; Reto A Schuepbach; Annelies S Zinkernagel; Silvio Daniel Brugger; Claudio Acevedo; Dimitri Patriki; Benedikt Wiggli; Juerg H Beer; Andree Friedl; Raphael Twerenbold; Gabriela M Kuster; Hans Pargger; Sarah Tschudin-Sutter; Joerg C Schefold; Thibaud Spinetti; Arnaud Dussault-Cloutier; Chiara Henze; Mina Pasqualini; Dominik F Sager; Lilian Mayrhofer; Mirjam Caroline Grieder; Janna Tontsch; Fabian Franzeck; Pedro David Wendel Garcia; Daniel A Hofmaenner; Thomas Scheier; Jan Daniel Bartussek; Leon Chrobok; David Staehli; Nicola Lott; Muriel Graemer; Nidaa Mikail; Alexia Rossi; Nuria Zellweger; Petra Opic; Angela Portmann; Atanas Todorov; Aju P Pazhenkottil; Michael Messerli; Ahmed Haider; Ronny R Buechel; Philipp A Kaufmann; Valerie Treyer; Martin Siegemund; Ulrike Held; Vera Regitz-Zagrosek; Catherine Gebhard","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.21259757","20210706","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15801,""
"The relationship between postpartum depression and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","This study aims to examine the prevalence of postpartum depression and its relationship with social support adjusted for self-perceived impact of COVID-19 in parturient women admitted to a perinatal medical center in Japan. This cross-sectional study included 513 women who underwent a 1-month postpartum checkup between August 3 and November 27, 2020. Postpartum depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Social support was measured using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and the score was dichotomized using the Youden index. Nineteen demographic and obstetric characteristics were also assessed. Postpartum depression was observed in 35 (7.6%) of 461 women: 25 (26.6%) and 10 (2.7%) in the low- and high-support groups, respectively. Women in the low-support group were significantly more likely to have postpartum depression than those in the high-support group (odds ratio [OR], 11.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-27.3; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Furthermore, no interaction was observed between social support and the impact of COVID-19 for postpartum depression (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.32). The prevalence of postpartum depression in the study institution was lower than that reported by previous studies in Japan. Moreover, social support was an important predictive factor for postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Terada, Kinjo, Fukuda","https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14929","20210708","COVID-19; Edinburgh postnatal depression scale; depression; postpartum period; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15802,""
"Iranian psychosocial status during and after COVID-19 outbreak mandatory quarantine: A cross-sectional study","Quarantine, one of the most effective protection measures, plays an essential role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, along with quarantine, can have devastating consequences for individuals' mental and social health. This study examined the psychosocial status of individuals during and after quarantine in the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 714 individuals in the general population during (365) and 3 months after quarantine (349) in southeastern Iran. Data were collected using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) based on an online questionnaire. Data were collected from April 13 to April 20, 2020 (in quarantine) and 3 months later from August 20 to September 20, 2020. Psychological disorders in the quarantined population were significantly higher than that after quarantine. The risk of a mental disorder in the quarantined population was 1.54 times higher than that after quarantine. The results showed that quarantine is associated with a significant level of psychosocial disorders; therefore, interventions should be considered to reduce the effects of quarantine on the mental health of general population as a public health priority at the community level.","Zakeri, Maazallahi, Ehsani, Dehghan","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22647","20210708","COVID-19; anxiety; health; population; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15803,""
"Declining well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals US social inequities","The COVID-19 pandemic led to mental health fallout in the US; yet research about mental health and COVID-19 primarily rely on samples that may overlook variance in regional mental health. Indeed, between-city comparisons of mental health decline in the US may provide further insight into how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting at-risk groups. This study leverages social media and COVID-19-city infection data to measure the longitudinal (January 22- July 31, 2020) mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 20 metropolitan areas. We used longitudinal VADER sentiment analysis of Twitter timelines (January-July 2020) for cohorts in 20 metropolitan areas to examine mood changes over time. We then conducted simple and multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions to examine the relationship between COVID-19 infection city data, population, population density, and city demographics on sentiment across those 20 cities. Longitudinal sentiment tracking showed mood declines over time. The univariate OLS regression highlighted a negative linear relationship between COVID-19 city data and online sentiment (ÃŽÂ² = -.017). Residing in predominantly white cities had a protective effect against COVID-19 driven negative mood (ÃŽÂ² = .0629, p &lt; .001). Our results reveal that metropolitan areas with larger communities of color experienced a greater subjective well-being decline than predominantly white cities, which we attribute to clinical and socioeconomic correlates that place communities of color at greater risk of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is a driver of declining US mood in 20 metropolitan cities. Other factors, including social unrest and local demographics, may compound and exacerbate mental health outlook in racially diverse cities.","Bathina, Ten Thij, Valdez, Rutter, Bollen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254114","20210708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15804,""
"Outcomes Among Patients Referred to Outpatient Rehabilitation Clinics After COVID-19 diagnosis - United States, January 2020-March 2021","As of June 30, 2021, 33.5 million persons in the United States had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 (1). Although most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, recover within a few weeks, some experience post-COVID-19 conditions. These range from new or returning to ongoing health problems that can continue beyond 4 weeks. Persons who were asymptomatic at the time of infection can also experience post-COVID-19 conditions. Data on post-COVID-19 conditions are emerging and information on rehabilitation needs among persons recovering from COVID-19 is limited. Using data acquired during January 2020-March 2021 from Select Medical* outpatient rehabilitation clinics, CDC compared patient-reported measures of health, physical endurance, and health care use between patients who had recovered from COVID-19 (post-COVID-19 patients) and patients needing rehabilitation because of a current or previous diagnosis of a neoplasm (cancer) who had not experienced COVID-19 (control patients). All patients had been referred to outpatient rehabilitation. Compared with control patients, post-COVID-19 patients had higher age- and sex-adjusted odds of reporting worse physical health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.8), pain (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.3), and difficulty with physical activities (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.6). Post-COVID-19 patients also had worse physical endurance, measured by the 6-minute walk test<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup> (6MWT) (p&lt;0.001) compared with control patients. Among patients referred to outpatient rehabilitation, those recovering from COVID-19 had poorer physical health and functional status than those who had cancer, or were recovering from cancer but not COVID-19. Patients recovering from COVID-19 might need additional clinical support, including tailored physical and mental health rehabilitation services.","Rogers-Brown, Wanga, Okoro, Brozowsky, Evans, Hopwood, Cope, Jackson, Bushman, Hernandez-Romieu, Bonacci, McLeod, Chevinsky, Goodman, Dixson, Lufty, Rushmore, Koumans, Morris, Thompson","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7027a2","20210708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15805,""
"Exploring the Complex Pathways between the Fear of COVID-19 and Preventive Health Behavior among Nigerians: Mediation and Moderation Analyses","Since COVID-19 currently has no proven cure but high morbidity and mortality; many people are living in fear of the virus along with other mental health challenges induced by the lockdowns and social distancing. Hence, this study aims to provide evidence on the co-occurrence and inter-relations between the fear of COVID-19, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and psychological distress in adherence to preventive health behavior among Nigerians. It also seeks to determine whether this process differs for men and women. The sample comprised 1,172 consenting young adults (mean age = 22.9 Ã‚Â± 6.6 years, 54.5% females) selected using a snowball sampling technique. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the mediation model of post-traumatic stress symptoms and psychological distress as parallel and serial mediators of the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and preventive health behavior. The indirect effect of the fear of COVID-19 on preventive health behavior across gender was tested using moderation analysis. Results showed that post-traumatic stress symptoms and psychological distress serially and fully, in causal order, mediated the association between the fear of COVID-19 and preventive health behavior, and gender moderated the mediation effects. The research provides evidence that the fear of COVID-19 could trigger preventive health behavior through post-traumatic stress symptoms but reduces it through psychological distress, whereas the fear of COVID-19 has a slightly more positive impact on preventive health behavior among men.","Ayandele, Ramos-Vera, Iorfa, Chovwen, Olapegba","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0994","20210708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15806,""

Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25-item were administered. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with psychological ill-effects and resilience. DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress scores were high; these were associated with difficulties with infection control measures, autism diagnosis, and need for early intervention services. For caregivers of children with ASD, our DASS-21 scores were significantly higher than non-pandemic scores locally and in other Asian sites. Resilience scores correlated inversely with DASS-21 scores.

"Scaling Up Global Mental Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond","Every health care system requires an adequate health care workforce, service delivery, financial support, and information technology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, global health systems were ill prepared to address the rising prevalence of mental health problems, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), thereby increasing treatment gaps. To close these gaps globally, task shifting and telepsychiatry should be made available and maximized, particularly in LMICs. Task shifting to nonspecialist health workers to improve essential mental health coverage and encourage efficient use of the available resources and technology has become the most viable strategy.","Adiukwu, de Filippis, Orsolini, Gashi BytyÃƒÂ§i, Shoib, Ransing, Slaih, Jaguga, Handuleh, Ojeahere, Ullah, Karaliuniene, Nagendrappa, Vahdani, Ashrafi, Ori, NoÃƒÂ«l, Abbass, Jatchavala, Pinto da Costa, Essam, Vadivel, Shalbafan","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000774","20210708","Task shifting; mental health care equity; mental health gap; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15809,""
"Physical relaxation for occupational stress in healthcare workers: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Work related stress is a major occupational health problem that is associated with adverse effects on physical and mental health. Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable in the era of COVID-19. Physical methods of stress relief such as yoga and massage therapy may reduce occupational stress. The objective of this systematic review and network meta-analysis is to determine the effects of yoga, massage therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, and stretching on alleviating stress and improving physical and mental health in healthcare workers. Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on the use of physical relaxation methods for occupational stress in healthcare workers with any duration of follow-up. Meta-analysis was performed for standard mean differences in stress measures from baseline between subjects undergoing relaxation vs non-intervention controls. Network meta-analysis was conducted to determine the best relaxation method. Fifteen trials representing 688 healthcare workers were identified. Random-effects meta-analysis shows that physical relaxation methods overall reduced measures of occupational stress at the longest duration of follow-up vs baseline compared to non-intervention controls (SMD -0.53; 95% CI [-0.74 to -0.33]; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .00001). On network meta-analysis, only yoga alone (SMD -0.71; 95% CI [-1.01 to -0.41]) and massage therapy alone (SMD -0.43; 95% CI [-0.72 to -0.14]) were more effective than control, with yoga identified as the best method (p-scoreÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .89). Physical relaxation may help reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers. Yoga is particularly effective and offers the convenience of online delivery. Employers should consider implementing these methods into workplace wellness programs.","Zhang, Murphy, Cabanilla, Yidi","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12243","20210708","burnout; healthcare workers; occupational medicine; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15810,""
"What makes Dutch youth comply with preventive COVID-19 measures? An explorative study","The measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 are challenging for youth, especially the social isolation measures. These measures are antagonistic to healthy youth development, which requires sufficient social contact with peers and adults. This explorative study examined what factors are associated with adherence to COVID-19 measures in a sample of Dutch youth (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°263; 79.8% female) with ages ranging between 16 and 24 years (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21.1 years; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.44 years), who completed an online questionnaire about their compliance to measures, resilience, coping strategies, mental health, and availability of a natural mentor. Results showed that youth with fewer depressive symptoms adhered better to measures of social distance. Youth who were less suspicious, more resilient, and those with an active coping strategy or a natural mentor more often complied with COVID-19 measures. These results can be used to help youth comply with the COVID-19 measures.","Koning, Hagedoorn, Stams, Assink, van Dam","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22651","20210708","Covid-19; coping; mental health; natural mentoring; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15811,""
"Depressive Symptoms Among Adolescents: Testing Vulnerability-Stress and Protective Models in the Context of COVID-19","Adolescents who experience negative life events may be at risk for depression, particularly those with psychosocial vulnerabilities. We investigate longitudinally the impact of vulnerability/protective factors on the relation between a large-scale negative life event, the COVID-19 pandemic, and depressive symptoms. Adolescents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°228, M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.5Ã‚Â years, 53% female, 73% white) self-reported depressive symptoms 2-4Ã‚Â months before the pandemic (Time 1), and again 2Ã‚Â months following stay-at-home orders (Time 2). At T2, adolescents also completed measures of vulnerability, protective factors, and COVID-19-related distress. Depressive symptoms increased at T2, and COVID-19 distress interacted with resilience and negative cognitive style in predicting increases in T2 depression. Focusing on vulnerability and protective factors in adolescents distressed by large scale negative life events appears crucial.","Gladstone, Schwartz, PÃƒÂ¶ssel, Richer, Buchholz, Rintell","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01216-4","20210708","Adolescent; COVID-19; Cognitive styles; Depression; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15812,""
"COVID-19 and Psychosocial Support Services: Experiences of People Living with Enduring Mental Health Conditions","This paper uses secondary analysis to understand how COVID-19 shaped people's experiences with psychosocial support services in Australia. Data are drawn from questionnaires (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°66) and semi-structured interviews (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°62), conducted for a national service evaluation, with 121 people living with enduring mental health conditions and using psychosocial support services. Data relating to COVID-19 were inductively coded and analysed using constant comparative analysis. Most people's experiences included tele-support. While some people described minimal disruption to their support, many reported reduced engagement. People's wellbeing and engagement were influenced by: their location, living situation and pre-COVID lifestyles; physical health conditions; access to, comfort with, and support worker facilitation of technology; pre-COVID relationships with support workers; and communication from the organisation. The findings can help services prepare for future pandemics, adjust their services for a 'COVID-normal' world, and consider how learnings from COVID-19 could be incorporated into a flexible suite of service delivery options.","Honey, Waks, Hines, Glover, Hancock, Hamilton, Smith-Merry","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-021-00871-0","20210708","COVID-19; Community mental health support; Lived experience perspectives; Mental health; Psychosocial support program","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15813,""

As medical students are already vulnerable to poor psychological well-being, the mental health of medical students may be significantly affected by the changes caused by COVID-19. <b>Objective</b>: In this article, we discuss the curriculum and mental health ramifications of the COVID-19 epidemic on the international medical school population <b>Methods</b>: In this review, we analyzed 13 studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on medical school curriculum, medical student mental health, and subsequent medical student coping strategies. <b>Results</b>: Early in the COVID-19 outbreak, the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended to pause all student clinical rotations, while in-person curriculum moved to virtual modalities. Students expressed concern over their abilities to explore specialties of interest and their confidence in becoming a competent doctor. Medical students also reported higher levels of anxiety, stress, and exhaustion, with female students reporting this more than male students.

"Did the UK COVID-19 Lockdown Modify the Influence of Neighbourhood Disorder on Psychological Distress? Evidence From a Prospective Cohort Study","<b>Background:</b> National lockdown in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the mobility of residents and increased time spent in their residential neighbourhoods. This is a unique opportunity to understand how an exogenous factor that reduces mobility may influence the association between neighbourhood social environment and mental health. This study investigates whether the COVID-19 lockdown may modify the effect of neighbourhood disorder on psychological distress. <b>Methods:</b> We tracked changes in psychological distress, using the UK household longitudinal survey across the pre-COVID and lockdown periods in 16,535 adults. Neighbourhood disorder was measured along two subscales: social stressors and property crime. Fixed-effects regression was used to evaluate whether the widespread reduction in mobility modifies the association between the subscales of neighbourhood disorder and psychological distress. <b>Results:</b> The effect of neighbourhood social stressors on psychological distress was stronger in the lockdown period compared to the pre-COVID period. Compared to the pre-COVID period, the effect of being in neighbourhoods with the highest social stressors (compared to the lowest) on psychological distress increased by 20% during the lockdown. Meanwhile, the effect of neighbourhood property crime on mental health did not change during the lockdown. <b>Conclusion:</b> The sudden loss of mobility as a result of COVID-19 lockdown is a unique opportunity to address the endogeneity problem as it relates to mobility and locational preferences in the study of neighbourhood effects on health. Vulnerable groups who have limited mobility are likely more sensitive to neighbourhood social stressors compared to the general population.","Teo, Kim, Nielsen, Young, O'Campo, Chum","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.702807","20210708","COVID-19; exogeneity; longitudinal study; mental health; mobility; neighbourhood disorder; public health; residential environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15815,""
"A Comparative Study on the Psychological Health of Frontline Health Workers in Wuhan Under and After the Lockdown","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and a 3-month lockdown of Wuhan may have had a long-term impact on the mental health of frontline healthcare workers (HWs). However, there is still a lack of comparative studies on the mental health of front-line HWs in the initial phase of the lockdown and 1 month after the lifting of the lockdown. <b>Methods:</b> We recruited 1717 HWs during the initial phase of the lockdown and 2214 HWs 1 month after the lifting of the lockdown, and their baseline characteristics and psychiatric health in these two phases were compared. Furthermore, Pearson's Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the possible risk factors associated with depressive symptoms in the front-line HWs. <b>Results:</b> Compared with the initial phase of the lockdown, the proportion of HWs with anxiety symptoms and stress decreased, while the proportion of HWs with depressive symptoms increased a month after the lifting of the lockdown. Male sex, exercise habit, comorbidities, and having family members or relatives with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were significantly related to the increased incidence of depressive symptoms during the initial phase of the lockdown. Comorbidities, negative effect of media coverage, working &gt;4 days a week, lower annual household income, and deteriorating relationships with family members were associated with depressive symptoms a month after the lifting of the lockdown. <b>Conclusion:</b> The increased proportion of HWs with depressive symptoms 1 month after the lifting of the lockdown suggested that mental health of front-line HWs should be a top-priority issue, not only during, but also after the pandemic.","Qiu, Lan, Miao, Wang, Wang, Wu, Li, Zhao, Cao, Mei, Sun, Zhu, Zhu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.701032","20210708","COVID-19; anxiety symptoms; depressive symptoms; front-line healthcare workers; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","",15816,""
"Psychosocial Aspects During the First Wave of COVID-19 Infection in South Africa","<b>Background:</b> In South Africa, as in many countries, the nationwide spread of COVID-19 caused a public health emergency that resulted in the government implementing necessary restrictive measures such as the nationwide lockdown as a way of containing the pandemic. Such restrictive measure, while necessary, can disrupt many aspects of people's lives resulting in unprecedented psychosocial distress. <b>Aim:</b> The present study aims to describe the psychosocial health and situational factors associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in South Africa during the first wave of infection. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional survey, recruited a total of 203 participants through convenience sampling via online platforms-WhatsApp, Facebook, emails, etc.-during COVID-19 lockdown in the country. Through the snowball technique, participants from across South Africa completed the online survey that assessed socio-demographic information, risk perception, history of mental health, COVID-19-related stress, and fears during the lockdown (first wave). <b>Results:</b> The majority of the participants who completed the survey were young, Black African, and female. Participants reported feelings of stress and anxiety (61.2%); stress about finances (39.5%); and feelings of sadness, anger, and/or frustration (31.6%) during the lockdown.
