"The effect of potential factors on all-cause and cause-specific and mortality: a pre-COVID-19 period review","BackgroundAbout 3 million people die every year in USA. In order to provide a general direction and background for subsequent research and development in this field, we reviewed the studies about impact of potential factors associated with the main causes of mortality and all-cause mortality.

MethodResearches are selected by PubMed website for last 15 years with published language of English. The leading cause of death were published by CDC in 2020 (excluded COVID-19) including the ten natural mortalities and unnatural mortality. We summarized the potential factors associated with the mortality and sorted them by ""positive/negative effect"" and ""long-term/short-term effect"".

ResultAmong risk factors, the factors of depression, unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity and other similar factors increase the mortality of main leading natural causes. Among protective factors, the factors of physical activity, nut intake, chocolate consumption were associated with the reduced mortality of multiple diseases. We also found that some factors possess bidirectional influence on different diseases or even one disease. The gender of female negatively affects mortality of diabetes, but positively affects cardiovascular diseases. The majority of air pollutants are risk factors for respiratory diseases while ozone possibly reduce the mortality.

ConclusionOur review summarized various factors which have positive/negative and long-term/short-term effects on the main mortality of cause-specific and all-caused mortality. Further study is required to investigate the contribution of different variable on mortality.","Jia Xu; Yunkai Lin; JianYu Tong; Ying Zhou","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.08.22276123","20220608","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32613,""
"Psychological Reactions of Turkish Healthcare Workers During Covid-19 Outbreak: The Impact of Stigmatization","Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has resulted in huge psychological distress, especially for people working under risky conditions, such as healthcare workers. We aimed to investigate the psychological challenges of Turkish healthcare workers during the outbreak and discuss the factors that increase their burden, including stigmatization. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey composed of sociodemographic data, questions about perceived stigma, and concerns about working conditions was completed. Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was also used. Results: 634 participants completed the survey and the prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress-related symptoms were 36%, 35%, and 22%, respectively. Being female, working with close contact with patients with COVID-19 and having a psychiatric disorder history were risk factors for psychological distress. The healthcare workers with significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores described having less amount of personal protective equipment, lower support from their supervisors, and more unsafe working conditions. Additionally, 7% of the participants stated that they perceived stigmatization by their families and close friends, 14% perceived stigmatization by their neighbours, relatives, and less intimate friends;and 7% perceived stigmatization by unfamiliar people. Healthcare workers who perceived other people as more dismissive had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores. Conclusion: Our study shows that healthcare workers are at risk of developing psychological disturbances during infectious outbreaks. To minimize the psychological impact, additional risk factors such as having a previous psychiatric disorder, working under unsafe conditions, and stigmatization should be taken into account and a more supportive and safer environment should be provided.

"Depression and Anxiety Disorders in COVID-19 Survivors: Role of Inflammatory Predictors","Introduction: Infection-triggered perturbation of the immune system, which was observed after previous coronavirus outbreaks, could induce psychiatric sequelae. The spreading of the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between inflammatory biomarkers and the levels of depression and anxiety in patients who recovered from COVID-19. Methods: We screened 109 COVID-19 survivor adults for psychiatric symptoms on the 15th day of follow-up after discharge from the hospital. The patients were split into two groups, the ones with depression and anxiety, and the ones without depression or anxiety, after the psychiatric interview. Self-rating Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were applied to assess the levels in patients with depression and anxiety. We collected and recorded the sociodemographic information, clinical data, and baseline inflammatory markers. Results: Higher baseline neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were found in patients with depression and anxiety. Higher levels of depression and anxiety were found in younger and female patients. Besides, a significant correlation was found between BAI and ferritin levels in patients with anxiety, while no association was found between BAI and other inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover, no significant relationship was found between BDI scores and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with depression. Conclusion: COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Nonetheless, psychiatric involvement is not uncommon and can lead to severe problems if not detected and managed at an early stage. It is recommended that clinicians should be vigilant in terms of psychiatric involvement in COVID-19 patients presenting with high inflammatory parameters.

"Reflections on transition - in medical practice not only during a pandemic with reference to selected texts from the literature","Medical practice in various medical disciplines, especially in family medicine, in the time of a pandemic, indicates that in medical interviews patients not only talk about the ailments they report, but also report fear of death and passing away. Indeed, a special, individual approach to each patient is recommended, also in these matters, which is also important in the promotion of mental health. There are statements from patients that the more they know in the media about the successive waves of COVID-19 infections, the more often thoughts about death and passing related to fear for the future of themselves, their family and loved ones appear. Some patients even say: ""what will happen to this world"", what awaits humanity. According to psychologists, it is natural to react to a direct threat to life. It is worth analyzing the issue of the human approach to the phenomenon of passing away in an interdisciplinary context in the context of health sciences, medicine, but also the humanities, such as the history of medicine or the philosophy of medicine, as well as literature and art in general.","Jarzabek-Bielecka, G.; Luwanski, D.; Jarzabek, A.; Bielecki, M.; Plagens-Rotman, K.; Warchol, E.; Mizgier, M.","https://doi.org/10.25121/MR.2021.24.3-4.30","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medycyna Rodzinna; 3(4):30-32, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32618,""

"Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol EMDR Applied Online for COVID-19-Related Symptoms of Turkish Health Care Workers Diagnosed with COVID-19-Related PTSD: A Pilot Study","Background: This study investigates the effect of the online Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol on posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and burnout symptoms in healthcare workers diagnosed with pandemic- related post-traumatic stress disorder. Methods: The study included healthcare workers who applied to psychiatry outpatient clinics due to the psychiatric symptoms that developed related to the pandemic and who were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The Beck Anxiety Inventory, Impact of Event Scale-Revised to evaluate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal), Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory were used for the assessment. The tests were administered 3 times (pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 1-month follow-up). Results: This study included 14 healthcare workers diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder;2 (14.3%) physicians, 2 (14.3%) nurses, 4 (28.6%) other-healthcare workers/medical staff, and 6 (42.8%) other healthcare workers/non-medical staff. There was a significant decrease in Impact of Event Scale-Revised total score, the intrusion and hyper-arousal sub-scores between T1 and T2 (P = .018;P = .005;P = .0005, respectively) and between T1 and T3 (P &lt; .001;P &lt; .001;P &lt; .001, respectively), but there was no difference between T2 and T3 (P = .89). A significant difference was found in repeated measurements of both Beck Depression Inventory [P &lt; .001] and Beck Anxiety Inventory [P &lt; .001] scores. There was a significant difference in emotional exhaustion, one of the subscales of Maslach Burnout Inventory (P = .09). However, there was no significant difference in depersonalization (P = .48) and personal accomplishment (P = .66). Conclusions: Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol appears to be capable of reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, intrusion, and hyperarousal symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and emotional exhaustion when symptoms that developed are related to the pandemic in healthcare workers.

"Impact of COVID-19 on people with Down syndrome in Japan based on regional differences frequency of emergency declarations","Purpose&gt;The purpose of this study was to clarify the impact of adults with Down syndrome (DS) on COVID-19 and the status of efforts for new normal in Japan through a Web survey.Design/methodology/approach&gt;Parentsâ€™ associationsâ€™ representatives sent requests to members aged 18 years or older inviting them to participate in an Internet survey. A total of 141 people cooperated, and 126 people were included in the analysis.Findings&gt;As a result of examining the number of times the state of emergency was declared and its impact on COVID-19, the degree of anxiety felt when hearing information about new coronavirus infections on television or the internet was significantly higher in subjects for whom the state of emergency was declared four times than in subjects for whom the state of emergency was declared two and three times in the region. This was significantly higher than that of the subjects in the areas where the state of emergency had been declared four times and significantly lower than that of the subjects in the areas where the state of emergency had been declared one time for â€œsmilingâ€. The results suggest that the effects on physical and mental health, although limited, are influenced by the number of times the state of emergency was declared.

"The impact and management SARS-CoV-2 in a psychiatric hospital setting","BACKGROUND: During the months of August and September 2020, an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 took root in Mount Carmel Hospital and affected 29 elderly female chronic psychiatric inpatients, representing a significant clinical undertaking within the context of this low-resource healthcare setting. METHODS: An emergency isolation ward was set up to contend with the outbreak, while a medical response team comprised of two psychiatric doctors and five extended foundation trainees was established in order to care for this vulnerable patient cohort. Close liaison with the Infectious Diseases team at Mater Dei Hospital fostered an effective therapeutic setting within which these patients could be treated. This represented a unique approach in an environment where literature on SARS-CoV-2 is scarce - the psychiatric inpatient setting. RESULTS: All 29 of our patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 during the course of this period as a result of close clinical observation, a system of twice-daily patient review, early identification of patient deterioration and effective cross-speciality communication. CONCLUSION: An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 within the mental health inpatient setting represents a number of unique clinical, managerial and interpersonal challenges, though straightforward clinical measures and effective patient monitoring can greatly aid the response to viral outbreaks in low-resource healthcare settings.","Warwicker, S.; Piscopo, N.; Duca, K.; Baldacchino, G.; Camilleri, J.; Caruana, L.; Grech, A.; Mamo, D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+and+management+SARS-CoV-2+in+a+psychiatric+hospital+setting","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Malta Medical Journal; 34(2):39-50, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32630,""
"Sports and Physical Activity Attenuate the Emotional Toll of the Covid-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the alterations or restrictions of youth sports and physical activity. These changes may have had negative ramifications on anxiety and both physical and psychological readiness to return to sport in youth athletes. Hypothesis/Purpose: Our purpose was to investigate the relationships between the physical and mental health ramifications on youth athletes during restricted sport activities that resulted from COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Our hypothesis was that youth athletes who participated in a similar or greater volume of organized sports would have less anxiety during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders compared with those who reported a decrease in organized sport volume. Methods: Our cross-sectional study evaluated male and female athletes who competed in club sports (e.g., non-school sponsored) at the time of questionnaire completion. All participants completed an online questionnaire between July 15, 2020 and August 10, 2020. We asked participants to report the average hours/week they spent in organized sports or physical activity unrelated to their sport prior to COVID-19 and currently. We grouped participants on whether they had a decrease or increase/no change in their reported activity level. Participants also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire. Results: A total of 192 participants (13.0Â±2.2 years of age;range= 6-18 years, 56% female) completed the study. On average, participants reported 2.3 (SD+5.2) fewer hours of sport training per week during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders compared to prior. Over half (56%) of participants reported a decreased training volume during stay-at-home orders, and 44% reported a similar or increased training volume (Table 1). The respondents reporting decreased training volumes had significantly greater anxiety scores than those who reported similar training volumes (Figure 1). After adjusting for the potential confounders of age, sex, and body size, decreased training volumes during stay-at-home orders were significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (ÃŸ coefficient = 2.02;95% confidence interval = 0.64, 3.41;p = 0.005). Those with decreased training volumes were more likely to report feeling undertrained (72% vs 30%, p&lt;0.001) and less physically ready to return to sport (56% vs 88%, p&lt;0.001) compared to those with similar/increased training volumes (Table 1). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in decreased training volumes and higher anxiety scores (mean difference= 1.9 GAD-7 points, 95% confidence interval= 0.6, 3.2) compared with athletes who reported similar/increased training volumes. Lastly, those in the decreased training cohort felt both under-trained and less physically ready to return to sports.Table 1.

"Applicability of a national strategy for patient-oriented research to people who use(d) substances: a Canadian experience","Background Europe and North America are in the grips of a devastating overdose crisis. People who use substances often feel unsafe to access healthcare due to fears of stigma, blame, judgement, poor treatment, or other repercussions. As a result, they often avoid, delay, or leave care, resulting in premature death and missed opportunities for care. Internationally, there have been concerted efforts to move towards patient-engaged research to enhance the quality of health care systems and services. In Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) initiative promotes engagement of patients as active partners in health care research. As part of a community based patient oriented research project, we critically analyze the SPOR framework to provide insights into what constitutes safer research with people who use(d) substances. Methods We undertook a two-stage process that began with a review of community based research principles and the SPOR framework. At the second stage, we undertook a qualitative descriptive study employing focus groups to generate description of the adequacy and appropriateness of the SPOR framework for guiding research with people who use(d) substances on four key dimensions (patient engagement, guiding principles, core areas of engagement and benefits). The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis to identify key issues and insights. Results While the SPOR framework includes aÂ range of patient roles, principles and areas for engagement, there are issues andÂ gaps related to essential elements of safe patient-oriented research for people who use substances. These include an individualized focus on patients as partners, lack of recognition of community benefits, power imbalances and distrust due to systemic stigma, engagement as one way capacity building and learning, and lack of accountability for taking action on research findings. Conclusions Given the extent of stigma in health care and the ongoing illicit drug policy crisis, strategies for enhancing equitable Patient-Oriented Research (POR) include shifting language from patient partners to community researchers, recognizing power inequities and adding trust and equity as core POR principles including pay equity. Employing community based participatory research as a POR methodology allows the lead researchers to fully engage community throughout the research process, enhances community benefits and accountability for action. Plain English Summary In Canada, one of the lessons being learned as we navigate the current dual public health crises (COVID-19 pandemic and illicit drug overdoses and deaths) is the extent to which substance use and access to services is highly stigmatized, especially when combined with poverty, homelessness and perpetuated by racism and other forms of discrimination. Stigma and lack of feeling safe in health care can result in avoidance, delays or leaving care early, resulting in premature death and lack of essential care. Internationally, there has been a push to improve health services by involving patients as active partners in the research process. Termed â€œpatient-oriented researchâ€ (POR), Canadaâ€™s primary federal funding agency for health research (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR) created the Strategy for Patient-Oriented (SPOR) Initiative to guide and support researchers involved in POR projects. As part of a POR project, our research team examined the SPOR Framework to determine its value in guiding research with people who use substances. Our team included people with lived and living experiences of substance use, academic researchers, health service providers, and decision makers. Five focus groups were held to review the SPOR Patient Engagement Framework and discuss strategies for successful POR. We found numerous gaps related to important elements of POR with people who use substances including the need to move away from â€˜us and themâ€™ on research teams and shifting away from ind viduals to communities, build trust, explicitly attend to power inequities between research partners, and acting on findings. These insights provide recommendations for more equitable POR research with people who use substances.","Pauly, Bernadette, Sullivan, Ginger, Inglis, Dakota, Cameron, Fred, Phillips, Jack, Rosen, Conor, Bullock, Bill, Cartwright, Jennifer, Hainstock, Taylor, Trytten, Cindy, Urbanoski, Karen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Applicability+of+a+national+strategy+for+patient-oriented+research+to+people+who+use(d)+substances:+a+Canadian+experience","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research involvement and engagement; 8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32634,""

"The Impact of sport particiaption on the Health of Adolescents During the CoVID-19 pandemic","Background: Since April 2020, some high schools were closed to in-person teaching, and interscholastic and club sports were cancelled in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. While some US adolescents participated in sports since April 2020, other US adolescents did not participate in sports during this time. It is unknown what effect sport participation has had on the health of adolescents. Hypothesis/Purpose: To identify how sport participation during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the health of adolescents. Methods: Adolescents across the US were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in the spring of 2021. Participants were asked to report their demographics (age, gender, race), whether they participated in school club or school sports since May 2020, type of school they attended (in-person, online, hybrid), and measures of mental health (MH), physical activity (PA) and quality of life (QoL). Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Assessment scores were compared for respondents who participated in sports (PAR) with those that did not participate in sports (NoPAR). Univariable comparisons between the groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests while means for continuous outcome measures were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for age, gender, race and the type of school attendance. Results: 4,693 adolescents (52% female, Age = 16.1+1.3 yrs., grades 9â€“12) from 38 states participated in the study with PAR = 4,286 (91%) and NoPAR = 407 (9%). NoPAR participants reported a higher prevalence of moderate to severe levels of anxiety (29.3% vs 21.3%, p&lt;0.001) and depression (40.7% vs 19.8%, p&lt;0.001). NoPAR participants reported lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean 13.2 [95%CI 12.4, 13.9] vs 21.2 [20.7, 21.6] p&lt;0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to the PAR group (77.9 [76.5, 79.3] vs. 83.2 [82.3, 84.1], p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Adolescents who did not play a sport during the COVID-19 pandemic reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression, as well as lower physical activity and quality of life scores compared to adolescents who did play a school or club sport. Participation in organized sports may offer an important opportunity to improve physical activity and mental health for adolescents during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","McGuine, Timothy, Biese, Kevin, Schwarz, Alison, Dickman, James, Hetzel, Scott, Reardon, Claudia, Watson, Andrew","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+sport+particiaption+on+the+Health+of+Adolescents+During+the+CoVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine; 10(5 suppl2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32636,""
"Coping resources mediate the prospective associations between disrupted daily routines and persistent psychiatric symptoms: A population-based cohort study","This study examined the mediating effects of coping resources in the prospective associations between daily routine disruptions in the acute phase of COVID-19 and persistent probable anxiety and depression. A prospective, population-representative cohort of 1318 Hong Kong Chinese respondents completed a baseline survey between February and July 2020 (T1) and a 1-year follow-up survey between March and August 2021 (T2). Respondents reported demographics and disruptions to primary and secondary daily routines at T1, coping resources (i.e., self-efficacy and meaning making) at T2, and anxiety and depressive symptoms at T1 and T2. We found that 8.1% and 10.0% of respondents reached cutoff scores for probable anxiety and depression respectively at both T1 and T2. Logistic regression showed that T1 daily routine disruptions were positively associated with heightened risk of persistent probable anxiety and depression amid COVID-19. Path analysis showed that 15.3% and 13.1% of the associations of daily routine disruptions with persistent probable anxiety and depression were explained by coping resources, respectively, while the direct routine-outcome associations remained significant. Daily routine disruptions predict higher odds of persistent probable anxiety and depression directly and partially through reducing coping resources. Sustainment of regular daily routines should be advocated and fostered to enhance coping resources and reduce the risk of poorer adjustment among the affected populations amid public health crises.","Li, Tsz Wai, Liang, Li, Ho, Po Lam, Fung Yeung, Ernest Tsun, Hobfoll, Stevan E.; Hou, Wai Kai","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coping+resources+mediate+the+prospective+associations+between+disrupted+daily+routines+and+persistent+psychiatric+symptoms:+A+population-based+cohort+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of psychiatric research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32637,""
"OPTIMISM HIDDEN IN PANDORA'S BOX: THE ROLE OF THREE TYPES OF EXPECTANCIES (OPTIMISM, HOPE AND SELF-EFFICACY) IN WELL-BEING AND ANXIETY DURING THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Objectives. Although various mental health-related consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been documented, there has been far less attention given to potential protective factors. Questions and hypotheses. In the present study, authors examined the role of three types of positive expectancies - optimism, hope, and self-efficacy - as predictors of well-being and anxiety. Furthermore, authors examined the role of coping strategies as a potential mediator between expectancies and criterion variables. Sample and settings. The present study was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak in Slovakia after a national emergency was declared (N=1011). Additionally, longitudinal follow up was conducted after a national lockdown (N=391). Statistical analysis. Multi-model linear regression (the Bayesian approach) and simple mediation analysis (the Frequentist approach) were used to answer research questions. Results. In the main study with N=1011 participants sampled after a national emergency was declared, the role of optimism in predicting anxiety and well-being was corroborated. Moreover, this finding was replicated after a national lockdown and the degree to which Coronavirus was considered dangerous served as a potential mediator. Besides optimism, self-efficacy negatively predicted anxiety, and subscales of hope predicted well-being. Additionally, the role of coping strategies as potential mediator was examined. In follow up with N=391 respondents who decided to participate after the national lockdown, authors found an indirect effect of optimism on well-being and anxiety through dysfunctional coping. Limitations. The present study has some limitations that should be reflected upon. For example, convenience sampling was used. Moreover, interpretations related to causality should be avoided and the specificity of the effect in relation to pandemic situation should be further examined in future research.","KacmÃ¡r, Pavol, HricovÃ¡, Monika, SchrÃ¶tter, Jana, BavolÃ¡r, Jozef","https://www.google.com/search?q=OPTIMISM+HIDDEN+IN+PANDORA'S+BOX:+THE+ROLE+OF+THREE+TYPES+OF+EXPECTANCIES+(OPTIMISM,+HOPE+AND+SELF-EFFICACY)+IN+WELL-BEING+AND+ANXIETY+DURING+THE+OUTBREAK+OF+COVID-19+PANDEMIC","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ceskoslovenska Psychologie; 66(2):78-94, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32638,""
"Pandemic Consequences upon College Freshmen's Lives in the Context of Online Education","[...]within the domain of education we could distinguish an expression of this inequality between courses that could be easily moved into the online environment, like mathematics, philosophy, economy, etc. and those which couldn't be due to their more practical handson approach, like medicine, arts, physical education and sport, etc. By being deprived of human interaction, future specialists not only lost due the pandemic practical experience, but their personal development had also been affected. 2.Theoretical foundation Transition from high school to college can be a stressful period for most of the students, especially if they come from troublesome families (Fei et al., 2021;Moreira & Telzer, 2015;Bernier et al., 2005). Mental health problems represent a major issue among college freshmen's (Bruffaerts et al., 2018), as well as homesick (English et al., 2017), increased alcohol and tobacco use (LaBrie et al., 2007;Lenz, 2004) or physical activity decrease (Downes, 2015), all which could have favored the surfacing of the ""Freshmen 15"" concept (Baum, 2017;Mihalopoulos et al., 2008).

"The Efficacy of a Mental Skills Training Course for Collegiate Athletes","Background: Psychological skills training has been shown to improve performance in athletes. However, few studies have looked at the efficacy of mental skills training programs in young athletes. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate satisfaction of collegiate athletes with a 6-session mental skills course, and to assess changes in mental toughness and coping skills before and after the course. Methods: We conducted a 6-session mental skills training program with Division I female collegiate athletes during the fall of 2020. Athletes completed pre-course, post-course, and 4-month questionnaires to assess efficacy of the course, as well as their satisfaction. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, none of the athletes were actively competing at the time of the course or during follow-up surveys. Demographic information was collected and the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory (ACSI, range=0-84) and Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI, range=8-56) were used to assess coping skills and mental toughness at all time points. Satisfaction was assessed on a ten-point scale, with 10 being most satisfied. Results: Fifty-four Division I female athletes participated in the program. Mean age was 19.8 years, 61% reported training in their sport for 8 or more months a year, 26% reported history of mental health conditions, and 22% reported being injured or recovering from injury at the time of participation. For participants with paired pre- and post-course data (n=37, 68.5%), MTI scores improved by a mean 2.6 points (95% CI=1.1-4.1;p=0.001) and ASCI scores improved by a mean 4.0 points (95% CI=0.6-7.4;p=0.02) from pre- to post-course. For participants with paired data for pre-course and four-month follow-up (n=25, 46.2%), no change was detected in mean MTI score (p=0.72). There was, however, a mean increase of 3.4 points in mean ASCI from pre-course to four-month follow-up (95% CI=0.4-6.4;p=0.03). Overall satisfaction had a median score of 9/10 at the post-course assessment, and eighteen participants (18/37, 48.6%) shared positive free-text comments regarding course delivery, content, and impact. No negative feedback was reported. Conclusion: Following a 6-session mental skills course in collegiate female athletes, mental toughness and coping skills scores significantly improved at post-course assessment.

"Study of Relationship between Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 lockdown and Resilience among Physiotherapists","Background â€¢ Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and lockdown has caused negative impact on mental health status of health care workers including the physiotherapists as physiotherapists are also involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 infection. â€¢ Taking care of COVID-19 infected patients can be exhaustive both physically and mentally due to involved risk of contracting the disease which may prove fatal for some. â€¢ Due to ongoing lockdown many physiotherapists are not able to work either fully or partially as per their potential. So, physiotherapists like other health care workers are not immune to mental health impacts of COVID-19 lockdown. Aim â€¢ To assess relationship between psychological impact of COVID-19 in the form of anxiety and depression, and the resilience among physiotherapists. Methods â€¢ Data were collected from total 378 physiotherapists. â€¢ Beckâ€™s depression inventory (BDI), generalized anxiety disorder 7 item (GAD-7) scale, and brief resilience scale (BRS) were used to assess depression, anxiety, and resilience respectively among the study participants. â€¢ Data were analyzed by using SPSS 15 and, Chi-sqaure, Fisher exact, and Personâ€™s correlation tests. Results â€¢ Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 37.8% and 31% respectively. â€¢ As regards the resilience, 2.9% had high, 74.3% had normal, and 22.8% had low resilience levels. â€¢ Physiotherapists who had high level of resilience had lower rates of anxiety on GAD-7 and lower rates of depression on BDI. Conclusion â€¢ Strengthening the resilience of physiotherapists can promote their mental health in longer run in face of stressful event like COVID-19 lockdown. â€¢ So, resilience strengthening programs must be the priority.","Ghogare*, Ajinkya Sureshrao, Wasudeorao Bele, Ashish, Sinha, Rakesh Kumar, Sinha, Saumi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Study+of+Relationship+between+Mental+Health+Impact+of+COVID-19+lockdown+and+Resilience+among+Physiotherapists","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S694-S694, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32641,""

"Preventing Prison Staff Assaults","Doolin and Gooch discuss the need to prevent prison staff assaults. A recent survey of nearly 600 prison officers in the UK found that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to elevated levels of anxiety and 'burnout', and a deterioration of physical and mental health. The Prison Officers Association has also expressed growing concern regarding increased prison violence and disorder over the last decade. Although the increase in the maximum penalties for assaulting prison officers - and their inclusion within the legislation regarding emergency workers - might be viewed as a welcome development, the extent to which it will serve a deterrent effect and reduce the incidence of staff assault is relatively limited. Reducing and preventing staff assaults requires an environment where prisoners are safe and an investment in strong prisoner-staff relationships and staff-manager relationships.","Doolin, Katherine, Gooch, Kate","https://www.google.com/search?q=Preventing+Prison+Staff+Assaults","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Prison Service Journal; - (260):14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32643,""
"The association between distance learning and occurrence of depression and anxiety: a cross-sectional study among male and female medical students at Umm Al-Qura University","The study objective was to explore the association between distance learning and depression and anxiety among medical students at umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the relationship between distance learning and depression and anxiety. A questionnaire was used at Umm Al-Qura University targeting 302 volunteers from medical students to collect the data. Students who were anxious or depressed for other causes were not included. The data was analyzed by Chi-square test. Number of students who had anxiety and/or depression due to distance learning was low (p &gt; 0.05) compared to other groups without anxiety and/or depression. 175 (56.2%) students stated that they had this feeling before applying distance learning. It was found highly significant with gender comparison (p-value: 0.008). Out of 65 respondents aged 19-20, 51 (78.5%) indicated distance learning as a strong predictor of reduced GPA in this age group (p-value: 0.01). Distance learning was a significant predictor of lower GPAs among students in this academic year. The students of age group (21-22) were the most affected group having feeling that they got affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 243, (77.9%) of participants were females, 151 (48.4%) of them said COVID-19 impacted their ability to learn/study, whereas a total of 59 (18.9%) participants were from the second academic year. 48(15.4%) of them said that COVID-19 impacted their ability to learn/study. It is noticed that the age group (19-20) in the second year was the most affected according to age and academic year. While distant education has little to no effect on students' mental health, there were enough number of students who attributed their depression and anxiety to distance education. However, the important factors that might have influenced the results are a lack of medical study experience, a lack of understanding of distance learning, and a lack of an appropriate learning environment.","Ahmad Hasan, Mufti, Deema Sami, Ashoor, Khulud Ayman, Boubsit, Elaf Rudda, Altalhi, Baydaa Safar, Aljunaid, Jannat Abdullah, Abdulmuttalib, Raneem Raja, Althebeti","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+association+between+distance+learning+and+occurrence+of+depression+and+anxiety:+a+cross-sectional+study+among+male+and+female+medical+students+at+Umm+Al-Qura+University","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology; 19(2):275-281, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32644,""
"A Study to evaluate depression, anxiety and stress among medical interns during COVID crisis","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in Wuhan, China, commonly presents as a severe acute respiratory disease referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).The pandemic had a great impact on mental health of health care worker especially medical interns who were prematurely exposed to such nightmarish experience. To evaluate level of stress, depression and anxiety on medical interns a cross sectional observational study was performed .Assessment of mental status of interns was of prime importance because they are going to lead countriesâ€™ health care system in upcoming times. METHOD A cross-sectional observational study conducted between may 2021 to June 2021. Participants were medical interns posted in COVID-19 wards. They were invited to participate using whatsapp application. Link was sent to 250 students out of which 210 choose to submit completely filled form. A 21 items self rated scale DASS was used to evaluate depression, anxiety disorder and stress. RESULTS 210 interns participated in study out which 40 % (n=84) were females and 60% (n=126) were males. The mean depression score on DASS scale was 11.19(S.D=7.18) , mean anxiety score was 13.79(S.D=4.46) and mean score of stress was 15.95(S.D 3.53). There was no statistically significant difference in depressive, anxiety, stresses related symptoms. CONCLUSION There was negative effect on mental health of interns posted in COVID-19 wards with stress being more prevalent than anxiety followed by depressive symptoms however it was much lower than interns from other countries.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Study+to+evaluate+depression,+anxiety+and+stress+among+medical+interns+during+COVID+crisis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S574-S574, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32645,""

"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD) in Heath Care workers (HCWs) during Covid Pandemic- Case series","&gt;Aims and objective: To present a series of 4 cases of PTSD in HCWs during the covid second wave Methodology: Reporting 4 different cases of PTSD in healthcare workers. 02 medical officers, 01 Nurse, and 01 health assistant who reported symptoms of vague nature arising out of stress during handling of Covid 19 pts and on detailed evaluation , had classical features of ICD 10 diagnosis of PTSD. All of them had clear cut psychological symptoms arising in close temporal relation to experiencing the trauma of handling covid patients and the agony and disaster that befell us during the covid second wave from April to Aug 2021. None of them had any past history of psychiatric illness or genetic loading of significance. None of them had any other significant live stressor in personal life. Thus underlying the life threatening nature of Covid exposure as a healthcare worker and itâ€™s psychological implications. All of them were referred for vague symptoms like irritable mood, not able to function as before, physical symptoms of headache, marital discord etc. The exposure ranged from personal handling of serious covid patients to handling dead bodies in the mortuary to managing relatives of dying patients. No preventive distressing mechanism was available to them, the need of which is the learning from this study. Also , all of them were successfully treated with good outcome an d restored functionality, with empathetic support, rest, psycho education, relaxation and a short course of SSRIs Results: High index of suspicion, empathetic handling, psycho education, behavioral modifications and cognitive counseling with a short course of antidepressants helped all of them improve significantly with return to almost normal functioning. Conclusion: The Covid experience has been a life threatening experience for HCWs involved in treatment of serious covid patients during covid pandemic esp the second wave. It has been a never before experienced reality, completely overwhelming and traumatogenic enough to cause PTSD in some of them. For the few diagnosed as PTSD there would be many undiagnosed HCWs.

"Multilevel determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA: protocol for a concurrent triangulation, mixed-methods study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected communities of colour the hardest. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic pregnant women appear to have disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 infection and death rates. We will use the socioecological framework and employ a concurrent triangulation, mixed-methods study design to achieve three specific aims: (1) examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMMM); (2) explore how social contexts (eg, racial/ethnic residential segregation) have contributed to the widening of racial/ethnic disparities in SMMM during the pandemic and identify distinct mediating pathways through maternity care and mental health; and (3) determine the role of social contextual factors on racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related morbidities using machine learning algorithms. We will leverage an existing South Carolina COVID-19 Cohort by creating a pregnancy cohort that links COVID-19 testing data, electronic health records (EHRs), vital records data, healthcare utilisation data and billing data for all births in South Carolina (SC) between 2018 and 2021 (&gt;200Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 births). We will also conduct similar analyses using EHR data from the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative including &gt;270Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 women who had a childbirth between 2018 and 2021 in the USA. We will use a convergent parallel design which includes a quantitative analysis of data from the 2018-2021 SC Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (unweighted n&gt;2000) and in-depth interviews of 40 postpartum women and 10 maternal care providers to identify distinct mediating pathways. The study was approved by institutional review boards at the University of SC (Pro00115169) and the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC IRB.21-030).

"Acceptance commitment therapy (ACT) for psychological distress associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): protocol for a feasibility trial of the ACTforIBD programme","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an abnormal immune response to healthy gut bacteria. When a person develops IBD, their susceptibility to anxiety and/or depression increases. The ACTforIBD programme, specifically designed for people with IBD and comorbid psychological distress, draws on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), which promotes acceptance of situations that cannot be solved such as persistent physical symptoms. There are no ACT trials for IBD using an active control group or a telemedicine approach, which is important to improve accessibility, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The ACTforIBD programme is administered online with a 4-hour therapist involvement per participant only; if successful it can be widely implemented to improve the well-being of many individuals with IBD. Our team have codesigned with consumers the ACTforIBD programme, an 8-week intervention of 1-hour sessions, with the first three sessions and the last session delivered one-to-one by a psychologist, and the other sessions self-directed online. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of ACTforIBD to reduce psychological distress in patients with IBD. Using a randomised controlled trial, 25 participants will be randomised to ACTforIBD, and 25 patients to an active control condition. This protocol has been approved by Deakin University Research Ethics Committee in September 2021 (Ref. 2021-263) and the New Zealand Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee in December 2021 (Ref. 2021 EXP 11384).

A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted with a web-based global survey. Over three months, 3550 responses were collected from 65 countries. The study included 2689 responses without skipped questions as full data for analysis. Most respondents were women (82.82%), about half (52.81%) were between the ages of 25 and 39, followed by those between the ages of 40 and 60 (38.6%). Among participants, 52% indicated physical activity levels decreased and 20% reported eating less fruit and vegetables than before. Further, 45% noted they slept less than before. Perceived physical and mental health and changes to eating habits during the pandemic showed a significant difference in people with and without disabilities. Furthermore, perceived effects on physical health had a significant effect on the reported degree of disability. This study indicates that the pandemic had a larger impact on perceived physical and mental health and changes in eating habits and tobacco use among people with disabilities than people without disabilities.","Tuakli-Wosornu, Wang, Fourtassi, Stratton, MuÃƒÂ±oz-Velasco, Hajjioui, Cooper, Balikuddembe, Peterson, Pandiyan, Krassioukov, Tripathi, Palomba, Hong","https://doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000002056","20220610","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32651,""
"Comprehensive clinical assessment identifies specific neurocognitive deficits in working-age patients with long-COVID","There have been more than 425 million COVID-19 infections worldwide. Post-COVID illness has become a common, disabling complication of this infection. Therefore, it presents a significant challenge to global public health and economic activity. Comprehensive clinical assessment (symptoms, WHO performance status, cognitive testing, CPET, lung function, high-resolution CT chest, CT pulmonary angiogram and cardiac MRI) of previously well, working-age adults in full-time employment was conducted to identify physical and neurocognitive deficits in those with severe or prolonged COVID-19 illness. 205 consecutive patients, age 39 (IQR30.0-46.7) years, 84% male, were assessed 24 (IQR17.1-34.0) weeks after acute illness. 69% reported Ã¢â€°Â¥3 ongoing symptoms. Shortness of breath (61%), fatigue (54%) and cognitive problems (47%) were the most frequent symptoms, 17% met criteria for anxiety and 24% depression. 67% remained below pre-COVID performance status at 24 weeks. One third of lung function tests were abnormal, (reduced lung volume and transfer factor, and obstructive spirometry). HRCT lung was clinically indicated in &lt;50% of patients, with COVID-associated pathology found in 25% of these. In all but three HRCTs, changes were graded 'mild'. There was an extremely low incidence of pulmonary thromboembolic disease or significant cardiac pathology. A specific, focal cognitive deficit was identified in those with ongoing symptoms of fatigue, poor concentration, poor memory, low mood, and anxiety. This was notably more common in patients managed in the community during their acute illness. Despite low rates of residual cardiopulmonary pathology, in this cohort, with low rates of premorbid illness, there is a high burden of symptoms and failure to regain pre-COVID performance 6-months after acute illness. Cognitive assessment identified a specific deficit of the same magnitude as intoxication at the UK drink driving limit or the deterioration expected with 10 years ageing, which appears to contribute significantly to the symptomatology of long-COVID.","Holdsworth, Chamley, Barker-Davies, O'Sullivan, Ladlow, Mitchell, Dewson, Mills, May, Cranley, Xie, Sellon, Mulae, Naylor, Raman, Talbot, Rider, Bennett, Nicol","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267392","20220610","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32652,""

"What matters for adolescent suicidality: Depressive symptoms or fixed mindsets? Examination of cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between fixed mindsets and suicidal ideation","Fixed mindsets or beliefs about the non-malleability of self-attributes are linked to a wide range of negative psychological outcomes. Its association with suicidal ideation (SI) among young people has not been explored. To examine the association of fixed mindsets of depression, anxiety, and stress and SI; and its mediating role underlying the association between depression and SI. A sample of 1393 adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 13.04, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.85, 640 boys) from 11 middle schools voluntarily participated in a two-wave longitudinal study before and during the COVID-19 pandemic with a 9-month interval. Both depressive symptoms and fixed mindsets were positively and significantly associated with concurrent and future suicidality, after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic status and previous SI. Participants with stronger fixed mindsets were more likely to have SI than those with only depressive symptoms. Also, fixed mindsets mediated the association between depressive symptoms and SI in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models. The current study provides empirical evidence of the effects of fixed mindsets and SI and the mediating role of fixed mindset between depressive symptoms and SI among young people.

"COVID-19 and alcohol use disorder: putative differential gene expression patterns that might be associated with neurological complications","Several lines of evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the central nervous system leads to meningitis and encephalopathy syndromes. Additionally, chronic alcoholics were found to be at a high risk of developing mental health problems and serious neurological manifestations, if exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we studied RNA seq data from alcoholics' brain tissue and COVID-19 patient's brain tissue to identify the common differentially expressed genes. Overlap analysis depicted the expression of seven genes (<i>GHRL, SLN, VGF, IL1RL1, NPTX2, PDYN</i>, and <i>RPRML</i>) that were significantly upregulated in both groups. Along with these, protein-protein interaction analysis revealed ten other key molecules with strong interactions with the aforementioned genes. Taken together with the functional effect of these genes, we suggest a strong molecular link between COVID-19-induced severities and neurological impairment in patients suffering from alcohol abuse disorder. These findings emphasize the importance of identifying chronic alcoholism as a risk factor of developing cognitive and memory impairment in COVID-19 patients.","Muhammad, Siddiqui, Khan","https://doi.org/10.1080/21548331.2022.2088183","20220610","Alcoholism; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; in silico analysis; neurological manifestations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32656,""
"Peritraumatic distress across the lifespan: Clinical implications of age differences during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) is a well-known self-report questionnaire indexing the distress experienced during and shortly after a most stressful or traumatic event.

An international sample of 5 621 adult participants were grouped according the World Health Organization's age stratification protocol. Mean scores and item endorsement on the PDI were compared across groups with respect to their worst experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant between-group difference was found, F(5,5615) = 30.74 , p &lt; .001, n<sup>2</sup> = 0.027 whereby participants aged 18-39 years old reported the highest levels of peritraumatic distress. This group also endorsed a higher proportion of items on the PDI's two main factors (emotional distress and physical reactions), and were more likely to endorse feelings of helplessness, than older participants. It appears that severity of peritraumatic distress during the pandemic has affected younger people the most. Results are discussed in light of clinical implications.

"Coping Using Sex, Health-Related Behaviors, and Mental Health During COVID-19 Lockdown in the UK","Peoples' sexual behaviors have changed during the period of enforced COVID-19 social distancing, in some cases, to cope with negative feelings during lockdown. Research on coping using sex is relatively restricted to samples of men with a history of sexual offending, and it is unknown whether coping using sex is associated with health-related behaviors and mental health in the general population. We examined if coping using sex before and during lockdown was associated with adverse outcomes (i.e., self-perceived reduction in health-related behaviors and mental health) in a community sample. We hypothesized that participants who reported greater use of sex to cope in the weeks preceding lockdown would show a greater decline in health-related behaviors and mental health during lockdown. Furthermore, that changes in coping using sex resulting from lockdown would account for further variance in the worsening of health-related behaviors and mental health. Participants were UK residents, aged 18-60 years, and fluent in English. 789 participants completed an online survey, providing demographic information, self-reported social distancing, loneliness, and coping using sex over a 14-day period during lockdown, and retrospectively preceding lockdown. Participants reported perceived changes in health-related behaviors and mental health symptomatology during lockdown compared to before the pandemic. They also self-reported levels of stress, anxiety and depression during lockdown. Greater coping using sex prior to lockdown predicted positive change in health-related behaviors, for example, higher scores were associated with participants reporting having exercised and slept more. It was also associated with higher trait levels of anxiety, stress and depression during lockdown. Changes in coping using sex from before to during lockdown did not predict perceived changes in health related behaviors or mental health symptomatology. Overall, greater coping using sex prior to lockdown was associated with worse mental health symptomatology during lockdown (anxiety, depression and stress), however, it was also associated with perceived positive change in health-related behaviors compared with before lockdown. This suggests that coping using sex may be associated with negative emotional reactions during lockdown, but may also be linked with positive change in health-promoting behaviors.","Daly, Jones, Garofalo, Uzieblo, Robinson, Gillespie","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.880454","20220610","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; depression; health behavior; sex","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32660,""
"Coping and Anxiety During Lockdown in Spain: The Role of Perceived Impact and Information Sources","In the context of COVID-19 lockdowns, extant research suggests that secondary coping (a strategy aimed at adjusting oneself self to the stressor) is more robustly associated with better mental health than primary coping (a strategy aimed at adjusting the stressor to oneself). We investigated whether these findings are generalizable to Spain-one of the most severely affected countries at that time. We also tested whether the link between secondary coping and mental health (as measured by anxiety) can be accounted for by how individuals perceive the COVID-19 impact (ie, perceived life changes and personal global impact) and how frequently they use traditional and social media to check COVID-19-related information. A diverse community sample (N = 408), collected during the first lockdown in Spain (early April 2020), completed a multi-measure online survey including the targeted variables. Secondary coping outperformed primary coping in predicting reduced anxiety during the lockdown in Spain. Moreover, lower perceived life changes from COVID-19 and reduced personal global impact from COVID-19 both mediated the negative secondary coping-anxiety relationship. No indirect effects emerged for either conventional or social media exposure. These results (a) strengthen the cross-cultural validity of the link between secondary coping and anxiety and (b) advance our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying this association.","English, Torres-MarÃƒÂ­n, Navarro-Carrillo","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S362849","20220610","COVID-19 life changes; Spanish lockdown; anxiety; media exposure; secondary coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32661,""
"A Unified Model of Resilience and Aging: Applications to COVID-19","Drawing on multidisciplinary research focusing on a spectrum ranging from individual experience to structural system-level risk response and resilience, this article develops a rationale for a Unified Model of Resilience and Aging (UMRA). In response to a broad range of adversities associated with aging, it details the ways in which some individuals are able to bounce back better than others, or adapt better than expected, termed resilience. However, resilience and aging theoretical models have developed out of different disciplinary developments, ranging from individual levels to structural level complex systems, including several gerontological theoretical models addressing adaptation to life course and aging processes. The article reviews and synthesizes prior conceptual and theoretical work, and their empirical groundings, in order to develop an integrated resilience model with wide applications to aging-related problems including chronic illness, mental health, widowhood, poverty, caregiving burden, etc. The article focuses specifically on COVID-19 pandemic risk, response and resilience in order to specify applications of the UMRA, and to suggest avenues for future research and testing of theoretical axioms.","Wister, Klasa, Linkov","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.865459","20220610","COVID-19; aging; resilience; systems; unified model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32662,""
"Prevalence of Neuropathic Component in Post-COVID Pain Symptoms in Previously Hospitalized COVID-19 Survivors","To investigate the prevalence of neuropathic pain symptoms and to analyze the correlation between neuropathic symptoms with pain-related, psychological, and cognitive variables in COVID-19 survivors exhibiting ""de novo"" post-COVID pain. Seventy-seven (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°77) previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors presenting with post-COVID pain completed demographic (such as age, height, and weight), pain-related (the duration and intensity of pain), psychological (depressive/anxiety levels), and cognitive (catastrophizing and kinesiophobia) variables. The Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) questionnaire was also assessed. After conducting multivariable correlation analyses, a stepwise multiple linear regression model was performed to identify S-LANSS predictors. Participants were assessed a mean of 6.0 (SD 0.8) months after hospital discharge. Nineteen (24.6%) exhibited neuropathic pain symptoms (S-LANSS scoreÃ¢â€°Â¥12 points). The S-LANSS score was positively associated with the duration of post-COVID pain (<i>r</i>: 0.262), anxiety levels (<i>r</i>: 0.275), and kinesiophobia level (<i>r</i>: 0.291) (all, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).

"Intensivist and COVID-19 in the United States of America: a narrative review of clinical roles, current workforce, and future direction","COVID-19 continues to spread across borders and has proven to be a challenge for the existing healthcare system. The demand for intensivists has dramatically increased in the United States, in the backdrop of an expected lack of intensivists in many States even before the pandemic. One proposal has been to organize multidisciplinary teams functioning under one intensivist, as this approach would make use of the existing healthcare force and lessen the burden on intensivists. Another recommendation is the adaptation of Tele-ICUs, which have demonstrated constructive outcomes in the past. Moreover, ensuring the provision of all types of personal protective equipment, adequate testing and, other provisions such as mental health support, financial incentives for intensivists should be prioritized.

"Potential Triggers for Risking the Development of Eating Disorders in Non-Clinical Higher-Education Students in Emerging Adulthood","Nowadays, eating disorders (ED) among individuals during emerging adulthood have become a crucial challenge to public health, taking into account the fact that the global prevalence of the ED risk in student-aged populations already stands at 10.4% and has been sharply increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic. In all, from 50% to 80% of all the ED cases go undetected or are not correctly diagnosed; moreover, these individuals do not receive specialized treatment. Therefore, early diagnosis detected via screening questionnaires for ED is highly recommended. This study aimed to identify the triggers for ED risk development in emerging-adulthood individuals and to reveal the factors significant not only for ED prevention but also for assessing individuals with subthreshold symptoms. This cross-sectional study provides the results for the ED symptom screening in 1716 Lithuanian higher-education students aged 21.2 Ã‚Â± 3.9, during emerging adulthood. According to the results of this study, 19.2% of students were at risk for ED. Potential risk factors such as sex (odds ratio (OR): 3.1, 95% CI: 1.9-4.9), body weight (self-reported body mass index) (adjusted (A) OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7) and comorbidities such as smoking (AOR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.6-2.8), and perceived stress during the pandemic (AOR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.8) are involved in anticipating the symptomatology of ED during emerging adulthood. Regular initial screenings with universally adopted questionnaires and further referral to a psychiatrist must be applied to promote both the diagnosis of early-onset symptomatology and the treatment of these ED in student-aged populations. Preventive programs for reducing the prevalence of overweight or obesity among students during emerging adulthood should focus on integration directions for the development of a positive body image.","Baranauskas, KupÃ„ÂiÃ…Â«naitÃ„â€”, Stukas","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14112293","20220610","COVID-19 pandemic; eating disorder; emerging adulthood; higher-education students; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32665,""
"Psychological Interventions in a Pandemic Emergency: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Studies","The study aim was to review the evidence and effectiveness of psychological interventions applied during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. A literature search was run from April 2020 to April 2021. The inclusion criteria were: (1) RCTs or observational studies; (2) professional health carers and patients who had contracted coronavirus during the pandemic; (3) adults and elderly people with a viral infection diagnosis; (4) suitable measures to assess intervention effectiveness on clinical status and psychological and behavioral aspects. An internal validity assessment was planned using robvis. Data were synthesized according to PICO criteria. A total of 12 studies were selected. Studies measuring mental health outcomes demonstrated the greatest reduction in symptoms, with eight out of the twelve studies demonstrating a reduction in symptoms that reached statistical significance (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) and four of the studies reaching a higher significance level of <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01.

"Hand Washing: When Ritual Behavior Protects! Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms in Young People during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a profound impact on the lifestyles and mental health of young people. It has been hypothesized that the focus on hygiene and the fear of contamination/infection during the pandemic may have exacerbated obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in this population. OC symptoms are widespread in the general population, with varying degrees of intensity. At their most extreme, they manifest in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is characterized by obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. The present narrative review aimed at evaluating the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and OCD and OC symptoms in young people, especially children and adolescents with and without OCD, focusing on vulnerability and risk factors and the impact of lockdown measures. Of the six studies identified, four examined clinical samples diagnosed with OCD and two looked at community-based adolescent samples. Five of the six studies found that OC symptoms increased during the pandemic. Additionally, vulnerability to anxiety may constitute a risk condition and the lockdown measures and personal stressful life events can constitute potential triggers of OC symptoms, while ongoing treatment for OCD had a protective effect. The results suggest that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, obsessive and compulsive behavior (e.g., hand washing) in young people at the greatest risk should be monitored, and the intervention of mental health services should be maintained. More research is needed in this area.","Demaria, Pontillo, Di Vincenzo, Di Luzio, Vicari","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11113191","20220610","COVID-19; OCD; hand washing; obsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive symptoms; pandemic; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32667,""
"Psychological Effects and Medication Adherence among Korean Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Single-Center Survey","This study evaluated the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. We quantified anxiety, depression, and medication adherence among IBD patients through a single-center survey in South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. An electronic survey was made available to patients at the IBD clinic in Daejeon St. Mary's hospital from July 2021 to September 2021. The validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess depression and anxiety. The Korean version of the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (KMARS) questionnaire was used to assess medication adherence. In total, 407 patients (56.5%; ulcerative colitis, 43.5%; Crohn's disease) participated in the survey. Among the respondents, 14.5% showed significant anxiety and 26.3% showed significant depression. Female sex, presence of mental disease, unvaccinated status, and the presence of Crohn's disease were associated with greater risks of anxiety and depression. Among medications, immunomodulators were associated with a greater risk of anxiety. In terms of KMARS, patients reported favorable medication adherence despite the psychological burden of the pandemic. The KMARS score was 7.3 Ã‚Â± 1.5 (mean Ã‚Â± SD) of 10.0 points. High anxiety and depression were associated with a slight decrease in medication adherence. COVID-19 has increased anxiety and depression among IBD patients, whose medication adherence has nevertheless remained good. Furthermore, anxiety and depression were found to have a negative correlation with adherence. Our results provide insights concerning psychological response and medication adherence among IBD patients in South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ryu, Kang, Jung, Lee, Kang","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11113034","20220610","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; inflammatory bowel disease; medication adherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32668,""

"Mediating Effects of Social Support and Resilience on the Association between COVID-19-Related Stress and Mental Health in Korean Young Adults","Young adults were vulnerable to mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the underlying pathway by which COVID-19-related stress influences mental health outcomes among young adults remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of social support and resilience between COVID-19-related stress and mental health outcomes. A sample of 1000 Korean young adults was obtained via online survey. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing COVID-19-related stress, social support, resilience, depression, and anxiety. Overall, 48.1% and 23.4% of participants were classified as having depression and anxiety states, respectively. Path analysis using AMOS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) showed that the direct effects of stress from social distancing difficulties on depression and anxiety were much greater than those of stress from fear of infection and anger toward others. In addition, there were significant indirect effects of social support and resilience in the relationship between stress related to difficulties due to social distancing and mental health outcomes. The mediating roles of social support and resilience suggest that interventions to increase these factors can be effective strategies to reduce the risks of depression and anxiety among young adults suffering from stress related to social distancing difficulties.","Noh, Park","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116935","20220610","COVID-19-related stress; anxiety; depression; resilience; social support; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32670,""

"Digital Addiction and Sleep","In 2020, the World Health Organization formally recognized addiction to digital technology (connected devices) as a worldwide problem, where excessive online activity and internet use lead to inability to manage time, energy, and attention during daytime and produce disturbed sleep patterns or insomnia during nighttime. Recent studies have shown that the problem has increased in magnitude worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which dysfunctional sleep is a consequence of altered motivation, memory function, mood, diet, and other lifestyle variables or results from excess of blue-light exposure when looking at digital device screens for long hours at day and night is one of many still unresolved questions. This article offers a narrative overview of some of the most recent literature on this topic. The analysis provided offers a conceptual basis for understanding digital addiction as one of the major reasons why people, and adolescents in particular, sleep less and less well in the digital age. It discusses definitions as well as mechanistic model accounts in context. Digital addiction is identified as functionally equivalent to all addictions, characterized by the compulsive, habitual, and uncontrolled use of digital devices and an excessively repeated engagement in a particular online behavior. Once the urge to be online has become uncontrollable, it is always accompanied by severe sleep loss, emotional distress, depression, and memory dysfunction. In extreme cases, it may lead to suicide. The syndrome has been linked to the known chronic effects of all drugs, producing disturbances in cellular and molecular mechanisms of the GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems. Dopamine and serotonin synaptic plasticity, essential for impulse control, memory, and sleep function, are measurably altered. The full spectrum of behavioral symptoms in digital addicts include eating disorders and withdrawal from outdoor and social life. Evidence pointing towards dysfunctional melatonin and vitamin D metabolism in digital addicts should be taken into account for carving out perspectives for treatment. The conclusions offer a holistic account for digital addiction, where sleep deficit is one of the key factors.","Dresp-Langley, Hutt","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116910","20220610","addiction; depression; digital environments; dopamine; iRISA syndrome; internet; melatonin; obesity; overexposure; oxidative stress; serotonin; sleep loss; vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32672,""

Our findings suggest a significant long-term impact on health and quality of life due to COVID-19, and as waves of ASRS-CoV-2 infections emerge, the long-term effects of COVID-19 will not only increase the difficulty of care for COVID-19 survivors and the setting of public health policy but also might lead to another public health crisis following the current pandemic, which would also increase the global long-term burden of disease.","Ma, Deng, Liu, Du, Liu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116865","20220610","COVID-19; long-term consequence; meta-analysis; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32676,""
"Seroprevalence of COVID-19 and Psychological Distress among Front Liners at the Universiti Malaysia Sabah Campus during the Third Wave of COVID-19","In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck the globe and disrupted various aspects of psychological wellbeing, more so in frontline workers. Research on assessing the seroprevalence of COVID-19 has been scarce; in addition, there are limited studies assessing the association between the seroprevalence of COVID-19 and psychological distress. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 and the prevalence of psychological distress and to determine whether sociodemographic variables, occupational information variables, coping styles, and psychological processes might contribute to the development of psychological distress. A cross-sectional study involving 168 Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) front liners was carried out to assess these issues. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess psychological distress, together with the COVID-19 Rapid Test Kit Antibody (RTK Ab) and a series of questionnaires, including a sociodemographic and occupational information questionnaire, the Balanced Index of Psychological Mindedness (BIPM) questionnaire, the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS), the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), and the Brief COPE questionnaire. The results demonstrated a seroprevalence of COVID-19 at 8.3% (95% CI = 5.0-14.0). Non-healthcare workers (HCWs) had a higher COVID-19 prevalence. Meanwhile, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among front liners was low (3.0%, 3.6%, and 1.2%, respectively). Younger people (aged 30 years old or less) and HCWs had a higher prevalence of psychological distress; being a HCW was significantly associated with a higher level of anxiety. Dysfunctional coping and psychological inflexibility were consistently found to be predictors for higher levels of the three psychological distress variables. This study suggested some alternatives that could be explored by mental health providers to address mental health issues among front liners at universities.","Hijazi, Jeffree, Pang, Rahim, Omar, Ahmedy, Hijazi, Hassan, Hod, Nawi, Daim, Wider","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116840","20220610","COVID-19; coping styles; front liner; mindfulness; psychological distress; psychological inflexibiliy; psychological mindedness; seroprevalence; university","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32677,""
"Mental Health Status of University Students and Working Professionals during the Early Stage of COVID-19 in Bangladesh","A novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 has spread globally and brought a public health emergency to all nations. To respond to the pandemic, the Bangladesh Government imposed a nationwide lockdown that may have degraded mental health among residents, in particular, university students and working professionals. We examined clinically significant anxiety levels with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and perceived stress levels with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) in an online cross-sectional study with 744 adults. Approximately 70% of respondents were afflicted with clinically significant anxiety levels, and more than 43.82% were afflicted with moderate or high perceived stress levels. Multivariate logistic regression models showed that postgraduates (OR = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-8.75, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) were more likely to experience anxiety than their student counterparts. No such differences emerged for working professionals, however. Living with family members compared to living alone was a risk factor for perceived stress among working professionals (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.45-11.32, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). COVID-19 stressors such as financial hardship (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.11-3.05, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) and worries of family members' health (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.12-2.99) were risk factors for anxiety among students. Questionable social media news exposure (OR = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.13-7.92, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) contributed to the development of mental stress among working professionals. These findings confirm that effective initiatives and proactive efforts from concerned authorities are necessary to cope with the mental health correlates of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in developing contexts such as Bangladesh.","Patwary, Bardhan, Disha, Kabir, Hossain, Alam, Haque, Billah, Browning, Kabir, Swed, Shoib","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116834","20220610","Bangladesh; COVID-19; mental health; university students; working professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32678,""
"Lockdown Due to COVID-19 and Its Consequences on Diet, Physical Activity, Lifestyle, and Other Aspects of Daily Life Worldwide: A Narrative Review","The novel coronavirus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Besides the important rates of mortality and morbidity directly attributed to the infection itself, many studies detected an important shift towards mostly unhealthy lifestyle patterns in previously healthy non-infected populations all around the world. Although most of the changes in lifestyle had or will have a negative impact on general population health status, some findings are encouraging. Notwithstanding that there was an obvious necessity for governments to apply national lockdowns, it is also necessary to identify and comprehend the consequences they have caused. A narrative literature review was performed, based on scientific articles and previous reviews. An accurate description of changes in eating habits and alcohol consumption, physical activity, mental health, daily routines, economic impacts, and broader effects on society is provided for each continent and different age groups through this review.

"Psychotherapists' Reports regarding the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Their Patients: A Cross-National Descriptive Study Based on the Social-Ecological Model (SEM)","The COVID-19 outbreak has raised questions about how vulnerable groups experience the pandemic. Research that focuses on the view of individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions is still limited, and so are cross-country comparative surveys. We gathered our sample of qualitative data during the first lockdown after governmental measures against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus came into force in Austria, Czechia, Germany, and Slovakia. A total of <i>n</i> = 1690 psychotherapists from four middle European countries answered the question of how the COVID-19 pandemic was addressed in sessions by their patients during the early stage of unprecedented public health conditions. We employed a descriptive qualitative methodology to determine themes following levels of the social-ecological model (SEM) regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic affected patients. At the public policy level, stressful environmental conditions concerned the governmental mitigation efforts. At the level of community/society, reported key themes were employment, restricted access to educational and health facilities, socioeconomic consequences, and the pandemic itself. Key themes at the interpersonal level regarded forced proximity, the possibility of infection of loved ones, childcare, and homeschooling. Key themes at the individual level were the possibility of contracting COVID-19, having to stay at home/isolation, and a changing environment. Within the SEM framework, adaptive and maladaptive responses to these stressors were reported, with more similarities than differences between the countries. A quantification of word stems showed that the maladaptive reactions predominated.","Schaffler, Kuska, Barke, Doering, Gossmann, Meier, Kascakova, Tavel, Humer, Pieh, Stippl, SchimbÃƒÂ¶ck, Haid, Probst","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116825","20220610","COVID-19; adaptive responses; maladaptive responses; mental health; pandemic; psychotherapy; social environment; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32680,""
"Return to Work of Healthcare Workers after SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Determinants of Physical and Mental Health","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has involved healthcare workers (HCWs) both as caregivers and as patients. This study is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the HCWs working in a third-level hospital in Central Italy who were infected with COVID-19 from March 2020 to April 2021. This research aims at identifying the physical and mental health outcomes of HCWs infected with COVID-19 who returned to work after the infection, the determinants of those outcomes, such as age and sex, and the identification of possible vulnerable professional groups. A questionnaire about the acute illness, the experience of returning to work, and health perceptions after the disease was administered to 427 healthcare workers 3 months after recovering from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority interviewed (84.5%) reported symptoms at the time of the positive test, with no significant differences regarding age or sex, while a significant difference in the mean age was found regarding hospitalization (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). At 3 months after the infection, females (<i>p</i> = 0.001), older workers (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and healthcare assistants (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) were more likely to report persistent symptoms. Sex (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and age (<i>p</i> = 0.006) influenced the quality of sleep after the infection. At work, the nurses group reported increase in workload (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and worse relationships (<i>p</i> = 0.028). At 3 months after the infection, female workers perceived worse physical (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and mental (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) health status according to the SF-12.

A significant difference in PCS score was found between nurses and physicians (<i>p</i> = 0.04) and between residents and all other groups (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Finally, the group of workers reporting sleep alterations showed lower PCS and MCS scores (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and working relationships had an impact on MCS scores (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Age, sex, and type of job had an impact on physical and mental outcomes.

"The Effect of Social Isolation Types on Quality of Life during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study","COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic that has spread rapidly to six continents, with over 2.5 million deaths from December 2019 to March 2021. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is still growing worldwide, and quarantines have been recommended to prevent the disease's spread. However, quarantines affect people's quality of life (QOL). The aim of this study is to assess the effect of social isolation-quarantine-on QOL during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used in the present study. We obtained data from an online survey conducted in Saudi Arabia. We included a convenience sample of 775 participants in the study. Most of the participants were female (67%), with a mean age of 46 years ranging from 18 to 75 years. Many participants were government employees (n = 308, 39.7%) and had a bachelor's degree or greater (n = 513, 66.2%). Most of the participants (n = 629, 81%) were free from any chronic disease. Nearly 88% of participants were partially isolated socially owing to COVID-19. Concerning QOL, the means of both the Physical Health Composite Scale and the Mental Health Composite Scale SF-12 scores were 44.7 and 34.6, respectively. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that partially socially isolated participants appeared to have significantly better physical health statuses (M = 44.96, SD = 5.90) than completely socially isolated participants (M = 42.87 Ã‚Â± 7.26). There was no significant social isolation effect on mental health status (t (773) = 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.115). Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic considerably influenced various aspects of QOL including physical and mental health.

"Use of an Online Platform to Evaluate the Impact of Social Distancing Measures on Psycho-Physical Well-Being in the COVID-19 Era","<i>Background:</i> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) and the worldwide health crisis have significantly changed both people's habits and lifestyles. Most of the studies found in the literature were carried out on specific professional categories in the socio-health sector, taking into consideration psychological disorders in relation to work. The purpose of this study was to analyze the psychological impact on a portion of the normal population subjected to lockdown. <i>Methods:</i> A questionnaire was distributed in the period between 23 March 2020 and 18 May 2020 (during Italian lockdown) using an online platform. The scales GAD-7, IES-r, PHQ-9 and MANSA were used to investigate the level of anxiety, the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder, the severity of depression and the perceived quality of life, respectively. <i>Results:</i> Four hundred and eight Italian subjects responded.

"Impact of School and Peer Connectedness on Adolescent Mental Health and Well-Being Outcomes during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Panel Survey","School closures and social distancing measures during the pandemic have disrupted young people's daily routines and social relationships. We explored patterns of change in adolescent mental health and tested the relationship between pre-pandemic levels of school and peer connectedness and changes in mental health and well-being between the first lockdown and the return to school. This is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal 3-wave panel survey. The study sample included 603 students (aged 13-14) in 17 secondary schools across south-west England. Students completed a survey pre-pandemic (October 2019), during lockdown (May 2020) and shortly after returning to school (October 2020). Multilevel models, with random effects, were conducted for anxiety, depression and well-being outcomes with school and peer connectedness as predictor variables. Symptoms of anxiety decreased from pre-pandemic to during the first UK lockdown and increased on the return to school; anxious symptoms decreased the most for students reporting feeling least connected to school pre-pandemic. Students reporting low levels of school and peer connectedness pre-pandemic experienced poorer mental health and well-being at all time points. Low school connectedness pre-pandemic was associated with a greater increase in anxious and depressive symptoms between lockdown and the return to school when compared to students with medium levels of school connectedness. No associations were found with high school connectedness or with low/high peer connectedness. For adolescents with poor school connectedness, the enforced time away from school that the pandemic caused led to reduced anxiety. Going forwards, we need to consider ways in which to promote connection with school as a way of supporting mental health and well-being.","Widnall, Winstone, Plackett, Adams, Haworth, Mars, Kidger","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116768","20220610","COVID-19; adolescents; lockdown; mental health; school; social connectedness; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32685,""
"The Differential Consequences of Fear, Anger, and Depression in Response to COVID-19 in South Korea","Studies on previous outbreaks of contagious diseases suggest that the impact of the emotions associated with an epidemic can be greater than that of the epidemic in terms of the number of people affected. This study explores the relationships between the three most commonly expressed emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic (fear, anger, and depression) and two outcome variables (compliance with the social-distancing policy and the stigmatization of those infected by COVID-19). A large online, public opinion survey was conducted in South Korea (<i>n</i> = 1000) between 4 and 11 June 2020, which was between the first and the second waves of COVID-19. A series of regression analyses suggest that the emotional response was accompanied by differential behavioral and perceptual consequences. Fear was consistently positively related to all indicators of compliance with social-distancing policies (the voluntary practice of social distancing, support for the ""routine-life-distancing"" policy, and support for stronger social-distancing policies). Anger was positively related to both stigmatization indicators (responsibility attribution and stigmatizing attitude toward people infected with COVID-19). Finally, depression showed negative relationships with support for the ""routine-life-distancing"" policy and for stronger social-distancing policies but a positive relationship with the voluntary practice of social distancing. By examining whether and how certain types of emotional responses are more or less related to compliance with social distancing and stigmatization, the present study provides practical implications for effective public communication during an epidemic such as COVID-19.","Choi, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116723","20220610","COVID-19; anger; depression; fear; social distancing; stigmatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32686,""
"The Role of Resilience, Happiness, and Social Support in the Psychological Function during the Late Stages of the Lockdown in Individuals with and without Chronic Pain","There is mounting evidence to suggest that individuals with chronic pain adjusted poorly to and were impacted negatively by social distancing measures during the lockdown. However, there is limited data on the factors that might protect against the negative effects associated with social distancing measures, as most research has been conducted in the general population and in the initial stages of the lockdown. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the role that resilience, happiness, and social support, all factors that are thought to have a protective role, played in the psychological function (measured as anxiety, depression, and stress) to the social distancing measures during the late stages of the lockdown in a sample of adults with and without chronic pain living in Spain. A group of 434 adults responded to an online survey and provided information on sociodemographic issues, which included measures of pain, perceived health and quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, happiness, and social support. The data showed that individuals with chronic pain (N = 200; 46%) reported statistically significant worst psychological function, that is to say, they reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress (all <i>p</i>s &amp;lt; 0.001). Resilience, social support, and happiness proved to be significant predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress, after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and chronic pain. Although the effect sizes were small to medium, they are consistent with the findings of other studies. The findings from this study provide important additional new information regarding the associations between resilience, happiness, and social support and the adjustment to the social distancing measures during the late stages of the lockdown. These findings can be used to develop programs to improve adjustment to and coping with the demands of social distancing measures.","MirÃƒÂ³, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Nolla, Costa, Pais-Ribeiro, Ferreira-Valente","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116708","20220610","COVID-19; happiness; pain; resilience; social distancing measures; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32687,""
"Did the Socio-Economic Gradient in Depression in Later-Life Deteriorate or Weaken during the COVID-19 Pandemic? New Evidence from England Using Path Analysis","It is well established that there is a socioeconomic gradient in adult mental health. However, little is known about whether and how this gradient has been exacerbated or mitigated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to identify the modifiable pathways involved in the association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis included 5107 adults aged 50+ living in England and participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing Wave nine (2018-2019) and the COVID-19 study (June 2020). Mental health was measured using a shortened version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Path analysis with multiple mediator models was used to estimate the direct effect of SEP (measured by educational qualification and household wealth) on mental health (measured by depression), along with the indirect effects of SEP via three mediators: COVID-19 infection symptoms, service accessibility and social contact. The results show that the prevalence of depression for the same cohort increased from 12.6% pre-pandemic to 19.7% during the first wave of the pandemic. The risk of depression increased amongst older people who experienced COVID-19 infection, difficulties accessing services and less frequent social contact. The total effects of education and wealth on depression were negatively significant. Through mediators, wealth and education were indirectly associated with depression. Wealth also directly affected the outcome. The findings suggest that the socioeconomic gradient in depression among older people may have deteriorated during the initial phase of the pandemic and that this could in part be explained by increased financial hardship, difficulties in accessing services and reduced social contact.","Qin, Evandrou, Falkingham, Vlachantoni","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116700","20220610","COVID-19 pandemic; England; depression; older adults; socioeconomic position","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32688,""

This study tested the responsiveness and construct validity of the original version of the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRS) in a cohort of Italian hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This longitudinal study involved 79 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with rehabilitation needs, assessed after 12 and 26 weeks post-infection. Functional and patient-reported outcome measures were correlated with 10 items of the C19-YRS to test the construct validity, whereas distribution-based methods were used for the responsiveness over time. After 12 weeks since infection, 88.5% of patients reported fatigue, 83.3% breathlessness, 69.4% anxiety, 55.6% depression, and 44.9% pain. Moreover, 84.6% experienced reduced mobility, 75.7% had difficulties with usual activities, and 47.4% with personal care. Single items for each symptom had significant correlation (rho 0.25-0.60) with well-established scales for these symptoms. At 26 weeks, except for anxiety, all the PCS symptoms were still present but significantly reduced. The C19-YRS had moderate responsiveness for the most represented deficit reported. The C19-YRS was a valuable patient-reported outcome for screening, assessing severity, and monitoring the persistence of symptoms after 12 and 26 weeks from SARS-CoV2 infection in a cohort of Italian hospitalized patients.","Straudi, Manfredini, Baroni, Milani, Fregna, Schincaglia, Androni, Occhi, Sivan, Lamberti","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116696","20220610","COVID-19; Post-COVID Syndrome; outcome measures; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32689,""

This study aims to elucidate the direct or indirect influence of IGD on ADHD; (2) Method: The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Version IV questionnaire was used to evaluate symptoms of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder, and the Chen gaming disorder scale was used to measure IGD. A psychiatrist diagnosed ADHD, IGD, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)-like symptoms. Structural equation modeling was applied to evaluate the role of IGD in mediating ADHD progression to disruptive mood dysregulation; (3) Results: Among a total of 102 ADHD youths, 53 (52%) of them with IGD were significantly more likely to have poor interpersonal relationships (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and DMDD-like symptoms (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) than ADHD youths without IGD. IGD played a mediating role in increasing the risk of disruptive mood dysregulation in ADHD youths; (4) Conclusions: The findings suggest that IGD mediates ADHD's progression to disruptive mood dysregulation. Intensive biopsychosocial interventions are warranted for ADHD youths with IGD. More children and adolescents became mood-dysregulated after excessive gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic; this study's results suggest that child mental health experts develop earlier detection and prevention strategies for children and adolescents hidden behind internet addiction.","Tzang, Chang, Chang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116648","20220610","ADHD; DMDD; IGD; SEM; mediator","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32690,""
"""Lived the Pandemic Twice"": A Scoping Review of the Unequal Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Asylum Seekers and Undocumented Migrants","Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is widening pre-pandemic health, social, and economic inequalities between refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers and the general population. This global scoping review examined the impact of the pandemic on community-based asylum seekers and undocumented migrants in high- and upper-middle-income countries. We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed articles in <i>PubMed</i>, <i>Scopus</i>, <i>Web of Science</i>, and <i>ProQuest Central</i>. We applied Katikireddi's framework of understanding and addressing inequalities to examine the differential impact of the pandemic across exposure, vulnerability to infection, disease consequences, social consequences, effectiveness of control measures, and adverse consequences of control measures. We included 32 articles in the review. The analysis showed that asylum seekers and undocumented migrants experienced greater exposure to the COVID-19 virus and higher infection rates. They also experienced differential social consequences in the form of job loss and lost and/or reduced work hours. The effectiveness of pandemic response measures on asylum seekers and undocumented migrants was also affected by pre-pandemic social and economic marginalisation, exclusion from pandemic-induced policy measures, lack of appropriate pandemic communication, and variable trust in governments and authority. Pandemic control measures had greater adverse consequences on asylum seekers and undocumented migrants than the general population, with the majority of studies included in this review reporting worsened mental health and social isolation conditions and reduced access to health care. Asylum seekers and undocumented migrants experienced a disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the six thematic areas of comparison. Policies that reduce exposure and vulnerability to the infection, grant equitable access to health and social care, and build capacities and resilience, are critical to enable asylum seekers and undocumented migrants to cope with and recover from pre-pandemic and pandemic-induced inequalities.","Mengesha, Alloun, Weber, Smith, Harris","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116624","20220610","COVID-19; asylum seekers; impact; inequity; undocumented migrants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32691,""
"Utilization of Mind-Body Intervention for Integrative Health Care of COVID-19 Patients and Survivors","Recent findings suggest a correlation between COVID-19 and diabetes, although the underlying causes are still little understood. COVID-19 infection tends to induce severe symptoms in patients with underlying diabetes, increasing their mortality rate. Moreover, COVID-19 itself appears to be a diabetogenic factor. In addition, mental health conditions, such as depression due to lockdown and anxiety about infection, were found to affect glycemic control and immunity, highlighting the importance of mental health care during the pandemic. Mind-Body Intervention (MBI), which includes meditation, yoga, and qigong, has emerged as a tool for mental health management due to its effects on stress reduction and the promotion of mental and physical well-being. Here, we review the latest randomized controlled trials to determine the effects of MBI on glycemic control and the immune system and discuss the underlying mechanisms by which MBI facilitates the virtuous cycle of stress management, glycemic control, and immune modulation. Furthermore, we examine the actual utilization of MBI during the COVID-19 pandemic era through recent studies. With proper online education, non-pharmacological MBI may be more widely used as an important tool for self-health care that complements the usual treatment of COVID-19 patients and survivors.","Yang, Setou, Koh","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116618","20220610","COVID-19; MindÃ¢â‚¬â€œBody Intervention; blood glucose; diabetes; immune; long COVID; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32692,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Related Social Distancing on Mental Health Outcomes: A Transdiagnostic Account","The COVID-19 pandemic, and the social distancing practices that followed, have been associated with increased prevalence of emotional disorders. However, not all individuals affected by COVID-19-related social distancing experienced elevations in emotional disorder symptoms. Understanding this phenomenon is of crucial public health significance given the burden of emotional disorders on individuals and systems. In this narrative review, we consider the differential impact of COVID-19-related social distancing on mental health outcomes from a transdiagnostic perspective. We argue that individuals high in negative affect and aversive reactivity to emotion, that is, neuroticism, and who respond to such emotional experiences with emotion-motivated avoidant coping, are most likely to experience emotional disorders in the context of COVID-19 social distancing. We acknowledge the pro-social and adaptive function of some types of avoidance during the pandemic, which may have initially buffered against negative mental health outcomes. Implications of this conceptualization for treatment of emotional disorders in the present sociocultural context are discussed.","Spencer-Laitt, Eustis, Barlow, Farchione","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116596","20220610","COVID-19; anxiety; avoidance; emotional disorder; neuroticism; unified protocol","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32693,""
"The Impact of Physical Activity on Mental Health during COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A Systematic Review","The outbreak and spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2019 was a public health emergency of global concern. As an important health behavior, physical activity (PA) and its impact on mental health have been increasingly explored during the epidemic period. The keywords and references were searched on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and CNKI since the inception of an electronic bibliographic database until October 2021. A total of 2979 articles were identified, of which 23 were eligible for inclusion to examine the relationship between PA and mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic. Residents with regular PA, high-intensity PA, and PA duration of 30-60 min or more per day were associated with a lower risk of anxiety, depression, and negative emotions. In contrast, residents with no exercise and physical inactivity were more likely to have anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and lower subjective well-being. In addition, the dose-response curve between PA and negative emotions indicated a U-shaped relationship, and there were urban-rural differences in the relationship between emotional status and the levels of PA in adolescents. The findings have significant implications for addressing mental health issues during the current pandemic and future pandemics. Future studies adopting an experimental study design, conducting objective PA measures, and focusing on the vulnerable subpopulations are warranted to further explore the association of PA on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Wang, Shen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116584","20220610","COVID-19; China; anxiety; depression; mental health; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32694,""
"Effects of COVID-19 Restriction Policies on Urban Heat Islands in Some European Cities: Berlin, London, Paris, Madrid, and Frankfurt","The present study investigates the effects of policies restricting human activities during the COVID-19 epidemic on the characteristics of Night Land Surface Temperature (NLST) and Night Urban Heat Islands (NUHI) in five major European cities. In fact, the focus of this study was to explore the role of anthropogenic factors in the formation and intensity of NUHI. The effect of such factors was uncontrollable before the COVID-19 outbreak on the global scale and in a real non-laboratory environment. In this study, two indices, the concentration of Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and Nighttime Lights (NL), were used as indicators of the number of anthropogenic activities. The data were collected before the COVID-19 outbreak and after its prevalence in 2019-2020. A Paired samples <i>t</i>-test and a Pearson correlation were used to examine the differences or significant relationships between the variables and indicators studied throughout the two periods. The results of the study confirmed a direct and significant relationship between NO<sub>2</sub> and NL indices and the NUHI and NLST variables; however, using strict restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the NO<sub>2</sub> and NL indices decreased seriously, leading to significant changes in the characteristics of the NUHI and NLST in the five cities. This study has some implications for urban planners and politicians, e.g., the environmental impacts of changing the nature and level of anthropogenic activities can greatly affect the pattern and intensity of the Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) (as a serious environmental challenge).","Safarrad, Ghadami, Dittmann","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116579","20220610","COVID-19; European cities; restriction policies; urban heat island","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32695,""
"Resilience, Mentalizing and Burnout Syndrome among Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Serbia","The aim of this study was to examine whether the capacity for mentalizing and resilience among healthcare workers (HCWs) explains the degree of burnout syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia. The research was conducted on a sample of 406 healthcare workers (141 doctors and 265 nurses), aged 19 to 65 years (M = 40.11, SD = 9.41)-203 worked on the COVID-19 frontline, and 203 in regular clinical conditions. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to measure the burnout syndrome. Capacity for mentalizing was examined using the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire. The Brief Resilience Scale was used to measure resilience. The results indicated that there were negative correlations between resilience and the dimensions of burnout-emotional exhaustion (r = -0.38; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and depersonalization (r = -0.11; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), and a positive correlation between resilience and personal accomplishment (r = 0.27; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), as was expected. The analyses of hierarchical linear regression showed that hypomentalizing was a significant positive predictor of emotional exhaustion (ÃƒÅ¸ = 0.12; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 005) and depersonalization (ÃƒÅ¸ = 0.15; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), resilience was a significant negative predictor of emotional exhaustion (ÃƒÅ¸ = -0.28, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and positive predictor of personal accomplishment (ÃƒÅ¸ = 0.20; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), and that the degree of explained variance of burnout dimensions was higher when resilience and hypomentalizing were included in regression models, in addition to sociodemographic variables. The findings suggest that being a woman and working on the COVID-19 frontline implies a higher burnout, while the level of burnout decreases with better socioeconomic status and more children. Resilience, capacity for mentalizing, and burnout syndrome among HCWs are interrelated phenomena, which have important professional implications.","Safiye, VukÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, GutiÃ„â€¡, Milidrag, Dubljanin, Dubljanin, RadmanoviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116577","20220610","COVID-19 frontline; Serbia; burnout syndrome; doctors; emotional exhaustion; hypermentalizing; hypomentalizing; mental health; mentalizing; nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32696,""
"Individual Stress Burden and Mental Health in Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Moderating and Mediating Effects of Resilience","<b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic generated a significant burden on the German health care system, affecting the mental health of health care workers (HCW) in particular. Resilience may serve as an essential protective factor for individuals' well-being. <b>Objective:</b> Our objective was to identify demographic and work-related correlates of individual resilience and to investigate the association between pandemic-related stress, resilience and mental health using different resilience models. <b>Methods:</b> Our sample comprised 1034 German HCW in different medical professions who completed an online survey from 20 April to 1 July 2020. Resilience was assessed using the Resilience Scale-5 (RS-5). The pandemic-related self-reported stress burden was captured by a single item, while depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with the PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Additionally, various sociodemographic and work-related factors were assessed. <b>Results:</b> Overall, we found high levels of resilience in the sample compared to a German sample before the pandemic, which were significantly associated only with the older age of participants and having children in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Regarding mechanisms of resilience, moderation analysis revealed that low individual resilience and high pandemic-related stress burden independently contributed to both anxiety and depression symptoms while resilience additionally moderated the relationship between stress burden and anxiety symptoms. The link between self-reported stress burden and mental health symptoms was also partially mediated by individual resilience. <b>Conclusion:</b> Taken together, the findings based on the present sample during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that resilience plays a central role in the mental health of healthcare workers and that resilience-building interventions should be expanded, especially with a focus on younger employees.","Schmuck, Hiebel, Kriegsmann-Rabe, Schneider, Matthias, Erim, Morawa, Jerg-Bretzke, Beschoner, Albus, Weidner, Radbruch, Hauschildt, Geiser","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116545","20220610","COVID-19; demographics; health care; mental health; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32697,""
"Three-Questions-Method for Coping with the Emotional Burden of Nurses and Nursing Students during COVID-19","Nurses and nursing students experienced an emotional burden while working during the COVID-19 outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak three questions for nurses working under these extreme circumstances were formulated: 1. What today's events do you remember? 2. How do you feel (physically and mentally)? 3. Do you have enough support? The purpose of this study was to obtain insight into whether nurses and nursing students perceive that the use of the three-questions-method contributes to effective coping with the emotional burden during the COVID-19 outbreak. Focus group interviews were held with hospital nurses (n = 11) and nursing students with internships in mental health care (n = 2), hospital (n = 9), and homecare/nursing home care (n = 3) in September 2020 followed by twenty semi-structured interviews one year later. Almost all nurses and nursing students named factors that contributed to the emotional burden: fear, powerlessness, frustration, lack of knowledge about COVID-19, and pressure to pass the internship. Participants indicated that using the three-questions-method can help to effectively cope with the emotional burden during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using the three-questions-method offers added value in coping with emotional burden and can be used in education as well as in practice.","de Bot, de Vos","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116538","20220610","COVID-19; emotional burden; nurses; nursing students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32698,""
"The Impact of Hyper-Acute Inflammatory Response on Stress Adaptation and Psychological Symptoms of COVID-19 Patients","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection induces a significant inflammatory response that are amplified by persistent stress. The pathophysiology of mental illnesses is explored in terms of inflammatory processes. Thus, anxious, depressed, or psychotic episodes may occur as a result of metabolic and immunological imbalances, as a direct result of their effect on the central nervous system, or as a side effect of the COVID-19 medication protocols. As such, the primary objective of this research is to establish if the psychological profiles of COVID-19 patients change substantially according to illness severity. The secondary objective is to determine if particular biological inflammatory indicators are associated with anxiety, sadness, psychoticism, and paranoid ideation. A cross-sectional study was performed on 90 hospitalized patients admitted during a 3-month period in the COVID-19 unit. All patients received the COPE-60 and SCL-90R questionnaires. Clinical and paraclinical data were collected and the information was classified according to the severity of COVID-19.The hyper-acute inflammation encountered in patients with severe COVID-19 infection characterized 80.0% of patients using disengagement coping methods, significantly more than patients with mild or moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection severity (<i>p</i>-value = 0.012), respectively, 73.3% severe COVID-19 patients engaging in emotion-focused coping strategies based on the COPE-60 scale (<i>p</i>-value = 0.037). Additionally, it was determined that negative coping mechanisms (disengagement) and emotion-focused methods are independent risk factors for developing psychoticism symptoms following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the SCL-90 questionnaire (OR = 2.07; CI = 1.44-3.01), respectively (OR = 2.92; CI = 1.44-3.01). Elevated white blood cells and monocytes and inflammatory markers, such as fibrinogen, procalcitonin, IL-6, and D-dimers, were also identified as risk factors for psychoticism symptoms in multivariate analysis. It is particularly important to consider the constant mental-state evaluation in patients with severe COVID-19 that might benefit from early intervention before psychotic symptoms onset.","Papava, Dehelean, Romosan, Bondrescu, Dimeny, Domuta, Bratosin, Bogdan, Grigoras, Tigmeanu, Gherman, Marincu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116501","20220610","COPE-60; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; SCL-90R; severe infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32699,""
"Optimizing Strategies for Improving Mental Health in Victoria, Australia during the COVID-19 Era: A System Dynamics Modelling Study","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of populations and highlighted the limitations of mental health care systems. As the trajectory of the pandemic and the economic recovery are still uncertain, decision tools are needed to help evaluate the best interventions to improve mental health outcomes. We developed a system dynamics model that captures causal relationships among population, demographics, post-secondary education, health services, COVID-19 impact, and mental health outcomes. The study was conducted in the Australian state of Victoria. The model was calibrated using historical data and was stratified by age group and by geographic remoteness. Findings demonstrate that the most effective intervention combination includes economic, social, and health sector initiatives. Assertive post-suicide attempt care is the most impactful health sector intervention, but delaying implementation reduces the potency of its impact. Some evidence-based interventions, such as population-wide community awareness campaigns, are projected to worsen mental health outcomes when implemented on their own. Systems modelling offers a powerful decision-support tool to test alternative strategies for improving mental health outcomes in the Victorian context.","Vacher, Ho, Skinner, Robinson, Freebairn, Lee, Iorfino, Prodan, Song, Occhipinti, Hickie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116470","20220610","decision analysis; mental health; systems modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32700,""
"The Link between Subjective Religiosity, Social Support, and Mental Health among Young Students in Eastern Europe during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study of Poland and Ukraine","Religiousness has a positive effect on the mental health of an individual and social groups in many difficult situations. In the conducted research, we wanted to check, inter alia, whether religiosity and social support are positively related to the mental health of students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland and Ukraine. The research was conducted at a time (August 2021) when the very contagious Delta variant was spreading over Europe, and numerous pandemic-related personal restrictions and obligations (such as using facemasks in selected places, social distancing, and obligatory self-isolation of the ill or those who had contact with the pathogen) were in force in both countries. For this purpose, a representative survey was carried out using the CAPI technique on a sample of 1000 students in Poland (50% boys and 50% girls in the age range 10-19) and 1022 in Ukraine (51% boys and 49% girls in the age range 10-18). The results of the research shows that depression measured by the PHQ-9 scale was experienced by 20% of students in Poland, and 13% in Ukrainian. Anxiety, measured with the GAD-7 scale, was experienced by 9% of the Polish and 6% of the Ukrainian students.

"Disparities and Factors Associated with Coronavirus Disease-2019-Related Public Stigma: A Cross-Sectional Study in Thailand","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related public stigma is a major challenge, with scarce available evidence. This study aimed to determine the disparities and factors associated with COVID-19-related public stigma in the Thai population. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving a voluntary online survey in Thailand from 21 April 2020 to 4 May 2020. We invited 4004 participants to complete a series of questionnaires, including the validated COVID-19 public stigma scale and questions on relevant COVID-19-related psychosocial issues. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to investigate the factors associated with COVID-19-related public stigma. The prevalence of COVID-19-related public stigma was 24.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.2-26.2) for no/minimal, 35.5% (95% CI, 33.4-37.6) for moderate, and 40.3% (95% CI, 38.2-42.4) for high. We observed disparities in the prevalence of COVID-19-related public stigma according to participant characteristics and psychosocial factors. Using the no/minimal group as a reference group, the six predominant risk factors significantly associated with a moderate and high degree of COVID-19-related public stigma were middle-aged or older adults, male, divorced/widowed/separated, current quarantine status, moderate/severe fear of COVID-19, and medium/high perceived risk of COVID-19. Additional risk factors significantly related to a high degree of COVID-19-related public stigma were religion (Buddhist), region of residence (non-capital city), and exposure to COVID-19-related information. Disparities in COVID-19-related public stigma due to sociodemographic and psychosocial issues are frequent in the Thai population. To reduce public stigmatization, early identification of vulnerable groups and the development of tailored mitigation strategies should be implemented during the pandemic.","Ruengorn, Awiphan, Phosuya, Ruanta, Thavorn, Wongpakaran, Wongpakaran, Nochaiwong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116436","20220610","COVID-19; fear; mental health; perceived risk; public stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32702,""
"The Fear of COVID-19: Gender Differences among Italian Health Volunteers","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the fear of being infected was a major concern, resulting in both physical and psychological effects. Despite several studies on fear of COVID-19 in the general population, the effects on healthy volunteers who face COVID-19 on the frontlines have not yet been investigated. An online survey on specific psychological variables related to COVID-19 was administered to 720 healthy volunteers, and gender differences were investigated. The primary finding was that females showed higher scores in all dimensions assessed. A multiple linear regression conducted on both genders exhibited a similar pattern of predictors, highlighting the pivotal role of negative affect in the male group. The findings suggest that COVID-19 had significant effects on healthy volunteers, especially in the female group. Although the previous literature did not report the crucial role played by the negative affect in the male sample, these results highlight the need to deepen how both genders use different emotional strategies to cope with stressful situations.

"Companion Animals' Roles for AIDS Survivors, Mostly Aging Males, during HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 Pandemics","Long-term HIV/AIDS survivors responded online concerning their experiences during the AIDS and COVID pandemics. Recruited from web-based organizations for AIDS survivors, 147 answered questions on: frequency of experiencing stigma, isolation, aloneness, or grief/sadness; pet ownership; and sources of human support during each pandemic. Conditional inference trees were run to identify relevant demographic factors. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted to compare dog owners and cat owners. AIDS survivors reported more frequent feelings of stigma, aloneness, and sadness/grief during the AIDS pandemic than during COVID. Cat owners' sadness/grief during AIDS was greater than non-owners. During COVID, older respondents unexpectedly were less often sad/grieving than younger ones; dog owners less often felt alone and isolated than non-dog owners. Support during the AIDS pandemic retrospectively was rated better for older respondents; young gays' support was greater than young straights. During COVID, support was better for men than women. Contrastingly, women with pets felt less support than those without; men with dogs felt more support than those without. Cat owners more often felt isolated and unsupported during COVID than dog owners.

"Jeopardized mental health of children and adolescents in coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak became a worldwide pandemic in 2020. Social distancing measures, such as self-quarantine, lockdowns, and school closures, which have proven efficacy in various pandemic situations, remain in use in Korea. These measures prevented viral transmission to some extent; however, adverse effects have also resulted. First, the negative effect of social isolation on mental health is evident. This influences the psychiatric milieu of parents and children directly and indirectly. The most stressful factor among Korean youth was the restriction of outdoor activities. Increasing parenting burden result in increased screen time among youth, and social isolation created depressive mood with symptoms similar to those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anxiety. Second, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and somatization are prevalent among children and adolescents. The sense of threatened health and life during the pandemic, one symptom of PTSD, is a strong risk factor for somatization. Finally, the increased pattern of child abuse in pandemic indicates increased levels of emotional/psychological abuse and non-medical neglect. Social isolation makes people less aware of these events. Because pediatricians evaluate pediatric patients and their families, they should regularly assess emotional/stress factors, especially when somatization is prominent during the pandemic, and cautiously recommend that families seek advice from mental health professionals when warranted. Primary physicians must understand the characteristics and aspects of child abuse in the COVID-19 pandemic, make efforts to identify signs of child abuse, and deliver accurate information and preventive strategies for child abuse to caregivers, thereby functioning as a professional guardian. To promote the mental health of parents and children during the COVID-19 pandemic, more research and cooperation among health professionals, families, governments, and schools are needed in the future.","Jin, Lee, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2021.01753","20220610","Anxiety; Child abuse; Covid-19; Depression; PTSD; Somatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32705,""
"Loneliness associates strongly with anxiety and depression during the COVID pandemic, especially in men and younger adults","Loneliness is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), and likely also with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is unclear if these associations are moderated by age, sex, or genetic susceptibility for MDD. We included 75,279 individuals from the Lifelines COVID-19 study, a longitudinal study of a Dutch population-based cohort. Participants completed up to sixteen digital questionnaires between March 2020 and January 2021, yielding a total of 616,129 observations. Loneliness was assessed with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, and MDD and GAD with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. We used generalized estimating equations to investigate the association between loneliness and MDD and GAD, and whether this association varied across time, age, sex and MDD polygenic risk. Loneliness was strongly associated with all MDD and GAD outcomes. Individuals with the highest loneliness scores were around 14 times more likely to have MDD, and 11 times more likely to have GAD, compared to individuals who reported the least loneliness. The association between loneliness and MDD symptoms was stronger in men, younger individuals, and increased across time. While MDD polygenic risk predicted MDD and GAD outcomes, we did not find an interaction effect with loneliness. Our study, which is the largest to date, confirms that loneliness is an important risk factor for MDD, GAD, depressive and anxiety symptoms, especially in men and younger individuals. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms of these associations and explore loneliness-based interventions to prevent and treat MDD and GAD.","Steen, Ori, Wardenaar, van Loo","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13049-9","20220610","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32706,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression, anxiety, loneliness, and satisfaction in the German general population: a longitudinal analysis","Cross-sectional studies found high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, and loneliness during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported increases were lower in longitudinal population-based findings. Studies including positive outcomes are rare. This study analyzed changes in mental health symptoms, loneliness, and satisfaction. Respondents of the German Socio-Economic Panel (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6038) were surveyed pre-pandemic (2017/2019) and during the first (June 2020) and second wave (January and February 2021) of the pandemic. Self-report screeners assessed depression and anxiety symptoms, loneliness, life and health satisfaction. Difference scores were analysed using ANCOVAs focusing on time, gender, age groups. Depression and anxiety symptoms and health satisfaction increased from pre-pandemic to the first wave, but declined in the second pandemic wave. Loneliness increased and life satisfaction decreased during the first and the second wave of the pandemic. Young adults and women reported more distress and loneliness, even after controlling for pre-pandemic scores, education, and income. All effects remained stable when controlling for self-reported previous diagnosis of depression or region of residence. Increases and decreases in mental health symptoms and health satisfaction showed little variation. Of concern are the strong increases of loneliness and decreased life satisfaction being important targets for interventions. Main risk factors are young age and female gender.","Hettich, Entringer, Kroeger, Schmidt, Tibubos, Braehler, Beutel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02311-0","20220610","COVID-19 pandemic; Depression and anxiety symptoms; General population; Life and health satisfaction; Loneliness; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32707,""
"Altered mental distress among employees from different occupational groups and industries during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","Mental distress (MD) of employees from the financial, public transport, public service, and industrial sector was examined in a cross-sectional study during the second COVID-19 wave in Germany and retrospectively at its beginning. MD in terms of anxiety and depression symptoms was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. High and potential occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection risk (OSIR) was defined based on job information from 1,545 non-healthcare workers. The risks for more severe MD symptoms increased threefold and twofold, respectively, among employees with high and potential OSIR compared with employees without OSIR. MD severity differed by the extent of work-privacy conflicts, perceived job protection, interactions with colleagues, and overcommitment. Reducing COVID-19 exposure through workplace protective measures, strengthening interactions among colleagues, and supporting employees with work-privacy conflicts could help better protect employees' mental health.","Casjens, Taeger, BrÃƒÂ¼ning, Behrens","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002595","20220609","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-11","",32708,""
