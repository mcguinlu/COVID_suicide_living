"PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING CONFINEMENT OF COVID-19: INTEGRATIVE REVIEW","BACKGROUND: Many governments implemented social distancing and confinement measures due to the pandemic situation caused by COVID-19. These proved to be effective in stopping the virus spread, however, the measures had a strong impact on people's lives by modifying their lifestyles. OBJECTIVE: To identify the changes that occurred in the population's practice of physical activity by the world population of over 12 years old, during confinement by COVID-19 in the period from January to July 2020. METHODOLOGY: An integrative review of the literature was performed in the databases: Pubmed, CINAHL, Cochrane, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cuidatge and Cuiden. The search included articles published between November 2019 and December 2020. RESULTS: Finally, 24 articles were selected for full review. These articles were classified in 5 dimensions: physical activity, diet, physical health, mental health and social isolation. DISCUSSION: It is suggested that some of the assumptions that were held in relation to the practice of physical activity prior to confinement have been modified, creating new schemes and paradigms that can contribute to the development of new models for the promotion of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential that governments, institutions and health professionals work together to develop plans and strategies to promote the practice of regular physical activity. As nurses, our intervention is essential in this area, instructing the population on the importance of maintaining healthy lifestyles, and encouraging them to put them into practice, especially in situations such as those experienced during confinement.","Novella, A.

"THE EFFECT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON TURKISH WELL TRAINED CYCLIST'S PRE-COMPETITION ANXIETY LEVEL","Aim. The aim of this study is to examine national team level Turkish cyclist's pre competition anxiety level before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods. Study held on the Turkish cyclists who is racing in international level. A total of 31 riders with mean age 18.25 +/- 1.87;length 169.45 +/- 7.73 cm and weight 61.18 +/- 6.59 kg. In the study, the Turkish version of the ""Sport Competition Anxiety Test-SCAT"" developed by Rainer Martens in 1977 was used. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the difference between the socio-demographic characteristics and SCAT scores of cyclist. Statistical significance was accepted as p &lt;.05. Results. According to the findings, there is small difference between the anxiety scores of the cyclists before and after the pandemic, but it was no significant. It was concluded that the pandemic process did not statistically increase the anxiety of cyclists. In addition, it was found that there was no significant difference between the pre competition anxiety levels before and after the pandemic in terms of gender, category, economic level, education level, mother's education level, place of residence variables and specialty. Conclusion. As a result, it was found that the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant effect on the racing anxiety of well-trained cyclists. This result shows that the competition anxiety level of experienced athletes who have been cycling for at least 6 years and the passivity during the five-six-month pandemic period do not affect the competition anxiety levels of the athletes. However, considering the possibility of prolongation of the pandemic process, research on this issue should continue in the long term.","Akgonul, E.

"Immediate Effects of COVID-19 Outbreak on Psychiatric Outpatients: Post-traumatic Stress and Influencing Factors","Objective: Immediate effects of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on psychiatric patients are unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and public health measures on the psychological well-being of patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed 436 outpatients recruited from a tertiary psychiatry clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, nearly 1 month after the government introduced strict measures of lockdown against the ongoing outbreak. Respondents completed a web-based survey on sociodemographic data, subjective sleep quality, and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Respondents reported high frequencies of clinically significant post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (32.6%, Impact of Events Scale-Revised score = 33), anxiety (36.4%, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety score &gt; 10), and depression symptoms (51%, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score &gt; 10). In total, 20.5% of respondents described that their psychological status worsened during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, and 12.1% of respondents described poor or very poor sleep in the prior month. Positive predictors of increased post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms included chronic medical diseases, knowing someone in the social vicinity diagnosed with the coronavirus disease 2019 infection, job loss or being on temporary leave after the outbreak, and increased exposure time to television or social media. In contrast, male gender, older age, higher educational attainment, and psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia, and (to a lesser degree) bipolar disorder were the negative predictors. Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are prone to substantial psychological distress during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, and various individual, behavioral, and social factors mediate this effect.","Poyraz, B.

"Stress and coping in times of pandemic: Longitudinal follow-up of a group of medical patients","The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health and medical care of patients with pre-existing conditions. We longitudinally evaluated perceived stress, psychological distress, and coping strategies in 50 patients with medical diseases, finding that, 6 months after baseline evaluation, perceived stress and psychological distress were increased, and that less use was made of active coping strategies. Age (younger patients), previous psychological problems, and altered medical treatments emerge as risk factors. Proactive detection of psychopathological suffering is essential to prevent a parallel mental health pandemic from unfolding. Covid-19 has had an impact on patients with medical diseases, expressed in increased psychological vulnerability that may interfere in their disease course. While telematic monitoring is an important factor in reducing impact, early detection of psychopathological symptoms is crucial to ensuring adherence to treatments and to developing effective biopsychosocial approaches.","Maestre-Loren, F.; Lopez-i-Martin, X.; Castillo-Garayoa, J.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic: Effects of optimism and uncertainty on distress during the lockdown in Spain","The objective of this study is to make a quick assessment of the psychological resources and emotional distress of the general population locked down during the COVID-19 pandemic (in Catalonia, Spain), and to observe their evolution over the course of two waves during lockdown: at two weeks and at one month (April 1th to 3th and April 17th to 19th). The longitudinal study collected data from 29,231 participants aged 18 or older through an online platform who answered questions which evaluated: optimism, uncertainty, perceived competence, self-efficacy, emotional distress, current job situation, sadness and anger in conjunction with sociodemographic variables. The main results indicated that general beliefs about the future, uncertainty, and optimism, together with beliefs about one's own conduct, such as perceived competence when facing the situation or self-efficacy to maintain routines, could predict the emotional distress experienced by an individual. A clear gender pattern was found. Between the two waves, optimism, perceived competence to manage the situation and self-efficacy to maintain routines decrease, uncertainty grows, and emotional distress remains. Taking these results into account we can prevent possible emotional scars and offer coping strategies to overcome the pandemic and the future situations of confinement in a more efficient way.","Fernandez-Castro, J.; Cladellas, R.; Gomez-Romero, M.

According to the results of the regression analysis, fear of COVID-19 explains 23.1% of the total variance in the mania state. In addition, female bipolar disorder patients were found to have a greater fear of COVID-19 than men. Discussion: As a result of this study, it was revealed that the manic symptoms of bipolar disorder patients reduced the fear of COVID-19. In this process, detailed scans and interventions for this diagnostic group will be important.","Corum, E.

"Caregivers and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Through the Covid-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic has carried a high number of deaths worldwide. Most of those who died were older adults, especially who previously suffered from health problems. This population are more vulnerable, especially during the expansion and subsequent pandemic by COVID-19. Since higher levels of distress, anxiety and depression were observed among caregivers of dementia patients and Alzheimerâ€™s disease individuals, we may be able to prevent or reduce the harm of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers.","Altable, M.; de la Serna, J.

"The Experience of Stigma in Nurses on the Early Spread of the COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Nurses are at the forefront of handling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and have a significant risk in handling the disease. The rapid transmission of the virus causes nurses to experience various mental health problems and stigma in performing their duties. AIM: This study explored mental health conditions and the stigma of nurses at the forefront of handling the COVID-19. METHODS: This research was a qualitative study with 17 nurses serving in hospitals and health centers in various provinces in Indonesia. The data analysis of this research employed a descriptive analysis technique. RESULTS: The data analysis revealed four themes: Nurses carrying out their duties as a professional call, psychological and physical responses as a reaction to work stress, stigma due to running a profession, and social support as a reinforcement for carrying out their duties. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that nurses require protection and guarantees for the work risk and the stigma consequences from the community.","Wardani, I.

"The Moderating Influence of Religiousness/Spirituality on COVID-19 Impact and Change in Psychotherapy","The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a global surge in empirical research examining the influence of the pandemic on individuals' mental health symptoms and well-being. Within this larger literature is a rapidly growing literature on the associations among religiousness/spirituality, COVID-19 impact, symptoms and well-being. Largely absent from this literature is a specific research focus on psychotherapy clients, and the influence of religiousness/spirituality and COVID-19 impact on change during treatment. One prominent theory in the existing literature centers on the notion that religiousness/spirituality is a coping resource for individuals during times of adversity. Yet, existing empirical findings present mixed evidence for the religious/spiritual coping hypothesis. We expanded upon these emerging research trends to examine the influence of religious/spiritual struggles, religious/spiritual commitment, religious/spiritual exploration, and COVID-19 impact ratings on psychotherapy change in a sample of adult clients (N = 185;Mage = 38.06;SD = 15.78;range = 19&ndash;81;61.1% female;69.7% White). The results of latent trajectory analysis identified three subgroups that differed on initial levels of symptoms and well-being and the nature of change over three time points. The COVID-19 impact ratings predicted change trajectories. As more positive ratings of COVID-19 impact increased, membership in the no change trajectory was more likely relative to the deterioration trajectory at high levels of both religious/spiritual commitment and exploration. The implications emphasize the need for judicious assessment of religiousness/spirituality and COVID-19 impact before integrating religiousness/spirituality into treatment.","Jankowski, Peter J.; Sandage, Steven J.; Crabtree, Sarah A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13060488","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(6):488, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32834,""
"COVID-19 Induced Taste Dysfunction and Recovery: Association with Smell Dysfunction and Oral Health Behaviour","Background and Objectives: Disruption to taste and smell are common symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The current literature overlooks taste symptoms and tends to focus on the sense of smell. Persisting cases (&gt;28 days) of taste dysfunction are increasingly recognised as a major future healthcare challenge. This study focuses on the severity and recovery of COVID-19 induced taste loss and association with olfactory symptoms, lifestyle and oral health factors. Materials and Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey comparing 182 rapid taste recovery participants (&le;28 days) with 47 participants with prolonged taste recovery &gt;28 days. Analyses of taste loss in association with smell loss, age, sex, illness severity, diet, BMI, vitamin-D supplementation, antidepressants, alcohol use, smoking, brushing frequency, flossing, missing teeth, appliances and number of dental restorations were conducted. Differences in the severity of the loss of sour, sweet, salt, bitter and umami tastes were explored. Results: Both the severity and the duration of taste and smell loss were closely correlated (p &lt; 0.001). Salt taste was significantly less affected than all other taste qualities (p &lt; 0.001). Persisting taste loss was associated with older age (mean &plusmn;95% CI = 31.73 &plusmn;1.23 years vs. 36.66 &plusmn;3.59 years, p &lt; 0.001) and reduced likelihood of using floss (odds ratio &plusmn;95% CI = 2.22 (1.15&ndash;4.25), p = 0.047). Conclusions: Smell and taste loss in COVID-19 are closely related, although a minority of individuals can experience taste or smell dysfunction in the absence of the other. The taste of salt may be less severely affected than other taste qualities and future work exploring this finding objectively is indicated. The association of flossing with rapid taste recovery adds to the growing evidence of a link between good periodontal health and favourable COVID-19 outcomes.","Catton, Georgia, Gardner, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58060715","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(6):715, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32835,""
"Human-Nature Interactions during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic in Moscow, Russia: Exploring the Role of Contact with Nature and Main Lessons from the City Responses","Urban green spaces (UGS) as essential elements of the urban environment provide multiple ecosystem services including benefits for physical and mental health. Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions have influenced human relationships with nature. Based on empirical research, this article explores the pathways and implications of human-nature interactions during and after COVID-19 and how human health and well-being could be supported by contact with nature. The article discusses the reasons that attract people to visit UGS (value of UGS, their perceptions, ways of contact with urban nature, etc.). It also analyses the effects of social isolation on the usage and perception of UGS during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The research revealed current needs for UGS and their role in adaptation of urban development and greening strategy. For this purpose, an online questionnaire survey among residents of Moscow was conducted in April&ndash;July of 2020 when restrictive measures were imposed in the city in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, non-participatory observations and photo documentation were used to supplement the data on UGS visitation and use. The GIS mapping method was applied to analyze the UGS provision (availability and accessibility of UGS). Moreover, expert interviews were conducted aiming to explore the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban fabric and life of the citizens. The aim was to reveal the main tendencies that can be used in the adaptation of urban development plans, especially regarding UGS and human-nature interactions. The results show that citizens (both survey respondents and experts) highly value urban nature as a tool for coping with COVID-19 challenges. They underlined a need for accessible UGS, most notably for breathing fresh air, reducing stress, relaxing, and observing and enjoying nature. The survey also revealed the particular health effects resulting from the reduction of UGS visitations due to COVID-19 restrictions. Several changes in human-nature interactions were also observed: many respondents especially missed spending time outdoors and meeting other people. That highlights the fact that while UGS normally provides places for social integration and socializing, during the COVID-19 isolation UGS were especially valued in regard to physical health and well-being (self-recovery). Both respondents and experts expressed their opinions regarding the future development of UGS network and how the UGS's structure and design should be adapted to the current challenges. The claimed interests/preferences included the need for providing all residents equal access to UGS in a time of pandemics and post pandemics. A set of limitations and directions for future research of UGS was suggested.","Dushkova, Diana, Ignatieva, Maria, Konstantinova, Anastasia, Vasenev, Viacheslav, Dovletyarova, Elvira, Dvornikov, Yury","https://doi.org/10.3390/land11060822","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Land; 11(6):822, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32836,""
"Urgent Biophilia: Green Space Visits in Wellington, New Zealand, during the COVID-19 Lockdowns","Urgent biophilia describes the conscious desire of humans to seek interactions with nature during periods of stress. This study examines the changes in frequency and reason for visiting urban green spaces by residents of Wellington, New Zealand, to determine whether resident behavior during a stressful period exemplifies the principles of urgent biophilia. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns were used as the study period due to the significant physical and mental health stressors they triggered. Pedestrian and cyclist counters located in key urban green spaces in Wellington were used to collect data on visits pre- and post-pandemic. Two surveys were used to assess residents' reasons for visiting urban green spaces during lockdowns. Increased green space visits were seen during the strictest lockdowns, though there was some variation in visits depending on the location of the green space. The most frequently reported reason for visiting green spaces during lockdown was mental wellbeing, followed by recreation. These results suggest that Wellington residents used urban green spaces as a coping mechanism during stressful lockdown periods for wellbeing benefits, exemplifying the principles of urgent biophilia. Urban planners and policymakers must consider and implement urban green infrastructure as a public health resource.","MacKinnon, Maggie, MacKinnon, Rebecca, Pedersen Zari, Maibritt, Glensor, Kain, Park, Tim","https://doi.org/10.3390/land11060793","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Land; 11(6):793, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32837,""
"Emotional Reaction to the First Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine: Postvaccination Decline in Anxiety and Stress among Anxious Individuals and Increase among Individuals with Normal Prevaccination Anxiety Levels","Although vaccination has been adopted by the WHO to limit worldwide transmission of COVID-19, people's worries about COVID-19 vaccines may suppress their desire for vaccination despite vaccine availability. This study aimed to investigate anxiety and stress symptoms among 250 Jordanians (mean age = 43.18 &plusmn;6.34 years, 72% females) who received their first vaccine dose. The respondents completed the anxiety and stress subscales of the Depression Anxiety and Stress scale 21 (DASS-21) before and after vaccination. The respondents expressed more moderate&ndash;severe levels of stress before than after vaccination (20.8% and 13.2%, respectively). Meanwhile, 37.2% and 45.2% of the respondents expressed moderate&ndash;severe anxiety before and after vaccination, respectively. Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that the drop in the level of stress from before- (median (IQR) = 5 (1&ndash;8)) to after vaccination (median (IQR) = 3 (1&ndash;7)) was statistically significant (z = &minus;3.81, p = 0.001, r = 0.17) while the increase in anxiety was not. Anxiety significantly dropped postvaccination among individuals experiencing mild to severe anxiety before vaccination. Similarly, stress and anxiety significantly increased among individuals expressing normal anxiety before vaccination (z = &minus;3.57 and &minus;8.24, p values = 0.001, r = 0.16 and 0.37, respectively). Age positively correlated with postvaccination anxiety among respondents with mild prevaccination anxiety, and it negatively correlated with the prevaccination level of stress in the normal-anxiety group. Gender, marital status, respondents' level of education, and history of COVID-19 infection had no significant correlation with anxiety or stress at either point of measurement. Overcoming their hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccines, individuals with normal levels of anxiety experienced a rise in their distress symptoms following immunization. On the contrary, vaccination seemed to desensitize anxious individuals. Policymakers need to formulate a population-specific plan to increase vaccine preparedness and promote psychological well-being over all during the pandemic.","Al-Amer, Rasmieh, Malak, Malakeh Z.; Burqan, Hala Mohammad Ramadan, Stanculescu, Elena, Nalubega, Sylivia, Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A.; Hendawy, Amin Omar, Ali, Amira Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12060912","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(6):912, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32838,""
"Systematic Review of Mind&ndash;Body Modalities to Manage the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Era","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have suffered physical and psychological threats since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Mind-body modalities (MBMs) can reduce the long-term adverse health effects associated with COVID-specific chronic stress. This systematic review aims to investigate the role of MBMs in managing the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comprehensive search was conducted using 6 electronic databases, resulting in 18 clinical studies from 2019 to September 2021. Meta-analysis showed that MBMs significantly improved the perceived stress of HCWs (standardized mean difference, &minus;0.37;95% confidence intervals, &minus;0.53 to &minus;0.21). In addition, some MBMs had significant positive effects on psychological trauma, burnout, insomnia, anxiety, depression, self-compassion, mindfulness, quality of life, resilience, and well-being, but not psychological trauma and self-efficacy of HCWs. This review provides data supporting the potential of some MBMs to improve the mental health of HCWs during COVID-19. However, owing to poor methodological quality and heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes of the included studies, further high-quality clinical trials are needed on this topic in the future.","Kwon, Chan-Young, Lee, Boram","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061027","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(6):1027, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32839,""
"Determinants of Outpatient Physician Visits in the General Adult German Population during Later Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The goal of this study was to investigate the determinants of outpatient physician visits in Germany during the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data were used from the general adult population in Germany with n = 3091 individuals (data collection in mid-March 2022). Determinants were selected based on the extended Andersen model. The number of GP visits as well as the number of specialist visits in the past 12 months were used as outcome measures. Negative binomial regressions showed that the number of GP visits was positively associated with a lower educational level, being retired, lower levels of loneliness, the presence of at least one chronic condition, lower self-rated health, being vaccinated against COVID-19, and the presence of depression. Moreover, negative binomial regressions showed that the number of specialist visits was positively associated with being female, a lower age, having children, being married, not being full-time employed, the presence of at least one chronic condition, lower self-rated health, the presence of depression, being vaccinated against COVID-19 and having a lower coronavirus anxiety. In conclusion, while our study showed that need factors are still a main driver of outpatient physician visits, our findings additionally showed that predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and psychosocial factors are also important for the number of outpatient physician visits in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about these determinants (e.g., vaccination status, loneliness or coronavirus anxiety) is also important to avoid under- or overuse of the healthcare system.","Hajek, AndrÃ©, KÃ¶nig, Hans-Helmut","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061025","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(6):1025, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32840,""
"Decision Conflicts in Clinical Care during COVID-19: A Patient Perspective","(1) Background: Uncertainty is typical for a pandemic or similar healthcare crisis. This affects patients with resulting decisional conflicts and disturbed shared decision making during their treatment occurring to a very different extent. Sociodemographic factors and the individual perception of pandemic-related problems likely determine this decisional dilemma for patients and can characterize vulnerable groups with special susceptibility for decisional problems and related consequences. (2) Methods: Cross-sectional data from the OnCoVID questionnaire study were used involving 540 patients from 11 participating institutions covering all major regions in Germany. Participants were actively involved in clinical treatment in oncology or psychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Questionnaires covered five decision dimensions (conflicts and uncertainty, resources, risk perception, perception of consequences for clinical processes, perception of consequences for patients) and very basic demographic data (age, gender, stage of treatment and educational background). Decision uncertainties and distress were operationalized using equidistant five-point scales. Data analysis was performed using descriptive and various multivariate approaches. (3) Results: A total of 11.5% of all patients described intensive uncertainty in their clinical decisions that was significantly correlated with anxiety, depression, loneliness and stress. Younger and female patients and those of higher educational status and treatment stage had the highest values for these stressors (p &lt; 0.001). Only 15.3% of the patients (14.9% oncology, 16.2% psychiatry;p = 0.021) considered the additional risk of COVID-19 infections as very important for their disease-related decisions. Regression analysis identified determinants for patients at risk of a decisional dilemma, including information availability, educational level, age group and requirement of treatment decision making. (4) Conclusions: In patients, the COVID-19 pandemic induced specific decisional uncertainty and distress accompanied by intensified stress and psychological disturbances. Determinants of specific vulnerability were related to female sex, younger age, education level, disease stages and perception of pandemic-related treatment modifications, whereas availability of sufficient pandemic-related information prevented these problems. The most important decisional criteria for patients under these conditions were expected side effects/complications and treatment responses.","Haier, JÃ¶rg, Beller, Johannes, Adorjan, Kristina, Bleich, Stefan, De Greck, Moritz, Griesinger, Frank, Hein, Alexander, Hurlemann, RenÃ©, Mees, SÃ¶ren Torge, Philipsen, Alexandra, Rohde, Gernot, Schilling, Georgia, Trautmann, Karolin, Combs, Stephanie E.; Geyer, Siegfried, SchÃ¤fers, JÃ¼rgen","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061019","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(6):1019, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32841,""
"Students' Mental Health, Well-Being, and Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-National Study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, much research has been devoted to assessing mental health in a variety of populations. Students in higher education appear to be particularly vulnerable to experiencing reduced mental health. The purpose of the study was to assess whether higher education students experienced poorer mental health compared to the general population and examine the factors associated with students' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-national sample of students (n = 354) and non-students (n = 3120) participated in a survey in October/November 2020. Mental health outcomes among students and non-students were compared with independent t-tests. Multiple linear regression analysis and general linear estimation were used to assess the impact of student status on mental health outcomes while adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Students reported poorer mental health than non-students. The difference in mental health between students and non-students was bigger for participants aged 30 years or older. More social media use was associated with poorer mental health outcomes. In conclusion, students had poorer mental health than the wider population. Aspects of life as a student, beyond what can be attributed to life stage, appears to increase mental health problems.","Bonsaksen, Tore, Chiu, Vivian, Leung, Janni, Schoultz, Mariyana, Thygesen, Hilde, Price, Daicia, Ruffolo, Mary, Geirdal, Amy Ã˜stertun","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10060996","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(6):996, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32842,""

"Pedagogy in Health Promotion: The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Paper of the Year Award","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) realities have demanded that educators move swiftly to adopt new ways of teaching, advising, and mentoring. We suggest the centering of a trauma-informed approach to education and academic administration during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration?s (SAMHSA) guidance on trauma-informed approaches to care. In our model for trauma-informed education and administration (M-TIEA), SAMHSA?s four key organizational assumptions are foundational, including a realization about trauma and its wide-ranging effects;a recognition of the basic signs and symptoms of trauma;a response that involves fully integrating knowledge into programs, policies, and practices;and an active process for resisting retraumatization. Since educators during the pandemic must follow new restrictions regarding how they teach, we have expanded the practice of teaching in M-TIEA to include both academic administrators? decision making about teaching, and educators? planning and implementation of teaching. In M-TIEA, SAMHSA?s six guiding principles for a trauma-informed approach are infused into these two interrelated teaching processes, and include the following: safety;trustworthiness and transparency;peer support;collaboration and mutuality;empowerment, voice, and choice;and cultural, historical, and gender issues. M-TIEA?s organizational assumptions, processes, and principles are situated within an outer context that acknowledges the potential influences of four types of intersectional traumas and stressors that may occur at multiple socioecological levels: pandemic-related trauma and stressors;other forms of individual, group, community, or mass trauma and stressors;historical trauma;and current general life stressors. This acknowledges that all trauma-informed work is dynamic and may be influenced by contextual factors.","","https://doi.org/10.1177/23733799221099923","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pedagogy in Health Promotion; 8(2):165-165, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32844,""

A web survey was conducted between July 3?August 3, 2020, across Canada. The main outcomes considered were a positive screening for depression, as evaluated by the PHQ-2 and positive screening for anxiety, as evaluated by the GAD-7. Lifestyle behaviors were assessed using the Short Multidimensional Lifestyle Inventory Evaluation?Confinement (SMILE-C), an instrument adapted for lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The total sample size included 404 participants, of which 24.3% had a positive screen for depression, 20.5% for anxiety, and 15.5% for both. We found significant differences in SMILE-C scores between individuals with a positive and individuals with a negative screen for depression (P &lt; .001). Likewise, there were significant differences in SMILE-C scores between individuals with a positive and individuals with a negative screen for anxiety (P &lt; .001). We found an association between unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 lockdown in Canada.

The essay invites questions about the ways syllabi operate as crisis management strategies and how they sometimes succumb to the very dynamics they aspire to address.","Hamera, Judith","https://doi.org/10.1177/15327086221090654","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cultural Studies <U+2194> Critical Methodologies;: 15327086221090654, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32846,""
"COVID Issues: Impact on Families and Family Planning","In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, many changes occurred worldwide to policies that influence an individual's reproductive autonomy and families? wellbeing. Specifically, many reproductive treatments including abortions, contraceptive procedures, infertility treatments, and pregnancy protocols were delayed or altered in an attempt to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

"COVID Check-In: Optimizing Cleft & Craniofacial Team Care during COVID-19 using an on-line social pediatrics screening instrument","Background/Purpose: The public health mandates associated with COVID-19 to decrease transmission in children and youth added unprecedented stress on families, providers and health care systems, including ambulatory multidisciplinary cleft/craniofacial team care. In order to provide responsive, multidisciplinary team (MDT) cleft and craniofacial care, it was essential to identify direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on our patients and families, whilst planning ahead for ongoing coordinated surgical, pediatric, and psychosocial interventions. The purpose of this Platform presentation is to discuss how incorporating a short on-line psychosocial screening questionnaire prior to a MDT clinic, using a 'What Matters to You' quality improvement (QI) format, can facilitate care coordination and responsiveness, triage for in-person and virtual care settings, and respond to family centred care priorities in the midst of evolving COVID-19 landscapes. Methods/Description: Description - During this platform paper, the interdisciplinary team coordinator and/or pediatrician from a large North American multidisciplinary Cleft Craniofacial Program will present the key findings from a quality improvement project conducted during the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. The use of a smart phone accessible data system to record QI data will also be discussed. Main Objectives of Presentation - At the end of this presentation, the learner will list 5 key psychosocial screening questions to triage patients in need of addition supports exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Care coordinators will discuss key findings and the application of similar approaches in other team settings to address direct and indirect care needs exacerbated by COVID-19 and its aftermath. Key Findings and Insights - Out of 110 sequential MDT visits, families reported that COVID impacted timely access to health services (20%);employment (32%);basic needs like food and shelter (13%);and social capital. Almost half (47%) reported less than 5 people to turn to for extra support. The most common concerns caregivers reported about their children were development, learning, and/or school progress (38%);mental health (36%) and social emotional well-being (31%).","Loock, C.; Robertson, S.; Fisher, E.; Szostek, L.; Ponton, E.; Lau, W.; Courtemanche, D.; Henkelman, E.","https://doi.org/10.1177/10556656221079212","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal; 59(4 SUPPL):60-61, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32848,""
"â€œWill My Young Adult Years be Spent Socially Distancing?â€: A Qualitative Exploration of Adolescentsâ€™ Experiences During the COVID-19 UK Lockdown","For older adolescents, the COVID-19 pandemic and UK restrictions arrived during a critical period in the transition to adulthood. Early research exploring impact of the pandemic paints a picture of worsened adolescent wellbeing and mental health. We explore the subjective experiences of 16- to 19-year-olds during the first UK lockdown, with an emphasis on wellbeing and coping, to complement quantitative evidence and inform strategies and provision for support. In May 2020, we invited UK-based 16- to 19-year-olds to share written accounts of their experiences of the initial UK lockdown for The TELL Study. A total of 109 participants engaged, submitting anonymous written accounts via an online survey portal. We used inductive reflexive thematic analysis to develop rich experiential themes. We constructed seven main themes: heightened emotionality;feelings of loss, change, and uncertainty;recognizing the value of self-care;efforts to think positively;opportunities for relief, growth, and development;the importance of togetherness;and frustration with government and media. Findings highlight the multifaceted nature of adolescents? lockdown experiences, and offer insight into emotional impact and new concerns alongside the value placed on self-care and staying connected. We offer directions for supporting adolescents as pandemic consequences continue.","Demkowicz, Ola, Ashworth, Emma, Oâ€™Neill, Alisha, Hanley, Terry, Pert, Kirsty","https://doi.org/10.1177/07435584221097132","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Research;: 07435584221097132, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32849,""
"Development of Ethical COVID-19 Antibody Testing that Adheres to Pro-Life Principles","The use of cell lines derived from elective abortions in the development and production of COVID vaccines was opposed by the Catholic church who encouraged pharmaceutical companies and governmental health agencies to produce and distribute ethical vaccines that do not create problems of conscience for healthcare providers or those requiring vaccination. In response to the church?s call for ethical alternatives in research and development of COVID vaccines, we present an approach for the measurement of Anti?SARS-CoV-2 Ig antibodies in blood plasma (COVID-19 Antibody test) that does not utilize any products produced in aborted fetal cell lines. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein used in this test was produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and test performance for determination of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion was equivalent to a commercially available COVID-19 antibody test that utilized RBD protein and other reagents produced in embryonic cell lines.","Rohall, Michael, Kissinger, Daniel, Evans, Matthew, Wright, Elizabeth, Nick, Evelyn, Calkins, Monica, Burton, David, McKenna, Kyle C.","https://doi.org/10.1177/00243639221095906","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Linacre Quarterly;: 00243639221095906, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32850,""
"Remaining Hopeful During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of NGOs in Filling the Social Support Gap for Vulnerable Children","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on children?s mental health worldwide. Existing studies suggest that children with greater levels of hope are more likely to be resilient in the face of disaster. While social support at the family and community level is proposed as an important factor in sustaining and fostering hope, the children of underprivileged households in developing countries tend to lack this support. We investigate whether development projects run by international NGOs are able to fill this gap and help children to remain hopeful during the pandemic. Using original survey data from 834 children in adolescence (aged between 10 and 18) in Kenya and Zambia, we show that children participating in Good Neighbors? child sponsorship programs and community development projects exhibit higher scores on the Children?s Hope Scale than do non-participating children. These projects appear to foster hope by providing emotional and informational support.","Lim, Sijeong, Moon, Chungshik, Kim, Youngwan","https://doi.org/10.1177/0044118X221098449","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Youth & Society;: 0044118X221098449, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32851,""
"Three-Phase Methodology to Manage the COVID-19 Information for Classification of Mental Illness","In the COVID-19 era, the use of social media platforms has significantly increased leading to misinformation being produced whose management is quite necessary for the domain experts, such as the Reddit social platform where people disseminate extensive information about their health issues using relevant posts and comments. The management of misinformation about COVID-19 impact on mental illness could be quite beneficial for the domain experts. In this regard, we proposed a two-step methodology which could aid domain experts to manage and group the posts and comments information with respect to COVID-19 impact on mental illness. First, we extract the information of well-known mental illnesses (such as depression, anxiety, OCD and PTSD) from the Raddit platform. Second, we leverage the capabilities of unsupervised learning algorithms and text categorisation approach to manage the information. We also proposed the evaluation model to assess the efficacy of the proposed method according to expert opinion. The experimental results indicate the efficacy of the proposed method.

"EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Purpose of Study Emergency department (ED) visits for mental health (MH) concerns have increased over the past decade. While a sharp decrease was noted in overall ED volume at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of visits for MH concerns was significantly higher compared to previous years. The objectives of this study were to assess the proportion and acuity of MH visits in the ED for patients aged 5-21 during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous three years. Methods Used A retrospective, cohort study was conducted in a suburban ED with 130,000 annual visits (2019) that includes a dedicated pediatric ED. Data was retrieved from the hospital's electronic medical records searching for MH chief complaints. Proportion of MH visits during the COVID- 19 pandemic year (Y4: March 1, 2020- February 28, 2021) was compared to the previous three rolling years (Y1: 2017- 18;Y2: 2018-19;Y3: 2019-20). Patients with substance abuse/ intoxication were excluded. High acuity was defined as patients presenting after intentional ingestion of a substance, direct physical harm requiring medical hospitalization, or presenting under an emergency/temporary custody order. Acuity was assessed through random sampling of each cohort. Outcomes were stratified by age: 5-13, 14-17, 18-21. Chi-square methods (including exact tests) were used to evaluate all frequency measures. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (v9.4, SAS Institute). Summary of Results During Y4, 1677 patients aged 5-21 with a MH chief complaint were identified, of whom 1505 patients met inclusion criteria. The proportion of ED visits for mental health concerns was 8.8%, compared with 4.25%, 5.07%, and 5.43% for Y1-Y3, respectively (p&lt; 0.0001). The median age was 16 years, 74.3% were female, and 33.3% presented with high acuity. There were no statistically significant differences in overall acuity when compared to prior years. However, for the cohort aged 14-17 years, the proportion presenting with high acuity increased from Y1 to Y4 with a clinically significant increase from Y3 (14.1%) to Y4 (18.7%). Conclusions The proportion of MH encounters to the ED increased significantly during the pandemic year. Additionally, we saw a clinically significant increase in patients aged 14-17 presenting with high acuity.

"THEME-CODED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND PARENTAL PERCEIVED STRESS AND DEPRESSION IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT","Purpose of Study Parents of infants admitted to NICUs often experience significant psychosocial stress and have higher risks for depression, anxiety, and disturbed parent-child bonding. Analyses of parental stress often use either a predominantly biomedical or qualitative approach. The current study integrates these domains, using parental demographic and psychosocial assessments, stress-related salivary biomarkers, measures of illness severity, and open-ended question interviews for a more complete assessment of parental NICU experience and stressors. We detail a novel use of theme-coded qualitative analysis of open-ended interviews to explore parents' perceptions of the NICU experience, sources of stress and well-being, and associations with stress/depression measurements. Methods Used Inclusion criteria: parents of infants admitted to a Level IV NICU born Â£34 weeks gestation or having a predicted length of stay &gt;2 weeks. At weeks 1 and 6 and before discharge, we collected parental salivary cortisol and a-amylase (AM, PM) and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Social Provisions Scale. Infant data and the Neonatal Acute Physiology Perinatal Extension-II and Neonatal therapeutic Intervention Scoring System were recorded. Parents individually participated in recorded openended question interviews. Interviews were transcribed and annotated using qualitative content analysis based on a grounded theory approach. Investigators affixed codes (with inter-rater checks) to transcripts using an iterative approach, highlighting common phrasing and themes. Transcripts were entered into NVivo qualitative data analysis software to sort and label categories and themes. Summary of Results Results are available for 15 interviews. We identified patterns, themes, subgroup differences, and common phrasing to develop an interactive model of the complex interplay among social supports, NICU environment, COVID- 19-related stressors, and parental experience [figure]. The model facilitates evaluating multiple components which influence parental experience and clarifies parental-perceived barriers and facilitators. Voiced resiliency was compared to subjects' stress and depression salivary biomarkers and the validated scales. Conclusions Parent interviews revealed feelings of isolation, fear, and resilience among NICU parents. Textual analysis of open-ended interviews informed construction of a conceptual model describing the NICU experience. Integration of biomedical and qualitative methods more comprehensively reveals experiences of parents and points to strategies for fostering support and resilience.","Ressel, C.; Wolfe, J.

"CHARACTERISTICS OF POST-ACUTE SEQUELAE OF COVID-19 (PASC) IN PEDIATRICS","Purpose of Study A subset of children and adolescents who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 can experience recurrent or persistent symptoms beyond the typical recovery period. The constellation of findings that occur post-infection is known Post-Acute Sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC). Relatively little is known about this condition in the pediatric population. This study aimed to explore the clinical spectrum and outcomes of children and adolescents diagnosed with PASC within a large healthcare system. Methods Used In this cross-sectional study, encounter- and patient-level data were extracted from the electronic health records (EHR) of patients &lt;21 years who had at least one health care visit between 5/1/21 and 9/30/21 in an ambulatory site affiliated with the Yale-New Haven Health System. Individuals with a PASC-associated encounter were identified using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes, the standard for encoding patient conditions in the EHR. Free-text data fields denoting the 'reason for visit' were also queried to optimize case-finding. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographics, clinical characteristics, and management of pediatric patients with PASC. Summary of Results During the study period, there were 66,590 pediatric patients with an encounter in the health system, of which 1,520 had a Covid-19-related encounter diagnosis, and 37 had PASC. The mean age for PASC was 16 years (Â± 4), and 65% were female. Most identified their race/ ethnicity as either White (59%), Black (5%), or Hispanic (32%). The most common comorbidities included atopy (32%), asthma (22%), and obesity (12%). Approximately 28% of children diagnosed with PASC had no prior medical history, and 30% were previously active in sports before Covid- 19. In the acute phase of the disease, most (88%) had a mild illness, and only 12% required hospitalization. The median time between acute Covid-19 and their PASC encounter was 3 weeks (IQR 1-5). The most prevalent symptoms are shown in figure 1. Patients with PASC had a mean follow-up of 2.6 months. Medical utilization was high, with an average of 3 medical encounters per patient (range 1-12). Most (75%) had minimal to no limitations in daily functioning, though at least 5% experienced severe limitations and reported high rates of school absenteeism. Out of the 31 patients screened for depression, 8 (26%) tested positive. Cardiology and pulmonology evaluated 72% and 48% of PASC cases, respectively, yet only 8% found abnormalities in their work-up. Conclusions This study highlights the wide range of clinical symptoms children and adolescents can experience post-Covid- 19. PASC can occur even after mild SARS-COV-2 infections and may lead to severe limitations. To better understand the true risk SARS-CoV-2 poses to children, more research is needed to quantify the long-term outcomes of infection and the impact PASC has on quality of life.

"UNIVERSAL SUICIDE SCREENING IN A PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS FEASIBLE: EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC","Purpose of Study Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for youth age 10-24 in the United States. Suicide rates in youth have been climbing over the last decade, and focus on prevention should be a priority. Implementation of universal suicide risk screening in pediatric emergency departments (PED) may provide early detection and intervention for at risk youth. Methods Used This retrospective chart review study examined youth =10 years old presenting to the PED. Records from 09/2019-08/2021 were searched to determine suicide risk using a validated suicide screening tool by nursing staff. Data were described with appropriate summary statistics (e.g., proportions) and compared by relevant covariates (e.g., gender) with appropriate test statistics including chi square and z-test analysis. Summary of Results Over a 2-year period, 31,344 children between the ages of 10-21 presented to the PED. Of those patients, 26,992 (86%) were screened for risk of suicide, which did not show a significant change during the pandemic (table 1;Z=-0.52, p=0.61);minimum compliance rate was 83.8% and maximum was 89.4%. Of those screened, 5039 (19%) of patients screened positive for suicide risk;1738 (7%) had a medical chief complaint which was significantly lower compared to 3077 (11%) that had a behavioral health chief complaint (c [1, n=22889] = 6273.2, p&lt; 0.001). Females had a significant association with positive screens (<U+03C7>[1, n=26992] = 9.3, p=0.002). Non-Hispanic or Latino patients also had a significant association with positive screens <U+03C7> [1, n=26992] = 79.9, p&lt; 0.001. Conclusions Universal suicide risk screening for youth is feasible in a PED. This was demonstrated by higher-than-expected rates of staff compliance with completing universal suicide screening. There has been no significant change in screening compliance rates during the COVID pandemic. Suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors were prevalent in a significant proportion of children presenting to the PED with both medical and behavioral health chief complaints. Identifying all at risk youth and providing them with appropriate resources may improve patient safety.

"Relationship quality and support for family policy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective We examined how relationship satisfaction changed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as how relationship satisfaction related to public policy support. Background Conservation of resources (COR) theory suggests that societal-level stressors (such as a global pandemic) threaten familial and individual resources, straining couple relationships. Relationship satisfaction is in turn linked with important individual, familial, and societal outcomes, necessitating research on how COVID-19 impacted this facet of relationships. Method Drawing from an international project on COVID-19 and family life, participants included 734 married and cohabiting American parents of children under 18?years of age. Results Findings revealed relationship satisfaction declined moderately compared to retrospective reports of relationship satisfaction prior to the pandemic. This decline was more precipitous for White individuals, women, parents less involved in their children's lives, and those reporting higher levels of depressive symptoms. We also found that higher relationship satisfaction was associated with higher levels of support for family policy, particularly for men. At higher levels of relationship satisfaction, men and women had similarly high levels of support for family policy, while at lower levels, women's support for family policy was significantly higher. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic likely amplified facets of social inequality, which is especially concerning when considering the large socioeconomic gaps prior to the pandemic. Implications Therapists, researchers, and policy makers should examine how relationship satisfaction may have changed during the pandemic because relationship satisfaction is linked to child and adult well-being and relationship dissolution. Further, the link between relationship satisfaction and support for family policy deserves further scrutiny.","James, Spencer, Ben Brik, Anis, Jorgensen-Wells, McKell, Esteinou, Rosario, Acero, IvÃ¡n DarÃ­o Moreno, Mesurado, BelÃ©n, Debeliuh, Patriccia, Orellana, Olivia NuÃ±ez","https://doi.org/10.1111/fare.12705","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Family Relations; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32857,""
"Diabetes self-management during the covid-19 pandemic and its associations with covid-19 anxiety syndrome, depression, and health anxiety","Objective: The effects of the covid-19 pandemic on mental health have been profound. There is a complex bi-directional relationship between mental health and diabetes self-care. We examined whether covid-19 anxiety syndrome, depression and health anxiety predicted domains of diabetes self-management and investigated whether greater covid-19 anxiety syndrome would independently contribute to poorer diabetes self-care. Methods: We sent surveys to patients attending a London hospital diabetes clinic. Participants (n = 369, mean age 50.5 years, 52.9% female) completed the diabetes self-management questionnaire (DSMQ), the covid-19 anxiety syndrome scale (C-19ASS), which measures perseveration and avoidant maladaptive coping behaviour, assessed with measures of co-existent depression and health anxiety, controlling for age, gender, and social deprivation. Clinical data including pre-and post-lockdown HbA1c measures were obtained from hospital records. Results: Depression scores were much higher than pre-pandemic reports, although the prevalence of covid-19 anxiety syndrome was not higher than measured elsewhere. Both pre-existing health anxiety and depression independently predicted poorer measures of diabetes care, as did lower socioeconomic rank. However, avoidant covid-19 anxiety responses were independently associated with higher diabetes self-care scores. HbA1c levels improved significantly over the UK lockdown in our cohort (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: During the height of lockdown our research suggests that avoidant coping behaviours characteristic of the covid-19 anxiety syndrome could work to improve diabetes self-care, at least in the short term. We recommend screening for depression, and we should be aware of the significant minority of patients with covid-19 anxiety syndrome who may now find it difficult to re-engage with face-to- face clinic opportunities.","Semere, S.; Malik, M.

"THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND THEMATIC SYNTHESIS OF QUALITATIVE STUDIES AND A REVIEW OF ONLINE FORA","Background/Aims Psychological distress is prevalent in people with inflammatory arthritis. In populations with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), the risk of developing mental ill-health is high - for depression more than twice that of control populations. Positive emotions are protective against psychological distress and emotional wellbeing is favourably associated with physical illness prognosis. However, the emotional experiences of people who live with axial SpA are not well understood. This study aimed to explore and synthesise qualitative data about the emotional experience of living with axial SpA and identify barriers and facilitators to emotional wellbeing. Methods First, a systematic review and thematic synthesis was conducted. Nine databases were searched from inception to December 2019. Qualitative and mixed methods studies were included if they reported qualitative participant level data about the lived emotional experiences of people with axial SpA and were published in English or German. The search was updated in March 2021. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative tool. Grey literature was appraised using the Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance (AACODS) checklist. Data were extracted, coded and categorised. Synthesis involved translation of concepts from one study into another and development of descriptive themes. Second, four axial SpA online forums were searched from inception to June 2020 for posts from UK-based individuals with axial SpA containing data about their emotional experiences of axial SpA. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Results Of 10,824 database records screened, 27 studies, published between 1995 and 2020, went forward for synthesis. Study populations included people diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (n=1143), axial SpA (n=53) and non-radiographic axial SpA (n=18). Two studies with mixed populations (n=37) did not specify numbers diagnosed with axial SpA. Most participants were male and had established disease. No studies specifically focused on the psychological experiences of living with axial SpA. 537 posts were identified from online fora, 278 (52%) of which were from men. Seven descriptive themes were generated from the qualitative synthesis: delayed diagnosis: a barrier to emotional wellbeing;disruptive symptoms: a source of mood swings;work disability: a loss of self-esteem;obstacles in interpersonal relationships: a trigger of distress;taking up exercise: 'personal pride' or 'unwelcomed reminders';anti-TNF therapy: hope reignited despite concerns;journey of acceptance: worry mixed with hope. The findings from our review of online fora supported and validated these themes. One additional theme - COVID-19: uncertainty and anxiety during the pandemic - was developed from constructs identified from online posts. Conclusion Our findings highlight substantial negative and mixed emotions experienced by people with axial SpA. However, data about the emotional experiences of women, people diagnosed with non-radiographic axial SpA, and those in the early stages of diagnosis, are limited.","Wilson, N.; Liu, J.; Adamjee, Q.; Di Giorgio, S.; Steer, S.; Lempp, H.","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keac133.249","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Rheumatology (United Kingdom); 61(SUPPL 1):i137-i138, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32860,""
"MEETING THE DEMANDS OF EMPLOYMENT: THE IMPACT AND REHABILITATION OF CHRONIC PAIN AND FATIGUE IN THE UK ARMED FORCES","Background/Aims The growing prevalence of chronic pain and the recent influx of postviral fatigue (due to COVID-19) will limit the working output of the UK population. As such presentations become more common, the ability of the working population to meet the demands of their employment will depend on the effective management of chronic pain and fatigue. We investigated the working ability and outcomes of UK military personnel two years after rehabilitation for persistent pain or fatigue. Methods We collected the health data of 35 personnel presenting with primary persistent pain, fibromyalgia, or persistent fatigue during admission to the 2-week Specialist Rehabilitation Course at DMRC between November 2018 to December 2019. Participants scored their current ability to work and the work-related impact of their symptoms by completing a follow-up survey. This group also evaluated the efficacy of 14 evidence-based rehabilitation tools provided during their rehabilitation programme based on how they improved their ability to work. Results 88.2% of attendees had a history of mental health issues, whilst 82.4% had other medical comorbidities. Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel predominantly presented with fatigue rather than pain;this subgroup left the armed forces two years earlier than the service average. 62.9% of attendees responded to our survey. 63.6% of respondents no longer served in the military two years after their initial admission to the rehabilitation course. All current military personnel reported either 'good' or 'very good' symptom management and as a cohort reported better work outcomes than those who had left the military. Respondents reported mindfulness, activity pacing and education about symptoms as the most effective strategies for improving work capability. Those who found these strategies most useful had the best outcomes. 7 of the 8 retained military personnel found at least two of these strategies useful for improving their work ability compared to 4 of the 14 military leavers. Conclusion Poor working ability due to persistent pain or fatigue was not compatible with sustained military employment. Yet, the tools provided at DMRC improved the ability to work for those remaining in the military. Military personnel with persistent pain and fatigue benefitted most from mindfulness, activity pacing and education. Response to these specific strategies corresponded with both continued military service and better work capabilities. These findings are consistent with the recent literature regarding the efficacy of these rehabilitation strategies for persistent pain and fatigue. The occupational outcomes of military personnel in this study may be comparable to that of civilian populations;specifically sectors with similar demands or mental health risks as the armed forces.","Chisala, E.; Bahadur, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keac133.175","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Rheumatology (United Kingdom); 61(SUPPL 1):i102, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32861,""
"LONG COVID IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR MENTAL HEALTH IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATIC DISEASE: RESULTS FROM A 14-MONTH LONGITUDINAL STUDY","Background/Aims COVID-19 has had severe consequences across the globe and the detrimental impacts are continually emerging. Recently it has been recognised that some patients develop persisting symptoms past the initial infection, termed 'long-COVID'. The prevalence of long-COVID in the general population is estimated to range from 2.3% to 37.7% and while risk factors in this group have been explored, there is a lack of data reporting prevalence and risk factors of long-COVID in patients with rheumatic disease (RD). This is an interim report of an ongoing study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04542031) exploring COVID19 in patients with RD;we report risk factors for the development and impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of long-COVID in patients with RD to inform guidelines and target service provision as the pandemic continues. Methods We distributed three web-based surveys spanning 14 months, April 2020 to June 2021. Surveys were communicated via a linked SMS-text message;all patients with a validated mobile-number under rheumatology follow-up at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust were invited to participate in survey-1, those that consented were invited to participate in follow-up surveys. Patients reported a range of metrics including demographics, and self-reported COVID-status;on completion patients were asked to complete a validated HRQoL survey, the short-Form 12 encompassing physical (PCS), and mental component (MCS) scores. Data were collected 7-days following survey distribution. SPSS version-27 was used for comparative data analysis. Results Initial surveys were sent to 7911 active follow-up patients, 1636/7911 (21%) responded and consented to further follow-up;628/1636 (38%) responded to all surveys. 45/628 (7%) reported contracting COVID at any time (59years, female-80%, BAME-9%). 26/45 (58%) suffered acute-COVID (symptoms &lt;4weeks), and 19 (42%) suffered long- COVID (symptoms 4 weeks or more);10/19 (53%) had post-COVID syndrome (symptoms 12 weeks or more). Compared to the acute- COVID group more in the post-COVID syndrome group were female (69% vs 100%), BAME (4% vs 20%), housebound due to prepandemic ill-health (5% vs 60%), and needed regular assistance (7% vs 60%). While baseline MCS did not differ, after 14months, compared to the acute-COVID group MCS was significantly worse in those that developed post-COVID syndrome (43.2 vs 35.8) and more in this group reported visiting their GP due to mental health concerns (7% vs 30%). Age, diagnosis, and PCS were similar across groups. Conclusion These data highlight that in RD patients those at risk of developing post-COVID syndrome are females, those with worse pre-pandemic health, and BAME-groups. While physical health remained stable, following infection the mental health of patients that developed post- COVID syndrome was significantly worse than those that suffered COVID acute-COVID. These data can be used to identify COVIDpositive patients at greater risk of developing post-COVID syndrome and suggest services need to adapt to support psychological wellbeing in these groups.","Cox, N.; Raizada, S.

"PATIENT WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ON REGULAR RITUXIMAB INFUSIONS WITH SEVERE COVID-19 PNEUMONITIS DESPITE BOTH VACCINATIONS","Background/Aims Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). International mass vaccination schemes are implemented to control the disease and reduce mortality. The data on serological immune response among rheumatology patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is very sparse. We present a case of a rheumatoid arthritis patient receiving rituximab (RTX) who developed fatal nosocomial COVID-19 infection despite receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods A 71-year-old Caucasian male with longstanding seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial lung disease with bullous emphysema, paraproteinemia, osteoporosis, anxiety, and depression. His treatment included hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, oral prednisolone (2- 5 mg), and RTX every 6 months. He received his last cycle of RTX almost 8 weeks before vaccination. This gentleman received two doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (BioNTech-Pfizer) eleven weeks apart. Nine weeks after the second vaccination he was admitted with supraventricular tachycardia and heart failure. This admission coincided with a COVID-19 outbreak in the ward. Eight patients and one staff member tested (PCR) positive during regular ward screening. All patients were initially asymptomatic, and six of them were fully vaccinated. He was allowed to go home with advice to self-isolate for 10 days. Two days after discharge, he presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, lethargy, and cough. The diagnosis was COVID-19 pneumonitis and pre-renal acute kidney injury. He received supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone, and intravenous co-amoxiclav. Unfortunately, he died from COVID-19 pneumonitis on his sixth day of admission. Our patient was the only one among the nine SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals who developed symptomatic disease. Results It is known that RTX along with other immune modulatory drugs reduce the response to some vaccines such as the seasonal flu vaccine, and it is expected that the same effect could be seen after COVID-19 vaccination. Octave study is evaluating immune responses in patients with a range of chronic rheumatic conditions on specific immunomodulatory and biologic treatments. This has shown the response to vaccine was dependent on the disease cohort, with 90% of those with RTX-treated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)- associated vasculitis and 54% of those with inflammatory arthritis responding less well than the baseline for healthy subjects. There is no evidence to suggest how long after RTX a patient should delay vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine, but published consensus suggests 4-8 weeks. Conclusion More studies are needed to assess the response to SARS-COV-2 vaccines among immunocompromised patients and the need for a third vaccine dose if antibodies level were low. The first approved monoclonal antibody treatment-Ronapreve for treating and preventing acute covid-19 in adults, is a promising drug for poor vaccine responders who develop COVID-19 infection. This case also highlights the importance of infection control within hospital setting.","Abdullah, N.; Kinder, A.; Jenkins, D.; Patel, V.","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keac133.072","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Rheumatology (United Kingdom); 61(SUPPL 1):i56, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32863,""
"IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF PEOPLE WITH INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS: THE ICEPAC SURVEY","Background/Aims Concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection led to guidelines advocating shielding for many people with inflammatory conditions. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the self-reported physical and mental health of people with inflammatory conditions. Methods 2024 patients with inflammatory conditions (RA, PsA, AS, SLE and other) were randomly selected from electronic health records. Survey invites were sent (August 2021 to coincide with relaxation of COVID restrictions) using a combination of SMS and postal approaches. Data collected included demographics, COVID infection and shielding status, physical (MSK-HQ) and mental health (PHQ8 and GAD7) and global impact on physical or mental health (4 options: none-severe). Ethical approval was obtained (REC Ref 21/PR/0867). Results 639 people completed the survey, of whom 287 (44.9%) completed online. Mean (sd) age was 64.5 (13.1) years and 384 (64.7%) were female. The majority of people had RA although 57 (9%) reported more than one inflammatory condition. 349 (57.9%) of people were advised to shield. Rates of COVID infection were relatively low across the groups (Table 1). 254 (41.2%) reported moderate or severe impact of the pandemic on physical health, which impacted least in people with RA. 244 (39.4%) reported moderate or severe impact of the pandemic on mental health with 175 (28.7%) reporting moderate depression (PHQ8&gt;10) and 138 (22.6%) moderate anxiety (GAD-7=10). Conclusion Reported COVID infections were low in our cohort. The pandemic had significant effects on physical and mental health, which appeared less in people with RA than other inflammatory conditions.","Hider, S.; Muller, S.; Gray, L.; Manning, F.; Brooks, M.; Heining, D.; Menon, A.; Packham, J.; Raghuvanshi, S.; Roddy, E.; Ryan, S.; Scott, I.; Paskins, Z.","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keac133.063","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Rheumatology (United Kingdom); 61(SUPPL 1):i51-i52, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32864,""
"New York City School Social Workers in a Pandemic: Lessons Learned from COVID-19","During the beginning stages of COVID-19, school social workers in New York City (NYC) were at the forefront of managing the mental health of youth and families. There were multiple barriers that interfered with the level of care that school social workers wanted and needed to provide to both students and their families. This article is an NYC school social worker's firsthand account of how she and her collaborative team managed the mental health of NYC students and families. Specifically, this article addresses suicidal ideation and suicidality in adolescents during the pandemic. This article also addresses the disparities and recommendations for further access to mental health care in NYC's racially and socioeconomically diverse school communities. The article recommends both micro and macro changes that can be implemented to better address the acute crisis and long-term trauma implications for this population. Finally, this article makes recommendations for furthering social work educational practices to better train clinicians to handle future crises.","Chock-Goldman, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/cs/cdac010","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children & Schools;: 5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32865,""
"Agree to Disagree? Equianalgesic Consensus Amongst Hospice and Palliative Providers","Background: Chronic pain affects more than 100 million Americans, and opioids used for pain are 85-95% effective when administered for the right patient in the right dose at the right time. Conversions between opioids and routes of administration may be necessary due to pill burden, organ dysfunction, effectiveness, or insurance coverage. Although multiple opioid conversion tables exist, a universally accepted opioid analgesic conversion table does not. OhioHealth's Hospice and Palliative Medicine (HPM) teams utilize an HPM opioid conversion table, but consensus is not yet established. The goal of this study is to determine if there is consensus regarding the HPM opioid conversion table amongst the OhioHealth HPM pharmacists, physicians, and nurse practitioners. Methods: REDCap distributed a survey used to determine if there is consensus regarding the HPM opioid conversion table and to describe consensus differences between healthcare professionals. Data is summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, ranges, counts, and percentages. Consensus is achieved if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is greater than 70%. Secondary analyses are completed using descriptive statistics. Results: Forty-two of 53 HPM pharmacists (3), physicians (26), and nurse practitioners (15) responded to the survey. Consensus was reached for 60% (3) of the opioid conversion ratios surveyed. The majority of those surveyed (59.1%) reported utilizing the HPM conversion table with reasons being practice expectation (50%), ease of memorization (43.2%), evidence-based ratios (36.4%), and good clinical outcomes (43.2%). None of those surveyed reported an adverse effect attributed to the conversion ratios. Conclusion: Although consensus was not reached for two conversion ratios tested, consensus was reached for the remaining ratios. Notably, none of the HPM providers experienced an adverse effect, including respiratory depression, attributed to the conversion ratios. Reasons stated for not using the HPM conversion rations were unfamiliarity, difficulty understanding and/or using the ratios, and lack of evidence. Of the 11 respondents that did not use the HPM table, the majority reported 5 years or less of experience within hospice and palliative medicine. Additional education pertaining to evidence for the ratios and discussions regarding concerns may be necessary to reach consensus on all conversion ratios. Although the Delphi method may have been more appropriate to determine consensus, it was not feasible to execute it properly during the current coronavirus pandemic. A more standardized approach to opioid conversions could be established when there is consensus, with the goal of leading to minimization of adverse events resulting from under-and over-estimating opioid dose conversions.","Aung, L.; Petros, T.; Geiger, J.; Graham, S.","https://doi.org/10.1080/15360288.2021.1981059","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pain and Palliative Care Pharmacotherapy; 35(4):228, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32866,""

"Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Children and Families in PICU Follow-Up Clinic","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted the lives of many families, especially those of children with chronic health problems. Little is known about the impact of this pandemic on the health and well-being of critically ill children and their families after their discharge from pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) hospitalization. This study describes the repercussions of the COVID-19-related lockdown on the physical and psychological wellbeing, quality of life, and access to resources of PICU survivors and their families. This was a prospective cohort study of children and families followed at the Centre Hospitaller Universitaire Ste-Justine PICU follow-up clinic from October 2018 to February 2020. There were no interventions. Families were contacted by phone to complete validated questionnaires (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their access to medical care and extrafamilial support. Fifty-five families were contacted between November and December 2020. Quality of life scores were 88.1 +/- 16.9 and 83.8 +/- 13.9 for physical and psychosocial aspects, respectively. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were detected in 23.6 and 3.6% of respondent parents, respectively. A significant proportion of families reported canceled or delayed health care appointments (65.5%) and difficulty with medication access (12.7%). Twenty-five families (45.5%) reported a significant decrease in income. We could not identify any statistically significant predictors for lower quality of life scores. Difficulty accessing medical care was associated with higher symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in parents on multivariate analysis (p = 0.02).

"The COVID-19 pandemic and mental disorders in minors","The psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children are evident. Psychosocial burdens increase the risk for psychiatric disorders, but it is not a disorder for itself. Risk factors for psychiatric disorders within and after the pandemic are the same as before the pandemic: poverty, low educational status, psychiatric disorders of parents. For children who suffer on a psychiatric disorder, the pandemic may have worsened symptoms or social participation. The pandemic illustrated weaknesses within health and social welfare systems in Germany. Whereas numerous studies have been published on short term effects on mental health, long-term studies and studies on at-risk populations are needed. Mental health of children is one of the major public health issues in Germany - even after the pandemic. Health care system can react on increased demands for care by transition to more flexible treatment offers.

"Inequalities of extreme commuting across Canada","There is growing body of research and practice assessing transportation equity and justice. Commuting is an especially important dimension to study since such frequent, non-discretionary travel, can come at the expense of time for other activities and therefore negatively impact mental health and well-being. An â€extreme commuterâ€ is a worker who has a particularly burdensome commute, and has previously been defined based on one-way commute times above 60 or 90 minutes. In this paper, we examine the social and geographic inequalities of extreme commuting in Canada. We use a 25% sample of all commuters in Canada in 2016 (nÂ =Â 4,543,417) and our analysis consists of descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. The average one-way commute time in 2016 across Canada was 26 minutes, but over 9.7% of the workforce had commute times exceeding 60 minutes. However, this rate of extreme commuting was 11.5% for low-income households, 13.5% for immigrants, and 13.4% among non-white Canadians, reaching as high as 18.6% for Black Canadians and 14.7% for Latin American Canadians specifically. We find that these inequalities persist even after controlling for household factors, commute mode, occupation, and built environment characteristics. The persistently significant effects of race in our models point to factors like housing and employment discrimination as possible contributors to extreme commuting. These results highlight commuting disparities at a national scale prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and represents clear evidence of structural marginalization contributing to racialized inequalities in the critical metric of daily commute times seldom recognized by Canadian scholars and planners.","Allen, Jeff, Palm, Matthew, Tiznado-Aitken, Ignacio, Farber, Steven","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2022.05.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Travel Behaviour and Society; 29:42-52, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32871,""

Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the organization of work and represented a turning point in the deployment of mediated and remote work. Wherever the continuation of the activity was possible at a distance, telework was imposed. Nevertheless, it is exercised in new conditions and the organization of work modalities is defined according to the evolution of the situation and governmental health measures. Objective In this context, the objective of this study is to understand what are, from the point of view of middle managers, the impacts of telework in confinement and then during the progressive re-establishment of the activity on site, on the one hand, on the work, its organization and its conditions of realization and, on the other hand, on the work collectives, the relationship to work and the quality of life of the employees. Method In this perspective, we carried out an exploratory and comprehensive study through semi-structured interviews with 17 directors of service in a French public organization. Results The lexical and morphosyntactic analysis performed shows that the modalities of work organization/reorganization at different moments of the crisis, their impact on work activity, the psychosocial experience of telework within the services and the managerial practices deployed (3 classes) could constitute opportunities but also generate risks. Conclusion The results of this study allow us to identify the benefits but also the potentially deleterious effects of the use of telework in times of crisis and provide elements for consideration in its post-pandemic deployment.","Gachet-Mauroz, T.; Cros, F.; Maillot, A.

"Cross-sectional study of pain-related variables before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with COPD","Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the pain-related variables before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in COPD patients. Methods In this cross-sectional case-control study, stable COPD patients without a COVID-19 diagnosis were evaluated before and during the pandemic. The main outcomes were the pronociceptive pain profile (general pain sensitivity, pain intensity, pain interference, and pressure pain sensitivity) and the psychological vulnerability (perceived health status, anxiety, and depression). Results Our results showed that COPD patients during COVID-19 pandemic experienced higher general pain sensitivity and intensity with statistical differences in pain interference (p&lt;0.001), being the overall perceived health status lower than before the pandemic (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion We concluded that COPD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a rise the pronociceptive pain profile accompanied by increased psychological vulnerability.","Santiago, MarÃ­a Granados, NÃºÃ±ez, Javier MartÃ­n, CiurÃ³, Alejandro Heredia, Rubio, Araceli Ortiz, Mateo, AndrÃ©s Calvache, LÃ³pez, Laura LÃ³pez, Valenza, Marie Carmen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmn.2022.05.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pain Management Nursing;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32873,""
"QualitÃ© de vie et pandÃ©mieÂ ?Â Impact des mesures restrictives liÃ©es Ã  la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 sur la qualitÃ© de vie des patients vivants avec le VIH (PVVIH)","Introduction Les mesures sanitaires franÃ§aises liÃ©es Ã  la gestion de la pandÃ©mie de covid 19 dont les confinements en 2020 et 2021 ont pu avoir un impact chez les patients vivants avec le VIH (PVVIH). L'objectif de cette Ã©tude Ã©tait de recueillir le ressenti des PVVIH durant cette pÃ©riode au moyen d'autoquestionaires. MatÃ©riels et mÃ©thodes Il s'agissait d'une Ã©tude prospective, interventionnelle, multicentrique. De janvier 2021 Ã  janvier 2022, les PVVIH suivis dans 3 centres hospitaliers et disposant d'une adresse email dans leur dossier mÃ©dical NADISÂ®, ont Ã©tÃ© invitÃ©s Ã  complÃ©ter tous les mois un questionnaire en ligne (plateforme LimesurveyÂ®) qui comportait des donnÃ©es socio-professionnelles et mÃ©dicales. Lors de leur consultation de suivi dans le service, les PVVIH participants Ã  l'Ã©tude Ã©taient invitÃ©s Ã©galement Ã  complÃ©ter le questionnaire Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) et le questionnaire de qualitÃ© de vie PROQOL-HIV (Patient Reported Outcome Quality Of Life, HIV). RÃ©sultats Au total, 391 patients ont Ã©tÃ© inclus dans l'Ã©tude avec une prÃ©valence de COVID-19 de 5.9Â %, similaire Ã  celle de la population gÃ©nÃ©rale. Le taux mÃ©dian de CD4 Ã©tait de 717/mm3. La charge virale VIH Ã©tait contrÃ´lÃ©e pour 96Â % des patients. Au 11 fÃ©vrier 2022, 230 patients (58.5Â %) ont complÃ©tÃ© les questionnaires HAD et PROQOL-HIV. Concernant l'anxiÃ©tÃ© (A) sur l'Ã©chelle HAD, 49/230 (21.3Â %) ont un score A entre 8 et 10, donc un trouble anxieux suspectÃ©, et 50 (21.7Â %) un scoreÂ =Â 11 donc un trouble anxieux avÃ©rÃ©. Concernant la dÃ©pression (D), 21 (9.1Â %) ont un score D entre 8 et 10 donc une suspicion de trouble dÃ©pressif et 15 (6.5Â %) un score DÂ =Â 11, donc un trouble dÃ©pressif avÃ©rÃ©. A partir du PROQOL HIV, nous avons observÃ© que 194 patients (84.7Â %) trouvaient que leur santÃ© Ã©tait bonne/ trÃ¨s bonne. Des troubles du sommeil ont Ã©tÃ© dÃ©clarÃ©s par 20 patients (8.7Â %) et de la concentration par 18 (7.8Â %). Des troubles de la libido ont Ã©tÃ© rapportÃ©s chez 30 patients (13Â %). Neuf patient (3.9Â %) ont dÃ©clarÃ© ressentir une tristesse associÃ©e Ã  une angoisse et un sentiment de dÃ©prime. Enfin la peur d'attraper une infection Ã©tait ressentie par 64 patients (27.8Â %). Conclusion Durant la pÃ©riode Ã©pidÃ©mique de l'Ã©tude, plus de 80Â % des patients ont jugÃ© leur Ã©tat de santÃ© bon voir trÃ¨s bon. Cependant, un PVVIH sur 5 dÃ©clarait des troubles anxieux et un sur 10 des troubles dÃ©pressifs! Des troubles du sommeil, de la concentration et de la sexualitÃ© ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©galement rapportÃ©s.

"An island of sanity during COVID-19 pandemic: Does pet attachment support buffer employees' stress due to job insecurity?","Drawing on the transactional theory of stress, the current study investigates whether employee job insecurity triggers employee behavioral strain reactions (i.e., alcohol use, marijuana use, and cigarette use) and psychological strain reactions (i.e., emotional exhaustion and depression) through stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we integrate social support theory and expect the moderating role of pet attachment support in the above relationships. By collecting two-wave data from 187 employees with pets in the United States, we found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, stress mediated the relationships between job insecurity and predicted behavioral and psychological reactions. Moreover, pet attachment support buffered the relationships between stress and these behavioral and psychological strain reactions (all except cigarette use). Pet attachment support also alleviated the conditional indirect effects job insecurity had on the two types of strain reactions via stress. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this study.","Wan, Kelemen, Zhang, Matthews","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221109105","20220615","Job insecurity; behavioral strain reactions; pet attachment support; psychological strain reactions; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32875,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on physical activity and quality of life in adults with lower limb amputation","This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on ambulatory activity and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with a lower limb amputation (LLA) in Norway. We hypothesized that the restrictions would negatively affect HR-QoL and decrease prosthetic wear time and ambulatory activity in participants with already limited mobility. Twenty individuals with LLA (age and time since amputation 56.2 Ã‚Â± 11.9 and 22.3 Ã‚Â± 20.1 years, respectively) participated. Ambulatory activity (stepwatch: prosthetic wear time; steps per day; minutes of low-intensity (1-15 steps min-1), moderate-intensity (16-40 steps min-1), and high-intensity ambulation (&gt;40 steps min-1)) and HR-QoL (EQ-5D-5L) data were collected prepandemic and 8-12 months later during pandemic restrictions. Semistructured interviews identified personal experiences of coping with restrictions. Prosthetic wear time decreased significantly (-1.0 Ã‚Â± 1.5 hours day-1, p &lt; 0.05). Steps per day (440 Ã‚Â± 1481), moderate-intensity and high-intensity ambulation (3.7 Ã‚Â± 23.4, and 4.8 Ã‚Â± 13.9 minutes day-1, respectively), and EQ-5D-5L index (.02 Ã‚Â± .10) increased, whereas low-intensity ambulation decreased (-1.5 Ã‚Â± 16.1 minutes day-1), all nonsignificant changes. Qualitative analysis identified three themes related to coping with restrictions: (1) personal situation, (2) a prosthetic user's perspective, and (3) mindset. Increased time spent at home might explain the decreased prosthetic wear time. Contrary to the hypothesis, participants did not decrease their physical activity, and the declined low-intensity ambulation was offset by increased moderate-intensity and high-intensity ambulation. A positive mindset, intrinsic motivation, and health awareness may be important factors for maintaining ambulatory activity and HR-QoL in people with LLA.","Mellema, Risnes, Mirtaheri, GjÃƒÂ¸vaag","https://doi.org/10.1097/PXR.0000000000000078","20220615","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32876,""
"Estimated Prevalence of and Factors Associated With Clinically Significant Anxiety and Depression Among US Adults During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Claims of dramatic increases in clinically significant anxiety and depression early in the COVID-19 pandemic came from online surveys with extremely low or unreported response rates. To examine trend data in a calibrated screening for clinically significant anxiety and depression among adults in the only US government benchmark probability trend survey not disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey study used the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a monthly state-based trend survey conducted over the telephone. Participants were adult respondents in the 50 US states and District of Columbia who were surveyed March to December 2020 compared with the same months in 2017 to 2019. Monthly state COVID-19 death rates. Estimated 30-day prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression based on responses to a single BRFSS item calibrated to a score of 6 or greater on the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.84). All percentages are weighted based on BRFSS calibration weights. Overall, there were 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯429Ã¢â‚¬Â¯354 respondents, with 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯093Ã¢â‚¬Â¯663 in 2017 to 2019 (600Ã¢â‚¬Â¯416 [51.1%] women; 87Ã¢â‚¬Â¯153 [11.8%] non-Hispanic Black; 826Ã¢â‚¬Â¯334 [61.5%] non-Hispanic White; 411Ã¢â‚¬Â¯254 [27.8%] with college education; and 543Ã¢â‚¬Â¯619 [56.8] employed) and 335Ã¢â‚¬Â¯691 in 2020 (182Ã¢â‚¬Â¯351 [51.3%] women; 25Ã¢â‚¬Â¯517 [11.7%] non-Hispanic Black; 250Ã¢â‚¬Â¯333 [60.5%] non-Hispanic White; 130Ã¢â‚¬Â¯642 [29.3%] with college education; and 168Ã¢â‚¬Â¯921 [54.9%] employed). Median within-state response rates were 45.9% to 49.4% in 2017 to 2019 and 47.9% in 2020. Estimated 30-day prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression was 0.4 (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.7) percentage points higher in March to December 2020 (12.4%) than March to December 2017 to 2019 (12.1%). This estimated increase was limited, however, to students (2.4 [95% CI, 0.8 to 3.9] percentage points) and the employed (0.9 [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.4] percentage points). Estimated prevalence decreased among the short-term unemployed (-1.8 [95% CI, -3.1 to -0.5] percentage points) and those unable to work (-4.2 [95% CI, -5.3 to -3.2] percentage points), but did not change significantly among the long-term unemployed (-2.1 [95% CI, -4.5 to 0.5] percentage points), homemakers (0.8 [95% CI, -0.3 to 1.9] percentage points), or the retired (0.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 0.8] percentage points). The increase in anxiety and depression prevalence among employed people was positively associated with the state-month COVID-19 death rate (1.8 [95% CI, 1.2 to 2.5] percentage points when high and 0.0 [95% CI, -0.7 to 0.6] percentage points when low) and was elevated among women compared with men (2.0 [95% CI, 1.4 to 2.5] percentage points vs 0.2 [95% CI, -0.1 to 0.6] percentage points), Non-Hispanic White individuals compared with Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals (1.3 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.9] percentage points vs 1.1 [95% CI, -0.2 to 2.5] percentage points and 0.7 [95% CI, -0.1 to 1.5] percentage points), and those with college educations compared with less than high school educations (2.5 [95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1] percentage points vs -0.6 [95% CI, -2.7 to 1.4] percentage points). In this survey study, clinically significant US adult anxiety and depression increased less during 2020 than suggested by online surveys. However, this modest aggregate increase could mask more substantial increases in key population segments (eg, first responders) and might have become larger in 2021 and 2022.","Kessler, Ruhm, Puac-Polanco, Hwang, Lee, Petukhova, Sampson, Ziobrowski, Zaslavsky, Zubizarreta","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.17223","20220615","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32877,""

"The effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on mental health care use in South Africa: an interrupted time-series analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and ensuing restrictions have negatively affected the mental health and well-being of the general population, and there is increasing evidence suggesting that lockdowns have led to a disruption of health services. In March 2020, South Africa introduced a lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, entailing the suspension of all non-essential activities and a complete ban of tobacco and alcohol sales. We studied the effect of the lockdown on mental health care utilisation rates in private-sector care in South Africa. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis using insurance claims from 1 January 2017 to 1 June 2020 of beneficiaries 18 years or older from a large private sector medical insurance scheme. We calculated weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates for organic mental disorders, substance use disorders, serious mental disorders, depression, anxiety, other mental disorders, any mental disorder and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the effect of the lockdown on weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates and the weekly change in rates during the lockdown until 1 June 2020. 710 367 persons were followed up for a median of 153 weeks. Hospital admission rates (OR 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-0.44) and outpatient consultation rates (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63-0.87) for any mental disorder decreased substantially after the introduction of the lockdown and did not recover to pre-lockdown levels by 1 June 2020. Health care utilisation rates for alcohol withdrawal syndrome doubled after the introduction of the lockdown, but the statistical uncertainty around the estimates was large (OR 2.24; 95% CI 0.69-7.24). Mental health care utilisation rates for inpatient and outpatient services decreased substantially after the introduction of the lockdown. Hospital admissions and outpatient consultations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome increased after the introduction of the lockdown, but statistical uncertainty precludes strong conclusions about a potential unintended effect of the alcohol sales ban. Governments should integrate strategies for ensuring access and continuity of essential mental health services during lockdowns in pandemic preparedness planning.","Wettstein, Tlali, Joska, Cornell, Skrivankova, Seedat, Mouton, van den Heuvel, Maxwell, Davies, Maartens, Egger, Haas","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796022000270","20220615","Alcohol abuse; health service research; psychiatric hospital; psychiatric services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32879,""
"Machine learning applications for COVID-19 outbreak management","Recently, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in millions of deaths and has impacted practically every area of human life. Several machine learning (ML) approaches are employed in the medical field in many applications, including detecting and monitoringÃ‚Â patients, notably in COVID-19 management. Different medical imaging systems, such as computed tomography (CT) and X-ray, offer ML an excellent platform for combating the pandemic. Because of this need, a significant quantity of study has been carried out; thus, in this work, we employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to cover all aspects of outcomes from related papers. Imaging methods, survival analysis, forecasting, economic and geographical issues, monitoring methods, medication development, and hybrid apps are the seven key uses of applications employed in the COVID-19 pandemic. Conventional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoencoders, random forest, and other ML techniques are frequently used in such scenarios. Next, cutting-edge applicationsÃ‚Â related to MLÃ‚Â techniques for pandemic medical issues are discussed. Various problems and challenges linked with ML applications for this pandemic were reviewed. It is expected that additional research will be conducted in the upcoming to limit the spread and catastrophe management. According to the data, most papers are evaluated mainly on characteristics such as flexibility and accuracy, while other factors such as safety are overlooked. Also, Keras was the most often used library in the research studied, accounting for 24.4 percent of the time. Furthermore, medical imaging systems are employed for diagnostic reasons in 20.4 percent of applications.","Heidari, Jafari Navimipour, Unal, Toumaj","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-022-07424-w","20220615","Applications, COVID-19; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Outbreak","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32880,""

"Prevalence of Anxiety, Depression, and Sleep Disturbances Associated With the COVID-19 Outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Background COVID-19 became a global respiratory pandemic as it disrupted millions of lives and commerce. The implementation of strict lockdown measures to confine the outbreak can negatively affect people's overall sleep quality and mental health. We aimed to assess the prevalence of sleep disturbance and the psychological impact associated with the spread of COVID-19 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Ã‚ Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A nationally online questionnaire was sent to participants aged &gt;18 years to assess their socio-demographic information, assessment of psychological status by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and assessment of sleep disturbance by Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scales.Ã‚ Results The total sample consisted of 399 participants. The mean age was 34.70 Ã‚Â± 12.57Ã‚Â years; predominant responses were from females (69.4%). The study sample was mostly made up of students (32.1%), and more than half of the participants (52.6%) were married. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia was 38.6%, 33.1%, and 54.9%, respectively.Ã‚Â Participants with comorbidities were significantly at higher risk of having symptoms of depression in comparison to subjects free from chronic diseases (OR=2.19 95% Cl: 1.24-3.86, p=001).Ã‚ Conclusion These findings suggest that the prevalence of poor sleep quality and worsening mental health in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia was high during the COVID-19 lockdown, which articulates the requirement for raising the awareness, screening, and management of worsening sleep quality and mental health due to the unwholesome effect they may have on the individual's health.","Alkahtani, Alomar, Alkanhal, Alhinti, Alatoui, Alrashidi, Saleh","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.24838","20220615","anxiety; anxiety scale; covid-19; depression; insomnia; insomnia scale; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32882,""

"COVID-19 related psychological burden and potential benefits of vaccination - Data from a repeated cross-sectional survey in healthcare workers","The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the psychological well-being, especially of health care workers, for nearly two years now. Here, we followed-up on a survey we conducted at the very beginning of the pandemic, to determine potential changes in psychological strain experienced by health care workers one year later. Since our first survey in 2020, COVID-19 vaccines have been established, thus we assessed whether vaccination-status might modulate psychological burden of health care workers. We also collected data on resilience and sleep, as those might be related to successful coping. Between March and April 2021, nurses and physicians (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯286) working at the University Hospital Augsburg - with high or low exposure to COVID-19 patients - took part in an online survey. We found that fully vaccinated personnel reported lower levels of anxiety, depression, stress and exhaustion suggesting the potential positive consequences of vaccination beyond the obvious protection against a COVID-19 infection. Nurses reported more depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress and exhaustion and lower levels of job fulfilment than physicians. Individuals with high exposure to COVID-19 patients reported higher exhaustion and depersonalization. Resilience and sleep quality were significantly correlated with psychological and work-related burden, suggesting their potential role as protective resources. In general, the comparison of the present data to the survey conducted in 2020 suggests an overall increase of psychological burden in health care workers. Despite these surely alarming findings, it should be noted that being vaccinated might come along with reduced psychological strain.","Reicherts, Zerbini, Halms, Strasser, Papazova, Hasan, Kunz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2022.100054","20220615","COVID-19; Psychological burden; Resilience; Sleep; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32884,""
"Impact of COVID-19-related Stress on Preschool Children's Internalizing and Externalizing Problem Behaviors: The Indirect Effect of Mother's Depression and Parenting Behavior","The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting families and children worldwide. Experiencing the pandemic leads to stress in families resulting from fear of infection and social isolation derived from social distancing. For families raising preschoolers, the prolonged closure of childcare centers puts additional childcare burden on family members, especially mothers. Due to the limited research exploring the impact of COVID-19 on preschool children's problem behaviors, this study examines the association between stress due to COVID-19 and preschool children's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors related to mother's depression and parenting behavior. The study sample included data collected from 316 South Korean mothers raising preschool-aged children aged 3 to 5. The study findings suggest that mother's COVID-19 stress was indirectly associated with preschool children's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors resulting from the mother's depression and parenting behaviors, although the direct effect of COVID-19 stress on preschool children's outcomes was not statistically significant. Increase in mother's COVID-19 stress was associated with increase in depression, and sequentially decreased positive parenting behaviors, which in turn resulted in preschool children's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. The study findings highlight the need to focus on enhancing mental health of mothers and preschool children's adjustment by implementing supportive interventions to reduce the adverse impacts of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.","Joo, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12187-022-09946-0","20220615","COVID-19 mother; Depression; Externalizing problem behavior; Internalizing problem behavior; Parenting behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32885,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Doctors and Medical Students of Punjab, Pakistan: A Logistic Regression Analysis","This study was carried out to find the awareness level, prevalence of anxiety and depression, and their associated factors among doctors and medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Punjab province, Pakistan. An online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted; data were collected regarding the demographic profile, awareness of COVID-19, anxiety symptoms using a self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and depression symptoms using a self-rating depression scale (SDS). A total of 504 responses were obtained. The Chi-square test was used to compare groups and the logistic regression model for the association of factors with anxiety and depression. A total of 504 medical students and doctors responded to the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 25.66 Ã‚Â± 6.71 years. The awareness rate of COVID-19 was 97.6%. The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression was 3.4% and 15.1%, respectively. According to the logistic regression model, those with low awareness levels (Ã¢â€°Â¤6 points) and spending more time on the news (&gt;3 hours) had higher levels of anxiety, while higher levels of depression symptoms were reported in females, young people, and medical students. Doctors and medical students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19 and a low level of anxiety and depression. However, female gender and younger age group were the most vulnerable groups significantly associated with depression.","Junaid Tahir, Tariq, Anas Tahseen Asar, Irfan Malik, Kamal Akhtar, Malik, Akhtar, Abbasher Hussien Mohamed Ahmed, Talha Awan, Ullah, Asghar","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S369452","20220615","COVID-19; anxiety; awareness; depression; doctors; infection; medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32886,""
"Mental health of Covid-19 risk groups during the first Covid-19 lockdown in Germany: a cross-sectional study","The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic not only threatens physical health, but also affects the mental health of people. Yet, health consequences of the pandemic do not affect all members of society equally. We therefore assessed the mental health burden of individuals who are at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 compared to individuals who are at low risk of severe illness during the first lockdown (March, 2020) in Germany. Furthermore, we investigated variables mediating the effect of being an individual at increased risk of serve illness on depression. Adult German residents (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.369) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about risk factors for of severe illness from Covid-19 and various aspects of mental health during the first lockdown in Germany. For data collection, standardized and validated self-report measures were used and for data analysis Mann-Whitney U-tests as well as regression and mediation analyses were performed. The results clearly show that the mental health burden is higher among individuals at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 compared to individuals at low risk of severe illness from Covid-19. Moreover, our findings indicate that the association between Covid-19 risk status and depressive symptoms is mediated by concerns about mental health, anxiety and loneliness in a causal effect chain. Individuals at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 have an increased need for psychosocial support during times of lockdown. Future public health policies should pay special attention to these individuals and support them by targeted offers. More research, however, is needed on possible long-term consequences of social distancing on mental health.","Deimel, KÃƒÂ¶hler, Dyba, Graf, Firk","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13593-z","20220614","Covid-19; Covid-19 risk group; Germany; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32887,""
"Providers' perspectives on implementing resilience coaching for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic severely exacerbated workplace stress for healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide. The pandemic also magnified the need for mechanisms to support the psychological wellbeing of HCWs. This study is a qualitative inquiry into the implementation of a HCW support program called Resilience Coaching at a general hospital. Resilience Coaching was delivered by an interdisciplinary team, including: psychiatrists, mental health nurses allied health and a senior bioethicist. The study focuses specifically on the experiences of those who provided the intervention. Resilience Coaching was implemented at, an academic hospital in Toronto, Canada in April 2020 and is ongoing. As part of a larger qualitative evaluation, 13 Resilience Coaches were interviewed about their experiences providing psychosocial support to colleagues. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes by the research team. Interviews were conducted between February and June 2021. Coaches were motivated by opportunities to support colleagues and contribute to the overall health system response to COVID-19. Challenges included finding time within busy work schedules, balancing role tensions and working while experiencing burnout. Hospital-based mental health professionals are well-positioned to support colleagues' wellness during acute crises and can find this work meaningful, but note important challenges to the role. Paired-coaches and peer support among the coaching group may mitigate some of these challenges. Perspectives from those providing support to HCWs are an important consideration in developing support programs that leverage internal teams.","Rosen, Preisman, Read, Chaukos, Greenberg, Jeffs, Maunder, Wiesenfeld","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08131-x","20220614","Burnout; Coaching; Healthcare; Resilience; Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32888,""
"COVID-19 quarantine in adolescents with autoimmune rheumatic diseases: mental health issues and life conditions","To assess mental health and life conditions in adolescents with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) and healthy controls quarantined during COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study included 155 ARD adolescents and 105 healthy controls. Online survey included self-reported strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), and a semi-structured questionnaire with demographic data, daily home and school routine, physical activities, and COVID-19 information during the pandemic. Among patients, 56% had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 29% juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE), and 15% juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). No differences were found regarding sex, ethnicity, and current age between ARD patients and controls (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Abnormal emotional SDQ (38% vs. 35%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.653) were similar in both groups. Logistic regression analyses in ARD patients demonstrated that female (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.4; 95%CI 1.0-6.0; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.044) was associated with severe emotional SDQ dysfunction, whereas sleep problems were considered as a risk factor for both worse total SDQ (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.6; 95%CI 1.2-5.5; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.009) and emotional SDQ scores (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.6; 95%CI 2.2-9.7; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Comparisons between ARD patients with and without current prednisone use showed higher median scores of peer problems in the first group [3 (0-10) vs. 2 (0-7), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.049], whereas similar median and frequencies between JIA, JSLE, and JDM (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Approximately one third of JIA, JSLE, and JDM patients presented abnormal total and emotional scores of SDQ during COVID-19 quarantine. Sleep problems were the main factor associated with emotional difficulties in these ARD adolescents. The knowledge of mental health issues rates in adolescents with ARD supports the development of prevention strategies, like sleep hygiene counseling, as well as the references of the affected patients to specialized mental health services, as necessary. Key Points Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ One third of ARD patients presented mental health issues during COVID-19 quarantine Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Sleep problems were associated with emotional difficulties. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ It is necessary to warn pediatric rheumatologists about the importance of sleep hygiene counseling.","Ihara, Lindoso, Setoue, Tanigava, Helito, Simon, Viana, Strabelli, Pedroso, Sieczkowska, Pereira, Aikawa, Kozu, Elias, Buscatti, Gualano, Queiroz, Casella, Polanczyk, Silva, Campos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-022-06234-8","20220614","Autoimmune rheumatic diseases; COVID-19; Life conditions; Mental health issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32889,""
"Factors Associated With a Positive View of Respiratory Care Leadership","Burnout within health care is prevalent, and its effects are detrimental to patient outcomes, organizations, and individuals. Effects stemming from burnout include anxiety, depression, excessive alcohol and drug use, cardiovascular problems, time off work, and worse patient outcomes. Published data have suggested up to 50% of health care workers experience burnout and 79% of respiratory therapists (RTs) experience burnout. Leadership has been cited as a key driver of burnout among RTs. We aimed to identify factors associated with a positive or negative leadership perception. A post hoc analysis of an institutional review board-approved survey to evaluate RT burnout, administered via REDCap by convenience sample to 26 health care centers (3,124 potential respondents) from January 17-March 15, 2021, was performed to identify factors associated with a positive view of leadership. Survey questions included validated tools to measure leadership, burnout, staffing, COVID-19 exposure, and demographics. Data analysis was descriptive, and logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors associated with leadership perception. Of 1,080 respondents, 710 (66%) had a positive view of leadership. Univariate analysis revealed those with a positive view of leadership were more likely to be working with adequate staffing, were rarely unable to complete all work, were less likely to be burned out, disagreed that people in this work environment were burned out, were less likely to miss work for any reason, more likely to be in a leadership position, worked fewer hours in intensive care, worked in a center affiliated with a medical school, worked day shift, were less likely to care for adult patients, and were more likely to be male. Logistic regression revealed providing care to patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 5.8-10.5, <i>P</i> &lt; .001-.006) was the only factor associated with a positive view of leadership, whereas working without adequate staffing (OR 0.27-0.28, <i>P</i> = .002-.006), staff RTs (OR 0.33, <i>P</i> &lt; .001), work environment (OR 0.42, <i>P</i> = .003), missing work for any reason (OR 0.69, <i>P</i> = .003), and burnout score (OR 0.98, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) were associated with a negative view of leadership. Most RTs had a positive view of their leadership. A negative leadership score was associated with higher burnout and missing work. This relationship requires further investigation to evaluate if changes in leadership practices can improve employee well-being and reduce burnout.","Burr, Hinkson, Smith, Roberts, Strickland, Hoerr, Rehder, Miller","https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.10081","20220614","COVID-19; burnout; leadership; leadership perception; respiratory care practitioner; respiratory therapist; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32890,""
"Influence on study outcomes of an inpatient study by the behavior of the study staff (PINgPOng): study protocol for a randomized clinical trial","The placebo effect as the symptom improvement following inert treatments is a fixed component of RCTs to differentiate between specific effects of the tested pharmacological substance from other unspecific effects. The PINgPOng study was set up to analyze the influence of a study team trained to either minimize the placebo response and optimize drug-placebo differences or to maximize the placebo response to increase drug efficacy by unspecific factors on the study results of a RCT in a classical early clinical trial setting. PINgPOng is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in a 3-group, 2-sequence, 2-period cross-over design. The study is conducted according to the principles of ICH-GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki on the Phase I-Unit of the University Hospital Bonn. The primary endpoint is the pain intensity in the cold pressor test before and after the administration of 15 mg oxycodone or placebo. The pain intensity is compared between three study conditions: 32 healthy volunteers in each study arm will be treated either by an untrained study team (arm A), by a study team trained to maximize (arm B), or to minimize placebo responses (arm C). Neuroendocrine factors (alpha-amylase activity, salivary cortisol), characteristic traits (anxiety, depression, stress), and somatic reactions are analyzed as covariates of the pain perception. The PINgPOng study will allow to answer the question whether and to what extent the behavior of a trained study team (neutral vs. maximize vs. minimize placebo responses) will differentially affect placebo responses in a setting of a highly standardized early clinical trial. The results will help to control the placebo effects by education of the clinical study team and to avoid unnecessary high placebo effects in clinical development.

"Single-session interventions embedded within Tumblr: A test of acceptability and utility","Background: Existing mental health treatments are insufficient for addressing mental health needs at scale, particularly for teenagers; many teens now seek mental health information and support online. Single-session interventions (SSIs) may be particularly well-suited for dissemination as embedded, online support options that are easily-accessible within popular social platforms. Objective: Evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of three, 5 to 8-minute SSIs (ABC Project, Project SAVE, and REFRAME)â€”embedded as Koko â€œminicoursesâ€ on Tumblrâ€”to improve three key mental health outcomes: hopelessness, self-hate, and desire to stop self-harm behavior. Methods: Quantitative data (i.e., star ratings, SSI completion rates) evaluated acceptability and short-term utility of all three SSIs. Paired t-tests assessed changes in hopelessness, self-hate, and desire to stop future self-harm, from pre- to post-SSI. Where demographic information was available, analyses were restricted to teenagers (13-19 years). Examples of positive and negative qualitative user feedback (i.e., written text responses) were provided for each program. Results: Between March 2021 and February 2022, the SSIs were completed 6,179 times. All three SSIs generated high star ratings (>4 out of 5 stars), with high completion rates (~25-57%) relative to real-world completion rates among other digital self-help interventions. Paired t-tests detected significant pre-post reductions in hopelessness for those who completed ABC Project (P < .0001, dz = -.81, 95% CI [-.85, -.77]) and REFRAME (P < .0001, dz = -.88, 95% CI [-.96, -.80]). Self-hate significantly decreased (P < .0001, dz = -.67, 95% CI [-.74, -.60]), and desire to stop self-harm significantly increased (P < .0001, dz = .40, 95% CI [.33, .47]), from pre- to post-completion of Project SAVE. Results remained consistent across sensitivity analyses and after correcting for multiple tests. Examples of positive and negative qualitative user feedback point toward future directions for SSI research. Conclusions: Very brief SSIs, when embedded within popular social platforms, are one promising and acceptable method for providing free, scalable, and potentially helpful mental health support online. Considering unique barriers to mental health treatment access that many teenagers face, this approach may be especially useful for teens without access to other mental health supports.","Mallory L.

"Implications of rising female reproductive-age mortality for fertility in the United States, 2010â€“2019","Recent increases in female reproductive-age mortality in the United States (U.S.) imply that fewer women lived to bear children than would be expected had mortality stayed constant. We apply a cohort component projection model with alternative specifications to counterfactually estimate the impact of changes in female reproductive-age mortality on fertility in the period 2010â€“2019. We estimate the number of live births if (1) female mortality in the observation period had changed under three alternative scenarios, and, separately, if (2) age-specific fertility rates had remained constant after 2010. We find that fertility in the U.S. would have been higher had female all-cause mortality between ages 12 and 55 not increased after 2010, and if the U.S. had experienced European patterns of female reproductive-age mortality. For each cause of death, the number of children that would have additionally been born depends on the magnitude and timing of changes in female reproductive-age mortality and the average age at death. Thus, increases in mortality from accidental drug poisonings and suicide have had the strongest implications for U.S. fertility. However, we conclude that changes in womenâ€™s reproductive patterns have had much larger consequences for fertility than simultaneous changes in female reproductive-age mortality.","Antonino Polizzi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00D8-B20-196","20220616","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; counterfactual; mortality; united states; cause of death; fertility","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-16","",32899,""
