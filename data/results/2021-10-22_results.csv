"Suicide, self-harm and suicidal ideation during COVID-19: A systematic review","We aimed to do a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies describing suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide and associated risk factors during COVID-19 pandemic. We searched following electronic databases using relevant search terms: Medline, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL and systematically reviewed the evidence following PRISMA guidelines. The meta-analysis of prevalence of suicidal ideation was done using random effect model. The search returned 972 records, we examined 106 in full text and included 38 studies describing 120,076 participants. Nineteen studies described suicide or attempted self-harm, mostly in case reports. Out of 19 studies describing suicidal ideations, 12 provided appropriate data for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation in these studies was 12.1% (CI 9.3-15.2). Main risk factors for suicidal ideations were: low social support, high physical and mental exhaustion and poorer self-reported physical health in frontline medical workers, sleep disturbances, quarantine and exhaustion, loneliness, and mental health difficulties. We provide first meta-analytic estimate of suicidal ideation based on large sample from different countries and populations. The rate of suicidal ideations during COVID pandemic is higher than that reported in studies on general population prior to pandemic and may result in higher suicide rates in future.","Farooq, Tunmore, Ali, Ayub","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114228","20211020","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; isolation; lockdown; pandemic; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18951,""
"Alcohol use in self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Brazil","To assess alcohol use and perceived change in alcohol consumption (before and during the pandemic) in Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic, its correlates, and association with depressive, anxiety and co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms (D&amp;A). This is a cross-sectional study comprising 992 individuals in self-isolation. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess whether participants were drinking during self-isolation and whether they changed their drinking behavior (drinking less, more, or no change) from before to during the pandemic. D&amp;A symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI). A total of 68.5% of participants reported alcohol consumption during the pandemic, and 22.7% of these reported increased alcohol use. Smoking was positively associated with alcohol consumption during the pandemic. Alcohol consumption was associated with anxiety (OR=1.40, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.85, p&lt;0.01) and D&amp;A (OR=1.38, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.87, p=0.033) symptoms. Drinking during self-isolation was prevalent and associated with risk factors for alcohol use disorders. The long-term effects of high drinking rates and increased consumption should be proactively monitored and assessed.","Moura, von Diemen, Bulzing, Meyer, Grabovac, LÃƒÂ³pez-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Sadarangani, Tully, Smith, Schuch","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0337","20211020","Alcohol; COVID-19; anxiety; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18952,""
"Student-senior isolation prevention partnership: a Canada-wide programme to mitigate social exclusion during the COVID-19 pandemic","Amidst the pandemic, Canada has taken critical steps to curb the transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A key intervention has been physical distancing. Although physical distancing may protect older adults and other at-risk groups from COVID-19, research suggests quarantine and isolation may worsen mental health. Among older adults, social exclusion and social safety nets are social determinants of health (SDOH) that may be uniquely affected by the COVID-19 physical distancing measures. Health promotion programmes designed to reduce social exclusion and enhance social safety nets are one way to mitigate the potential mental health implications of this pandemic. The Student-Senior Isolation Prevention Partnership (SSIPP) is a student-led, community health promotion initiative that has scaled into a nation-wide effort to improve social connection among older adults. This initiative began with in-person visits and transformed into a tele-intervention guided by health promotion principles due to COVID-19. SSIPP continued to target the SDOH of social exclusion and social safety nets by pairing student volunteers with older adults to engage in weekly phone- and video-based interactions. Informed by the community partnership model by Best et al., SSIPP is built on the three orientations of empowerment, behaviour and organization, which are achieved through cross-disciplinary collaboration. This article reviews the importance of the adaptability of health promotion programmes, such as SSIPP during a pandemic, placing an emphasis on the lessons learned and future steps. A common way to slow the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is for people to keep their distance from one another. This has led to isolation and loneliness, especially for older adults. The StudentÃ¢â‚¬â€œSenior Isolation Prevention Partnership (SSIPP) is a programme developed by students and physicians in Toronto, Canada. The programme pairs student volunteers with older adults for weekly social interactions. These interactions were in-person before COVID-19. Following the physical distancing recommendations as a result of COVID-19, the programme quickly adapted to use phone and video calls instead. Establishing and leveraging key partnerships, identifying a window of opportunity, assessing community-specific needs and creating national manuals and protocols were key factors in facilitating simultaneous expansion across Canada. This article addresses the importance of programmes like SSIPP in preventing negative health impacts associated with loneliness and isolation. The authors also discuss the adaptability of SSIPP, lessons learned for future pandemic efforts and next steps.","Naidu, Persaud, Sheikhan, Sem, O'Driscoll, Diamond, Pitch, Dhingra, Nowak, Kuluski","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab118","20211020","COVID-19; health equity; health promotion; social exclusion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18953,""
"The Brazilian LGBT+ Health Survey: methodology and descriptive results","The understanding of health care demands and possible access barriers may support policymaking and best practices targeting the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and related identities (LGBT+) population. The aims of the Brazilian LGBT+ Health Survey were to characterize the LGBT+ population during the COVID-19 pandemic and to specify the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in this population. This is a cross-sectional online study, with a convenience sample of 976 individuals identified as LGBT+, aged 18 years or older from Brazil. It allows investigations of sexuality, discrimination, internal homophobia, health-related behaviors, and health care access. The study adopts a conceptual framework (i.e., validated tools and measures) common to other epidemiological studies, allowing comparisons. We describe the study methodology, some descriptive results, and health-selected indicators compared with the Brazilian National Health Survey. Most of the respondents were from Southeast Region (80.2%), mean aged 31.3 (Ã‚Â± 11.5 years). Regarding COVID-19, 4.8% tested positive. Both weekly episodes of discrimination (36%) and depression prevalence (24.8%) were high among the LGBT+ population in Brazil, highlighting mental health and homophobia as major concerns in the LGBT+ context during the pandemic. Although a decade has passed since the institution of the Brazilian National Policy for Comprehensive LGBT Health, appropriate training of health professionals to offer adequate services is still needed. Knowledge of the specific health demands of this group might guide person-centered best practices, promote sexual minority high-acceptance settings, and contribute to higher equity during the pandemic.","Torres, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Pinho, Souza","https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311X00069521","20211020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18954,""
"Music and mood regulation during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","Music listening can be an effective strategy for regulating affect, leading to positive well-being. However, it is unclear how differences in disposition and personality can impact music's affective benefits in response to acute and major real-world stressful events. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study how music is used to cope with stress, loss, and unease across the world. During the first month of the spread of the COVID pandemic, we used an online survey to test if people from four different countries used music to manage their emotions during quarantine and if the functions of music depended on empathy, anxiety, depression, or country of residence. We found a positive relationship between the use of music listening for affect regulation and current well-being, particularly for participants from India. While people with stronger symptoms of depression and anxiety used music differently, the end result was still a positive change in affect. Our findings highlight the universality of music's affective potency and its ability to help people manage an unprecedented life stressor.","Hennessy, Sachs, Kaplan, Habibi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258027","20211020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18955,""
"The role of anxiety, stigma, religiosity, and economic condition in COVID-19 preventive efforts among lecturers","The COVID-19 pandemic influences the spirituality and mental health of individuals. It also has caused a global economic recession. COVID-19 is easily transmitted and causes death. Consequently, severe prevention and control measures of COVID 19 are required in this situation. This study aims to analyze the relationship between anxiety, stigma, religiosity, economic conditions, and the prevention of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was designed. The data collection was taken through online surveys. The population in this study is ninety-two lecturers from the College of Health Sciences and the State Islamic Institute who were chosen using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. Data analysis used logistic regression analysis. The results showed that there was a relationship between anxiety (p = 0.001), stigma (p = 0.008), religiosity (p = 0.005) and the efforts to prevent COVID-19, while economic conditions (p = 0.882) were not related to the preventive efforts. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that the most influential variable affecting COVID-19 preventions was the level of anxiety, with an Odds Ratio of 4.9. There was a relationship between anxiety, stigma, religiosity, and COVID-19 preventions, while there was no relationship between economic conditions and COVID-19 preventions. The most influencing variable was anxiety. Respondents must be able to manage anxiety levels related to COVID-19 with good coping strategies.","Herawati, Dani, Herlinawati, Bakhri, Banowati, Wahyuni, Abdurakhman","https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14085","20211020","anxiety; economy; prevention; religiosity; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18956,""
"Symptoms of distress among young Danes during the national lockdown in May 2020","Objectives of this study were to assess (1) prevalence of worries and symptoms of distress, and (2) perceived change in symptoms of distress by sociodemographic factors and preexisting vulnerabilities, among young Danes under theÃ‚Â first COVID-19 related lockdown. Data were derived from online surveys, collected 7th-18th of May 2020. The study population included 11,245 young people (15-20Ã‚Â years of age), of which 1807 had participated in The Danish National Youth Study 2019 (DNYS19). Descriptive statistics and linear regressions analyses, including robust standard errors, were performed. All analyses were based on cross-sectional data, except analyses of preexisting vulnerabilities among responders from DNYS19. Few young people were very worried to get infected with coronavirus. Females reported a higher frequency of symptoms of distress than males. Perceived change in symptoms of distress, did not vary systematically based on age, cohabitation, nor physical health conditions. Individuals working, perceived a lower increase in symptoms of distress, than those studying etc. Females with symptoms of anxiety pre-pandemic, mental health disorders, and in families with economic hardship had a marginal higher perceived increase in symptoms of distress, than females without these difficulties. The tendencies were similar but nonsignificant among males, and for symptoms of depression pre-pandemic. In conclusion, during the lockdown, young females reported a higher frequency of symptoms of distress than males, and individuals with symptoms of anxiety pre-pandemic, mental health disorders, and in families with economic hardship were more likely to perceive the lockdown to be associated with an increase in symptoms of distress, than individuals without these difficulties.","Hoffmann, Pisinger, Rosing, Tolstrup","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01888-2","20211020","COVID-19; Corona; Lockdown; Mental health; Pandemic; Young","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18957,""

"Provision of services to persons experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study on the perspectives of homelessness service providers","This study aimed to explore the perspectives of homelessness service providers on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on service provision, barriers encountered and learning for the future. Semi-structured online interviews were conducted with homelessness service providers (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15) identified through the network of homelessness services operating within the United Kingdom. Data were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using framework technique. Six key themes were identified including the impact of the pandemic on health and well-being of persons experiencing homelessness (PEH); the changing needs of service users during the pandemic; impact of emergency provision of housing support on services offered; service adaptations; sustainability of services and learnings from the pandemic. Participants described that being able to offer accommodation through government schemes provided protection to PEH through 'wrap-around support'. The pandemic was deemed to have precipitated change and developed resilience in some services. However, lack of resources, donations and sponsors during the pandemic constrained the services forcing many to close or offer reduced services. Reduced face-to-face contact with PEH and lack of ability to offer skills sessions led to the exacerbation of mental health concerns amongst clients. The pandemic was also identified to have encouraged positive relationship building between clients and service providers, better communications between service providers and effective housing of PEH. There is a need to address the barriers, sustain the positive learnings and enable organisations and PEH to adapt to the transition when transient and emergency support from the government and local councils ends.","Kaur, Jagpal, Paudyal","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13609","20211020","COVID-19; homeless persons; homelessness; homelessness services; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18960,""
"Changes in Sewage Sludge Chemical Signatures During a COVID-19 Community Lockdown, Part 1: Traffic, Drugs, Mental Health, and Disinfectants","The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated shutdowns disrupted many aspects of daily life and thus caused changes in the use and disposal of many types of chemicals. While records of sales, prescriptions, drug overdoses, and so forth provide data about specific chemical uses during this time, wastewater and sewage sludge analysis can provide a more comprehensive overview of chemical changes within a region. We analyzed primary sludge from a wastewater-treatment plant in Connecticut, USA, collected March 19 to June 30, 2020. This time period encompassed the first wave of the pandemic, the initial statewide stay at home order, and the first phase of reopening. We used liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry and targeted and suspect screening strategies to identify 78 chemicals of interest, which included pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, disinfectants, ultraviolet (UV) filters, and others. We analyzed trends over time for the identified chemicals using linear trend analyses and multivariate comparisons (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). We found trends related directly to the pandemic (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, a drug publicized for its potential to treat COVID-19, had elevated concentrations in the week following the implementation of the US Emergency Use Authorization), as well as evidence for seasonal changes in chemical use (e.g., increases for three UV-filter compounds). Though wastewater surveillance during the pandemic has largely focused on measuring severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 RNA concentrations, chemical analysis can also show trends that are important for revealing the public and environmental health effects of the pandemic.

"Psychiatric comorbidities among COVID-19 survivors in North India: A cross-sectional study","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged from China and rapidly spread to many other countries all over the world. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms among COVID-19 survivors after their discharge from the COVID-19 treatment center. This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based study performed among 119 COVID-19 survivors. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure anxiety and depression. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-Checklist (PCL) and Brief OC Scale were used to measure PTSD and OC symptoms. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics using the SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2015 version 23.0). The mean anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores were, 7.12 Ã‚Â± 0.68, 8.08 Ã‚Â± 0.22, and 19.78 Ã‚Â± 0.88, respectively.

Older COVID-19 survivors (Ã¢â€°Â¥50 years) were more likely to show symptoms of depression and anxiety (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) compared to younger ones. Furthermore, COVID-19 survivors who were Ã¢â€°Â¥50 years of age experienced a greater level of PTSD compared to younger ones; similar trends were seen in those experiencing OC symptoms. In the present study, <i>n</i> = 98 (82.4%) were obsessed with fears of contamination and an equal number had compulsive handwashing.

The questionnaire was designed in Google Forms and mailed to respond using Likert scale. The nonparametric data collected from the total 84 respondents were analyzed for validity and reliability of the questionnaire, mean values to know the readiness (mean = 3.4), and one-step multiple regression to know the predictors. The mean eLR (e-learning readiness) as evaluated from attitudinal readiness (Mean<sub>AR</sub> = 3.6), culture readiness (Mean<sub>CR</sub> = 2.3), material and technological readiness (Mean<sub>MTR</sub> = 3.7), and mental health readiness (Mean<sub>MHR</sub> = 2.4) is 3.03 (60.6% with <i>n</i> = 84). Multiple regression analysis revealed that all the variables except MHR can significantly predict e-learning readiness linearly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).

"Efficacy of a brief online mindfulness-based intervention on the psychological well-being of health care professionals and trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed method design","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health professionals were pushed to the front line of a global health crisis unprepared and resource constrained, which affected their mental well-being. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a brief online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on stress and burnout for health professionals training and working in South Africa during the COVID-19 crisis. The context of the study is the overburdened, under-resourced health care system in South Africa during a global pandemic. A mixed method framework was adopted for this study. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive analysis and the participants' qualitative experiences were interpreted using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Forty-seven participants took part in this study. The study found a statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) reduction in stress levels and emotional exhaustion as well as an increase in mindful awareness and feelings of personal accomplishment after the intervention. The participants' shared experiences were analysed in two parts. The pre-intervention analysis presented with central themes of loss of control and a sense of powerlessness because of COVID-19. The post-intervention analysis comprised themes of a sense of acquired control and empowerment through increased mindfulness. The study found that a brief online MBI can be associated with reduced levels of stress and burnout as well as an increased sense of control and empowerment, felt both personally and professionally, during a global crisis. The impact of an online MBI for health care professionals amidst a pandemic has not been previously documented.","Osman, Hamid, Singaram","https://doi.org/10.4102/hsag.v26i0.1682","20211020","COVID-19; burnout; health professionals; mental health; mindfulness; self-care; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18964,""

"Signaling pathways in the regulation of cytokine release syndrome in human diseases and intervention therapy","Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) embodies a mixture of clinical manifestations, including elevated circulating cytokine levels, acute systemic inflammatory symptoms and secondary organ dysfunction, which was first described in the context of acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and was later observed in pandemics of influenza, SARS-CoV and COVID-19, immunotherapy of tumor, after chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy, and in monogenic disorders and autoimmune diseases. Particularly, severe CRS is a very significant and life-threatening complication, which is clinically characterized by persistent high fever, hyperinflammation, and severe organ dysfunction. However, CRS is a double-edged sword, which may be both helpful in controlling tumors/viruses/infections and harmful to the host. Although a high incidence and high levels of cytokines are features of CRS, the detailed kinetics and specific mechanisms of CRS in human diseases and intervention therapy remain unclear. In the present review, we have summarized the most recent advances related to the clinical features and management of CRS as well as cutting-edge technologies to elucidate the mechanisms of CRS. Considering that CRS is the major adverse event in human diseases and intervention therapy, our review delineates the characteristics, kinetics, signaling pathways, and potential mechanisms of CRS, which shows its clinical relevance for achieving both favorable efficacy and low toxicity.","Li, Shao, Zeng, Qian, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00764-4","20211020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18966,""
"Changes in the reach of a smoking cessation program in Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Given the harms associated with tobacco use, continuing the provision of smoking cessation treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical. The aim of this study was to examine pandemic-related changes in enrolment, total treatment use and participant characteristics in a large, publicly funded smoking cessation program in Ontario, Canada. We conducted a secondary data analysis of patients who enrolled in the program between Jan. 1, 2018, and Dec. 7, 2020. We used descriptive statistics to examine changes in treatment use. To test for differences in sociodemographic and health variables, we used segmented mixed-effects regression with a break point on Mar. 17, 2020, when Ontario declared a state of emergency. We tested 25 variables, using Holm's correction for multiplicity. We analyzed 60 373 enrolments. In the month after the break point, enrolments fell 69% and total visits fell 42% relative to previous years. After Mar. 17, 2020, those who enrolled were less likely to report employment in the previous week (absolute expected difference -12.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -15.0% to -9.8%); were more likely to be occasional (1.3%, 95% CI 0.6% to 1.9%) or noncurrent smokers (1.7%, 95% CI 0.8% to 2.6%); were less likely to have set a target quit date (-4.8%, 95% CI -7.0% to -2.6%); and were more likely to have a physical health (6.6%, 95% CI 4.0% to 9.2%), mental health (4.6%, 95% CI 1.9% to 7.2%) or substance use diagnosis (3.5%, 95% CI 1.3% to 5.6%). Sharp decreases in new enrolments and subsequent visits to smoking cessation programs were seen when pandemic restrictions were implemented in Ontario, but the characteristics of the people who accessed the programs did not change markedly. Incorporating an equity perspective is essential when new models of care for smoking cessation are developed.","Minian, Veldhuizen, Tanzini, Duench, deRuiter, Barker, Zawertailo, Melamed, Selby","https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20210053","20211020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18967,""
"The trajectories of depressive symptoms among working adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal analysis of the InHamilton COVID-19 study","Longitudinal studies examining the impact of changes in COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors and experiences, and coping styles on the mental health trajectory of employed individuals during the lockdown are limited. The study examined the mental health trajectories of a sample of employed adults in Hamilton, Ontario during the initial lockdown and after the re-opening following the first wave in Canada. Further, this study also identified the pandemic-related stressors and coping strategies associated with changes in depressive symptoms in employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The InHamilton COVID-19 longitudinal study involved 579 employees aged 22-88Ã¢â‚¬â€°years from a large public university in an urban area of Hamilton, Ontario at baseline (April 2020). Participants were followed monthly with 6 waves of data collected between April and November 2020. A growth mixture modeling approach was used to identify distinct groups of adults who followed a similar pattern of depressive symptoms over time and to describe the longitudinal change in the outcome within and among the identified sub-groups. Our results showed two distinct trajectories of change with 66.2% of participants displaying low-consistent patterns of depressive symptoms, and 33.8% of participants displaying high-increasing depressive symptom patterns. COVID-19 pandemic-related experiences including health concerns, caregiving burden, and lack of access to resources were associated with worsening of the depressive symptom trajectories. Frequent use of dysfunctional coping strategies and less frequent use of emotion-focused coping strategies were associated with the high and increasing depressive symptom pattern. The negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are specific to subgroups within the population and stressors may persist and worsen over time. Providing access to evidence-informed approaches that foster adaptive coping, alleviate the depressive symptoms, and promote the mental health of working adults is critical.","Joshi, Gonzalez, Griffith, Duncan, MacMillan, Kimber, Vrkljan, MacKillop, Beauchamp, Kates, Raina","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11900-8","20211020","COVID-19; Caregiving; Coping strategies; Depressive symptoms; Employed adults; Growth mixture modeling; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18968,""
"Domestic violence, coercive control and mental health in a pandemic: disenthralling the ecology of the domestic","<b>ABSTRACT</b>Domestic and family violence is a social and public health issue typically positioned in policy frameworks as a consequence of gendered social and economic structures. In this paper, we deploy an approach that draws on HÃƒÂ¶rl's neo-ecological thinking to propose that the home, as a site of domestic violence, can be usefully framed as an ecology of the domestic, a posthumanist hybrid matrix of bodies, spaces and objects in which various practices enact the smooth running of the domestic together with practices of domestic and family violence, including coercive control. Our interest is in coercive control and in the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on practices which enact this aspect of domestic violence. Our exploration of the practices that enact coercive control draws on the work of Law and others. We examine how practices, which are not compatible, or that do not cohere, are able to coexist in a domestic ecology and what occurs when there is a disruption as occurred with the pandemic.","McCallum, Rose","https://doi.org/10.1080/14461242.2021.1987954","20211020","COVID-19; Coercive control; domestic and family violence; domestic ecology; mental health; posthumanist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18969,""
"COVID-19 Bereavement in Ten Latin American Countries: Measurement Invariance of the Pandemic Grief Scale and Its Relation to Suicidal Ideation","The present study aimed to evaluate the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) in ten Latin American countries.

In addition to the PGS, a single item of suicidal ideation was applied. The unidimensional model of the PGS had adequate fit in most countries and good reliability estimates. There was evidence of measurement invariance by country and gender. Also, a one-point increase in the PGS was associated with an almost twofold increase in the odds of suicidal ideation. Scores greater than or equal to 4 on the PGS are proposed as a cut off to identify individuals with suicidal ideation.

"The application of e-mental health in response to COVID-19: A scoping review and bibliometric analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation measures such as shelter-in-place orders, social isolation, restrictions on freedoms, unemployment, financial insecurity and disrupted routines, have led to declines in mental health worldwide and concomitant escalating demands for mental health services. Under the circumstances, e-mental health programs and services have rapidly become the ""new normal"". To assess key characteristics and evidence gaps in the e-mental health literature published in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic via a scoping review and bibliometric analysis. A search of four academic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) published from 31st December 2019 to 31st March 2021 using keywords for e-mental health and COVID-19. Article information was extracted relevant to the review objective including journal, type of article, keywords, focus and corresponding author. Information was synthesised by coding these attributes, then summarised through descriptive statistics and narrative techniques. Article influence was examined from Altmetric and CiteScore data, and a network analysis was conducted on article keywords. A total of 356 publications were included in the review. Articles on e-mental health quickly thrived early in the pandemic, with most articles being non-empirical, chiefly commentaries or opinions (n = 225, 63.2%). Empirical publications emerged later and became more frequent as the pandemic progressed. The United States contributed the most articles (n = 160, 44.9%), though a notable number came from middle-income countries (n = 59, 16.6). Articles were spread across 165 journals, and were of above-average-influence (almost half of the articles were in the top 25% of outputs scores by Altmetric and the average CiteScore across articles was 4.22). The network analysis of author-supplied keywords identified key topic areas, including specific: mental disorders; e-health modalities; issues and challenges; and populations of interest. These were further explored via full-text analysis. Applications of e-mental health during the pandemic overcame, or were influenced by system, service, technology, provider and patient factors. COVID-19 has accelerated applications of e-mental health. Further research is needed to support the implementation of e-mental health across system and service infrastructure alongside evidence of the relative effectiveness of e-mental health in comparison to traditional modes of care.","Ellis, Meulenbroeks, Churruca, Pomare, Hatem, Harrison, Zurynski, Braithwaite","https://doi.org/10.2196/32948","20211019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18972,""
"Sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with depression, anxiety, and general mental health in people with multiple sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) may be at increased risk for psychological distress during COVID-19. We study the self-reported mental health of U.S. PwMS during COVID-19, prior to vaccine rollout. Methods A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to PwMS through iConquerMS (12/18/2020-02/10/2021). Depressive and anxiety symptom burdens and general mental health status were measured via the Patient-Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and PROMIS Global Mental Health scales. Linear regression models assessed associations between mental health variables and age, sex, disability status, comorbidities, and social determinants of health. Results Of 610Ã‚Â U.S. PwMS (mean age 56 years, standard deviation 11, range 20-85; female, 81%; relapsing remitting disease, 62%; previous depression diagnosis, 40%), the prevalences of moderate-to-severe depressive and anxiety symptom burden were 27.4% and 14.7%, respectively; 55.1% endorsed fair/poor general mental health. PwMS who tested positive for COVID-19 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 47, 7.7%) reported higher depressive and anxiety symptom burdens (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Increased disability status score and social determinants of health were each associated with more depressive symptoms and worse general mental health. Younger age was associated with increased depressive and anxiety symptom burdens and worse general mental health. Female sex was associated with greater anxiety symptoms. Conclusion There are specific associations for worse mental health among PwMS during COVID-19 that reflect a combination of clinical, demographic, and social determinants of health.

"Characteristics of patients in platform C19, a COVID-19 research database combining primary care electronic health record and patient reported information","Data to better understand and manage the COVID-19 pandemic is urgently needed. However, there are gaps in information stored within even the best routinely-collected electronic health records (EHR) including test results, remote consultations for suspected COVID-19, shielding, physical activity, mental health, and undiagnosed or untested COVID-19 patients. Observational and Pragmatic Research Institute (OPRI) Singapore and Optimum Patient Care (OPC) UK established Platform C19, a research database combining EHR data and bespoke patient questionnaire. We describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, patient behavior, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using data within Platform C19. EHR data from Platform C19 were extracted from 14 practices across UK participating in the OPC COVID-19 Quality Improvement program on a continuous, monthly basis. Starting 7th August 2020, consenting patients aged 18-85 years were invited in waves to fill an online questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were summarized using all data available up to 22nd January 2021. From 129,978 invitees, 31,033 responded. Respondents were predominantly female (59.6%), white (93.5%), and current or ex-smokers (52.6%). Testing for COVID-19 was received by 23.8% of respondents, of which 7.9% received positive results. COVID-19 symptoms lasted Ã¢â€°Â¥4 weeks in 19.5% of COVID-19 positive respondents. Up to 39% respondents reported a negative impact on questions regarding their mental health. Most (67%-76%) respondents with asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), diabetes, heart, or kidney disease reported no change in the condition of their diseases.

"How COVID-19 stress related to schooling and online learning affects adolescent depression and Internet gaming disorder: Testing Conservation of Resources theory with sex difference","The COVID-19 pandemic poses a grim challenge to adolescents' daily life, including schooling and learning, which has great impacts on their mental and behavioral health. This study aimed to test the roles of stress related to schooling and online learning during COVID-19 (COVID-19 stress) in depression and Internet gaming disorder (IGD) among adolescents and the potential mediators of social support, academic stress, and maladaptive emotion regulation based on the framework of Conservation of Resources theory. Sex differences in these associations were further examined. A school-based survey was conducted among Chinese adolescents in 13 secondary schools in Hong Kong (n = 3,136) from September to November 2020 (48.1% males; mean age = 13.6 years old) using stratified random sampling. The prevalence of probable depression and IGD was 60% and 15%, respectively. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that the proposed model fit the data well (Ãâ€¡2/df = 7.77, CFI = 0.92, IFI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.05). COVID-19 stress was positively and indirectly associated with both depression and IGD through social support, academic stress, and maladaptive emotion regulation. Multi-group analyses identified that the associations between COVID-19 stress and academic stress, between academic stress and depression, and between social support and depression were stronger among females compared to males. Findings highlight the roles of academic stress, poor social support, maladaptive emotion regulation, and sex to understand how disruption and stress caused by COVID-19 increases adolescent depression and IGD. Psychosocial interventions based on these factors are highly warranted.","She, Wong, Lin, Leung, Zhang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2021.00069","20211019","COVID-19; Conservation of Resources theory; Internet gaming disorder; mental distress; online learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18975,""
"A Mobile App to Identify Lifestyle Indicators Related to Undergraduate Mental Health (Smart Healthy Campus): Observational App-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment","Undergraduate studies are challenging, and mental health issues can frequently occur in undergraduate students, straining campus resources that are already in demand for somatic problems. Cost-effective measures with ubiquitous devices, such as smartphones, offer the potential to deliver targeted interventions to monitor and affect lifestyle, which may result in improvements to student mental health. However, the avenues by which this can be done are not particularly well understood, especially in the Canadian context. The aim of this study is to deploy an initial version of the Smart Healthy Campus app at Western University, Canada, and to analyze corresponding data for associations between psychosocial factors (measured by a questionnaire) and behaviors associated with lifestyle (measured by smartphone sensors). This preliminary study was conducted as an observational app-based ecological momentary assessment. Undergraduate students were recruited over email, and sampling using a custom 7-item questionnaire occurred on a weekly basis. First, the 7-item Smart Healthy Campus questionnaire, derived from fully validated questionnaires-such as the Brief Resilience Scale; General Anxiety Disorder-7; and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21-was shown to significantly correlate with the mental health domains of these validated questionnaires, illustrating that it is a viable tool for a momentary assessment of an overview of undergraduate mental health. Second, data collected through the app were analyzed. There were 312 weekly responses and 813 sensor samples from 139 participants from March 2019 to March 2020; data collection concluded when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Demographic information was not collected in this preliminary study because of technical limitations. Approximately 69.8% (97/139) of participants only completed one survey, possibly because of the absence of any incentive. Given the limited amount of data, analysis was not conducted with respect to time, so all data were analyzed as a single collection. On the basis of mean rank, students showing more positive mental health through higher questionnaire scores tended to spend more time completing questionnaires, showed more signs of physical activity based on pedometers, and had their devices running less and plugged in charging less when sampled. In addition, based on mean rank, students on campus tended to report more positive mental health through higher questionnaire scores compared with those who were sampled off campus. Some data from students found in or near residences were also briefly examined. Given these limited data, participants tended to report a more positive overview of mental health when on campus and when showing signs of higher levels of physical activity. These early findings suggest that device sensors related to physical activity and location are useful for monitoring undergraduate students and designing interventions. However, much more sensor data are needed going forward, especially given the sweeping changes in undergraduate studies due to COVID-19.","Brogly, Shoemaker, Lizotte, Kueper, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.2196/29160","20211020","ecological momentary assessment; lifestyle; mHealth; mental health; mobile application; mobile phone; postsecondary institutions; smartphones; undergraduates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18976,""
"Learning About the Current State of Digital Mental Health Interventions for Canadian Youth to Inform Future Decision-Making: Mixed Methods Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for youth mental health services in Canada as disruptions to clinical care continue to persist due to the risk of transmission and exposure to the virus. Digital mental health interventions, including web-based resources and mobile apps, have provided opportunities to support youth mental health remotely across Canada. There is a need to better understand how these digital interventions are being selected, recommended, and used in various regions across Canada. A national jurisdictional scan was completed to (1) determine what web-based programs, apps, and websites are promoted and licensed in Canada for youth mental health; (2) identify criteria and decision-making processes that Canadian jurisdictions use to select web-based programs, apps, and websites for youth mental health; and (3) identify upcoming trends, innovations, and digital mental health possibilities that are emerging in the youth sector. The aims of the jurisdictional scan were addressed through a review of related academic and grey literature; stakeholder interviews, including individuals involved in various areas of the youth mental health sector; and a social media review of pertinent Twitter content. A total of 66 web-based resources and apps were identified for use by youth in Canada. 16 stakeholder interviews were completed and included discussions with researchers, clinicians, youth organizations, and others involved in digital interventions for youth mental health. These discussions identified a limited use of frameworks used to guide decision-making processes when selecting digital interventions. Many clinicians agreed on a similar set of eligibility requirements for youth mental health apps and digital resources, such as the evidence base and cultural relevance of the intervention. Stakeholders also identified upcoming trends and innovations in the youth digital mental health space, including artificial intelligence, digital phenotyping, and personalized therapy. Over 4 weeks, 2184 tweets were reviewed to identify and compare global and national trends and innovations involving digital mental health and youth. Key trends included the promotion of regional chat services as well as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health and access to care. As organizations begin to plan for the delivery of mental health care following the pandemic, there are concerns about the sustainability of these digital mental health interventions as well as a need for services to be more informed by the experiences and preferences of youth.","Kemp, Chorney, Kassam, MacDonald, MacDonald, Wozney, Strudwick","https://doi.org/10.2196/30491","20211020","COVID-19; digital mental health; digital mental health interventions; e-mental health; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18977,""
"Storm Clouds and Silver Linings: Day-to-Day Life in COVID-19 Lockdown and Emotional Health in Adolescent Girls","We examined risk and protective factors for emotional health problems in adolescent girls during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated pre- to early-pandemic changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression, documented daily activities and perceived positive and negative impacts of the pandemic, and linked perceived positive and negative impacts of the pandemic to real-time changes in emotional health. The study was a 10-day daily diary study with 93 U.S. adolescent girls (aged 12-17; 68% White non-Hispanic) at temperamental risk for anxiety and depression, conducted in April/May 2020 when all participants were under state-issued stay-at-home orders. Girls provided daily reports of positive and negative affect, depressive and anxious symptoms, activities, and positive and negative impacts resulting from the pandemic. Girls reported engaging in many activities that may contribute to well-being. Mixed effects analyses revealed positive impacts associated with improved same-day emotional health such as more time for family and relaxation and reduced pressure from school/activities. Negative impacts associated with poorer same-day emotional health included problems with online schooling, lack of space/privacy, lack of a regular schedule, and family conflict. Findings highlight the importance of providing in-person or quality online schooling, resources and space for learning, promoting daily routines, and spending time with teens while reducing family conflict. The pandemic also appears to have offered many girls a respite from the chronic stress of modern teen life, with time to relax and engage in creative and healthy pursuits showing benefits for daily emotional health, which should be considered following the return to normal life.","Silk, Scott, Hutchinson, Lu, Sequeira, McKone, Do, Ladouceur","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab107","20211019","COVID-19; adolescents; anxiety; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18978,""

Results suggest that almost 9 out of 10 respondents experienced at least one potentially morally injurious event, 45.6% were at significant risk of impairment related to moral injury. Working with limited staff and resources, and the implications of it, was the most common potentially morally injurious situation reported by the respondents. Results suggest that MISS-HP Mistrust has significant negative correlations with LT traits. A hierarchical regression model determined that Moral Injury, but not LT traits, significantly affected depression symptoms. On the other hand, anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by Moral Injury, as did LTS-Humanism. The results were discussed according to their implications for public health policy in Latin America.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez, AgÃƒÂ¼ero-Flores, Landa-Blanco, Agurcia, Santos-Midence","https://doi.org/10.1177/15404153211042371","20211019","anxiety; coronavirus-2019; depression; health-care workers; light triad; moral injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18980,""
"Anxiety and depression in the first 24Ã‚Â h in COVID-19 patients who underwent non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit","The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of anxiety and depression in the first 24Ã‚Â h of people who were taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 and had to use unfamiliar devices in an unfamiliar environment. Sixty-two patients over 18Ã‚Â years of age, conscious and cooperative, who were admitted to the ICU with the diagnosis of COVID, were PCR (+), and needed non-invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. Age, gender, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, and Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) A (anxiety), and HAD D (depression) scores of the patients were recorded, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression and independent factors affecting them were investigated. The mean age of the patients was 57.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.6Ã‚Â years, and the mean APACHE II was 29.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.4. The average HAD A score was 10.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.5 in all patients, while the HAD D score was 10.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.3. The prevalence of anxiety was 37.1% (23 patients), and the prevalence of depression was 43.6% (27 patients). Age and APACHE II and anxiety/depression were negatively correlated, and when age and APACHE II scores increased, anxiety and depression decreased (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). In COVID-19 patients who underwent non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU, the rate of anxiety in the first 24Ã‚Â h of admission was 37.1% while for depression the rate was 43.6%. In addition, advanced age and high APACHE II scores were found to be associated with low anxiety and depression.

"COVID-19 risk of infection and vaccination during Ramadan fasting: knowledge and attitudes of Bangladeshi general population","There is some debate whether COVID-19 infection and vaccination will hamper Ramadan among the Muslim population worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the total proportion of the Bangladeshi population who has adequate knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 risk of infections and vaccination during Ramadan fasting. A cross-sectional study had conducted among 502 adult participants of Bangladesh. We have used a structured questionnaire which had implemented through a face-to-face interview by trained data collectors. Data were analyzed using statistical package software SPSS version 25.0. Of the 502 participants, 50.2% were male, and most (49.6%) lived in urban areas. About 72.5% and 76.30% reported having adequate knowledge and a positive attitude, respectively, regarding COVID-19 risk of infection and vaccination during Ramadan fasting. Among all variables, no formal education and up to class 8 education had significantly associated with inadequate knowledge (OR = 5.14, 95% CI = 1.63-16.19, and OR = 6.42, 95% CI = 2.55-16.19). Educational status was also associated with attitude (OR = 3.68, 95%CI = 1.17-11.55). Current smokers reported a negative attitude in comparison to non-smokers (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.36-4.50). In conclusion, our study found overall moderate knowledge and attitude among the Bangladeshi population towards COVID-19 infection and vaccination. Government should continue its efforts to increase the knowledge and attitude level to a higher level, and anti-smoking campaigns should strengthen to make people stop smoking to reduce the COVID-19 severity.","Mozid, Amin, Jhumur, Monju, Ahmed, Sharmin, Sarker, Hawlader","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08174","20211019","Attitude; COVID-19 infection; Knowledge; Ramadan; Vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18982,""
"Health-related quality of life and its correlates among individuals with stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic","Strict safety procedures including lockdowns were adopted during the Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide which might have influenced mental and physical health in affected communities. This study aimed to investigate the level of Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its correlates among individuals with stroke in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional study with a self-administered questionnaire, which included demographics, 12-item Short Form (SF-12) health survey, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), and The Stroke Impact Scale 16 (SIS-16). Descriptive analyses were used to summarize study data. Factors significantly correlated with HRQoL were determined using Pearson correlation. A total of 97 individuals successfully completed the study with a mean age of 57.9 years (Ã‚Â±57.9). The level of HRQoL (measured by SF-12) was significantly and negatively associated with mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress) and the stroke recovery subscale of the SIS-16. Furthermore, participants' HRQoL level was significantly and positively associated with participants' age, stroke chronicity, receiving rehabilitation, and amount of help asked from caregivers. Jordanians with stroke demonstrated a relatively low level of HRQoL and high levels of mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare administrators should carefully consider individuals with stroke HRQoL and its correlates while planning for future crises.","Almhdawi, Jaber, Alghwiri, Arabiat, Alazrai, Tariah, Obeidat, Alrabbaie","https://doi.org/10.1080/09602011.2021.1984256","20211019","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health-related quality of life; Stress; Stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18983,""
"Resilience of adolescents, though weakened during pandemic-related lockdown, serves as a protection against depression and sleep problems","Adolescents facing adversities are susceptible to depression and sleep problems. Resilience is an important protective mechanism for coping with adversity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents faced hardships including being pulled from their schools and being unable to socialize with friends during mandated lockdowns. We had three aims in this study. First, we sought to test whether Chinese adolescents' resilience was strengthened, maintained, or weakened during the COVID-19 lockdown. Second, we sought to test whether adolescents' resilience predicted depressive symptoms and in turn, sleep problems. Third, we sought to examine the role social support may play. In a partially-longitudinal survey study, we demonstrated via a within-subject <i>t</i>-test and its Bayesian equivalent that Chinese adolescents' resilience weakened during the lockdown compared with before the pandemic. However, resilience remained an important predictor: A mediation model demonstrated that higher resilience was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, which in turn predicted fewer sleep problems. Moreover, we found that social support moderated this mediation: Strong social support reduced the negative effects of low resilience levels. These results help shed light on the fragility of resilience, its importance for adolescents' mental health when facing adversity, and how we might support adolescents experiencing social distancing mandates or who are otherwise isolated from their peers.","Jiang, Yu, Lin, Macnamara","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1990367","20211019","adolescents; depression; lockdown; resilience; sleep problems; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18984,""
"Embedding Population Health in Physical Therapist Professional Education","The future of health care professional education is moving from a focus on the individual to embrace the health of the larger society. The COVID pandemic has further highlighted the connection between social determinants and the health of populations. There are frameworks and competencies to support the delivery of population health content in the entry-level DPT curriculum. Three options for integrating population health content into the DPT curriculum are presented: (1) threading the content throughout the curriculum, (2) concentrating the content in 1 or 2 identified courses, and (3) offering elective courses. Each of these strategies has benefits and challenges but threading the content throughout the curriculum provides the best opportunity to reinforce population health competencies across populations and practice settings. Experiential learning using authentic scenarios provides an ideal opportunity for students to understand population health concepts in a real-world context. Activities that incorporate interaction with other health professions broadens students' perspectives of the role of different professions for achieving population health goals. Examples of learning activities are included in three competency areas, Foundations of Population Health, Prevention and Health Promotion, and Health Policy. Current societal issues provide an opportunity to enhance population health education from a meaningful perspective for students. The topic of health equity presents an opportunity to tie social and political factors of population health to social justice and health outcomes. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic puts issues of mental health, health disparities, and health systems front and center in our understanding of population health. Healthcare practitioners are looking at health through the lens of health equity and acknowledging the impact of social and political determinants on health to address health disparities, decrease healthcare expenditures, and respond to changes necessitated by pandemics such as COVID-19. As healthcare systems and practices are rethought and reconstructed, the intentional integration of population health principles woven into the fabric of professional education is a critical component of preparing future providers. This paper describes how population health concepts can be meaningfully embedded into Doctor of Physical Therapy curriculum along with providing realistic examples and activities.","Dunleavy, Mejia-Downs, Guerrero, Wentzell, Rucker-Bussie, Davenport, Magnusson","https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzab238","20211018","Curriculum; Health Policy; Health Promotion; Physical Therapist Education; Population Health; Primary Prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18985,""
"Conducting Clinical Research Remotely for Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Depression during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Transitioning from In-Person to Remote Implementation","Telehealth provided many researchers, especially those conducting psychosocial research, with the tools necessary to transition in-person clinical trials to remote implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing body of research supports the effectiveness of telemental health for a variety of psychiatric conditions, but few studies have examined telemental health for individuals with comorbid medical diagnoses. Furthermore, little is known about the remote implementation of clinical trials examining telemental health interventions. This paper outlines the procedural modifications used to facilitate conversion of an in-person randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for individuals with depression and traumatic brain injury (TBI), CBT-TBI, to a telemental health study that is administered remotely. Given the nature of remote implementation and specific challenges experienced by individuals with TBI, considerations related to treatment delivery, remote consent, data management, neuropsychological assessment, safety monitoring, and delivery of supportive material are discussed. Feasibility, acceptability, and safety are evaluated by examining attendance and participant responses on self-report measures of treatment satisfaction and suicidal behavior. High rates of treatment attendance, assessment completion, study retention, and satisfaction with the intervention and modality are reported by participants who completed at least one telemental health CBT-TBI session. Study modifications are necessary when conducting a study remotely, and special attention should be paid to comorbidities and population-specific challenges (e.g., cognitive impairment). Preliminary data supports the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of remotely conducting a randomized controlled trial of CBT for depression after TBI.","Fisher, Tuchman, Curreri, Markgraf, Nyer, Cassano, Iverson, Fava, Zafonte, Pedrelli","https://doi.org/10.2196/28734","20211018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18986,""

"The effect of COVID-19 on schoolteachers' emotional reactions and mental health: longitudinal results from the CLASS study","We investigated schoolteachers' emotional reactions to COVID-19 and mental health during three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further analyzed if teachers, who belonged to a COVID-19 risk group, had more emotional reactions and poorer mental health than ""non-risk"" groups. We collected questionnaire data in May, June, and November-December 2020 and used data from 2665 teachers at public schools (871 individuals participated in all three surveys). Participants reported their fear of infection, fear of transmission of infection to their home or pupils, perceived burnout and stress, and worries about their ability to manage the working conditions. We included information about COVID-19 risk group status, gender, age, organization of teaching (physical presence or remote teaching), and the pupils' grade. We estimated prevalence ratios and took repeated measures into account. Emotional reactions and poor mental health increased significantly with 27-84% from May to November-December 2020. Teachers, who were particularly vulnerable to the adverse consequences of COVID-19, had the highest prevalence of fear of infection and poor mental health. Teachers play a crucial role in a society's response to a pandemic. Yet, the dual role of teaching and virus control along with concerns regarding the health consequences of an infection may contribute to the observed increase in emotional reactions to COVID-19 and poor mental health.","Nabe-Nielsen, Christensen, Fuglsang, Larsen, Nilsson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01806-8","20211018","COVID-19; Longitudinal studies; Mental health; Occupational health; School teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18988,""
"Targeting PSD95/nNOS by ZL006 alleviates social isolation-induced heightened attack behavior in mice","Deregulated attack behaviors have devastating social consequences; however, satisfactory clinical management for the behavior is still an unmet need so far. Social isolation (SI) has been common during the COVID-19 pandemic and may have detrimental effects on mental health, including eliciting heightened attack behavior. This study aims to explore whether injection of ZL006 can alleviate SI-induced escalation of attack behavior in mice. Pharmacological tools, biochemical methods, and behavioral tests were used to explore the potential therapeutic effects of ZL006 targeting postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95)/neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) pathway on escalation of attack behavior induced by SI in mice. ZL006 mitigated SI-induced escalated attack behaviors and elevated nitric oxide (NO) level in the cortex of the SI mice. The beneficial effects of ZL006 lasted for at least 72 h after a single injection of ZL006. Potentiation of NO levels by L-arginine blocked the effects of ZL006. Moreover, a sub-effective dose of 7-NI in combination with a sub-effective dose of ZL006 decreased both SI-induced escalated attack behaviors and NO levels in mice subjected to SI. Our study highlights the importance of the PSD95/nNOS pathway in mediating SI-induced escalation of attack behavior. ZL006 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating aggressive behaviors.","Yang, Cui, Zeng, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-021-06000-9","20211018","Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS); Nitric oxide (NO); Postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95); ResidentÃ¢â‚¬â€œintruder test; Social isolation (SI); ZL006","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18989,""
"Safety profile of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: a disproportionality analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database","The present study aims to identify potential safety signals of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), over the period preceding their repurpose as COVID-19 treatment options, through the analysis of safety data retrieved from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) pharmacovigilance database. We performed a disproportionality analysis of FAERS data between the first quarter of 2004 and December 2019 using the OpenVigil2.1-MedDRA software. Disproportionality was quantified using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and its 95% confidence interval (CIs). The reported mortality of CQ and HCQ was also investigated. The dataset contained 6,635,356 reports. Comparison of the RORs revealed significant differences between CQ and HCQ for the following adverse events: cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, retinal disorders, corneal disorders, hearing disorders, headache, hepatic disorders, severe cutaneous reactions, musculoskeletal disorders, and cytopenia. Only CQ was associated with psychotic disorders, suicide, self-injury, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy, and decreased appetite. In multivariable logistic regression, death was more frequently associated with CQ use, advanced age, male sex, co-reported suicide and self-injury, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased appetite. Our results confirm previously published evidence and suggest that HCQ has a safer clinical profile compared to CQ, and thus could serve as the drug of choice for future therapeutic purposes.","Papazisis, Siafis, Cepatyte, Giannis, Stamoula, Tzachanis, Egberts","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202110_26878","20211018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18990,""
"The prevalence of common mental disorders among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in unprecedented morbidity, mortality, and health system crisis leading to a significant psychological destress on healthcare workers (HCWs). The study aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic at St. Paul's Hospital, Ethiopia. A self-administered cross-sectional study was conducted to collect socio-demographic information and symptoms of mental disorders using validated measurement tools. Accordingly, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R were used to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Chi-square test,Ã‚Â non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect risk factors for common mental disorders. A total of 420 healthcare workers participated in the survey. The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress was 20.2%, 21.9%, 12.4%, and 15.5% respectively. Frontline HCWs had higher scores of mental health symptoms than non-frontline healthcare workers. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that being married was associated with a high level of depression. Furthermore, working in a frontline position was an independent risk factor associated with a high-level of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. It is a single-center cross-sectional study and the findings may not be nationally representative or reveal causality. A significant proportion of healthcare workers are suffering from symptoms of mental disorders. Frontline HCWs were at a greater risk of severe symptoms. Therefore, psychological interventions should be implemented to support health professionals, especially frontline workers.","Mulatu, Tesfaye, Woldeyes, Bayisa, Fisseha, Kassu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100246","20211019","Addis Ababa; COVID-19; Ethiopia; Health professional; Mental disorder; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18991,""
"The experiences and needs of re-entering nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","<b>Background:</b> During the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands, thousands of former nurses have returned to nursing to support healthcare staff. After a period of absence and with little time to prepare, these former nurses re-entered during a challenging, uncertain and rapidly evolving pandemic. Little is known about the experiences and needs of these re-entering nurses. <b>Objectives:</b> Assessing the needs and experiences of re-entering nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Design:</b> Qualitative study using a pragmatist approach within the interpretative paradigm. <b>Settings:</b> This study took place in the following settings within the Dutch healthcare system: Intensive care units, COVID and regular departments within hospitals, nursing home settings, a rehabilitation centre and newly established COVID-19 departments within nursing home settings. <b>Participants:</b> We purposively selected 20 nurses who had re-entered nursing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and June 2020 in the Netherlands. The first interview was conducted on the eighth of May 2020. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews in Dutch. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed via thematic content analysis in the coding program of MAXQDA2020. This study followed the SRQR and COREQ guidelines. <b>Results:</b> Seven main themes were identified. <i>Clear job description:</i> Participants mentioned that a lack of a clear job description led to lack of clarity about the kind of tasks that re-entering nurses were expected and allowed to perform. <i>Training:</i> the majority of the participants had received none or little training prior to their return. <i>Training content:</i> Re-entering nurses mentioned to wish for an easily accessible mentorship structure and an individualised and practical training program. <i>Positive team dynamic:</i> Re-entering nurses felt supported by a positive team dynamic, which was shaped by the sense of urgency and relevance of their work and helped them deal with stressful experiences. <i>Mental health:</i> Nearly all participants mentioned that re-entering during a pandemic did not lead to impairment of their mental health. <i>mental health support:</i> Most participants mentioned being able to cope with their mental health independently, sharing experiences with family and colleagues <b>Conclusion:</b> The results indicate that a rapid and safe return to nursing during a pandemic could be facilitated by: a clear description of roles and responsibilities; an individualised assessment determining the competences and knowledge disparities of re-entering nurses; practical training focussing on competencies needed during a pandemic; and a collaborative mentorship structure to guide re-entering nurses. <b>Tweetable abstract:</b> In-depth interviews with former nurses who returned to #nursing during the first wave of the #COVID19 #pandemic in the Netherlands.","Noorland, Hoekstra, Kok","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnsa.2021.100043","20211018","COVID-19; Capacity Building; Nursing Care Management; Nursing Staff; Pandemics; Workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18992,""

This article contextualizes and describes some of the major findings of that survey that reveal the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Hawai'i community agencies, service organizations, and the individuals they serve. Major issues for individuals served by the responding organizations included securing basic needs such as food and housing as well as access to health services, mental health needs, and COVID-19 concerns (such as inadequate personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies, quarantine, and testing issues). Respondents reported that job loss and the resulting financial problems were a root cause of personal strain among clients served. Community-level stress was related to the distressed economy and store closures. Fulfilling immediate and future needs of health and social service agencies and the individuals they serve, as articulated in this report, could dampen the effect of COVID-19, promote population wellbeing, and support community resilience.","Sentell, Choi, Maldonado, Oyama, Talana, Unciano, Arndt, Buenconsejo-Lum, Burrage, Qureshi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Hawai'i+Community+Agencies,+Service+Organizations,+and+the+Individuals+They+Serve:+A+Snapshot+from+a+Spring+2020+HI-EMA+Survey.","20211018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18993,""
"The Impact of the Online COVID-19 Infodemic on French Red Cross Actors' Field Engagement and Protective Behaviors: Mixed Methods Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been widely described as an infodemic, an excess of rapidly circulating information in social and traditional media in which some information may be erroneous, contradictory, or inaccurate. One key theme cutting across many infodemic analyses is that it stymies users' capacities to identify appropriate information and guidelines, encourages them to take inappropriate or even harmful actions, and should be managed through multiple transdisciplinary approaches. Yet, investigations demonstrating how the COVID-19 information ecosystem influences complex public decision making and behavior offline are relatively few. The aim of this study was to investigate whether information reported through the social media channel Twitter, linked articles and websites, and selected traditional media affected the risk perception, engagement in field activities, and protective behaviors of French Red Cross (FRC) volunteers and health workers in the Paris region of France from June to October 2020. We used a hybrid approach that blended online and offline data. We tracked daily Twitter discussions and selected traditional media in France for 7 months, qualitatively evaluating COVID-19 claims and debates about nonpharmaceutical protective measures. We conducted 24 semistructured interviews with FRC workers and volunteers. Social and traditional media debates about viral risks and nonpharmaceutical interventions fanned anxieties among FRC volunteers and workers. Decisions to continue conducting FRC field activities and daily protective practices were also influenced by other factors unrelated to the infodemic: familial and social obligations, gender expectations, financial pressures, FRC rules and communications, state regulations, and relationships with coworkers. Some respondents developed strategies for ""tuning out"" social and traditional media. This study suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the information ecosystem may be just one among multiple influences on one group's offline perceptions and behavior. Measures to address users who have disengaged from online sources of health information and who rely on social relationships to obtain information are needed. Tuning out can potentially lead to less informed decision making, leading to worse health outcomes.","Heyerdahl, Lana, Giles-Vernick","https://doi.org/10.2196/27472","20211019","COVID-19; epidemics; infodemics; medical anthropology; nongovernmental organizations; social listening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18994,""

Alpha intrusion was the most common EEG finding (78%), followed by cyclical alternating pattern (59%). REM density was significantly increased in 38% of patients. REM alpha bursts and increased spindles were also seen in 27% and 16%. Abnormal EEG waves are very commonly seen in COVID-19 survivors. Presence of these abnormal PSG-EEG waves hints that COVID-19 might have similar effects as depression, insomnia on these subjects, at least in short run. Whether these changes are temporary or permanent needs to be evaluated by performing serial polysomnographies in patients with COVID-19 ARDS.","Goyal, Saxena, Kar, Bhagtana, Sridevi, Chaudhary, Ali","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41782-021-00174-0","20211018","Alpha intrusion; COVID-19; Cyclical alternating pattern; Electroencephalography; Polysomnography; REM density","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18995,""
"Working together better for mental health in children and young people during a pandemic: experiences from North Central London during the first wave of COVID-19","Direct risk from infection from COVID-19 for children and young people (CYP) is low, but impact on services, education and mental health (so-called collateral damage) appears to have been more significant. In North Central London (NCL) during the first wave of the pandemic, in response to the needs and demands for adults with COVID-19, general paediatric wards in acute hospitals and some paediatric emergency departments were closed. Paediatric mental health services in NCL mental health services were reconfigured. Here we describe process and lessons learnt from a collaboration between physical and mental health services to provide care for CYP presenting in mental health crisis. Two new 'hubs' were created to coordinate crisis presentations in the region and to link community mental health teams with emergency departments. All CYP requiring a paediatric admission in the first wave were diverted to Great Ormond Street Hospital, a specialist children's hospital in NCL, and a new ward for CYP mental health crisis admissions was created. This brought together a multidisciplinary team of mental health and physical health professionals. The most common reason for admission to the ward was following a suicide attempt (n=17, 43%). Patients were of higher acute mental health complexity than usually admitted to the hospital, with some CYP needing an extended period of assessment. In this review, we describe the challenges and key lessons learnt for the development of this new ward setting that involved such factors as leadership, training and also new governance processes. We also report some personal perspectives from the professionals involved. Our review provides perspective and experience that can inform how CYP with mental health admissions can be managed in paediatric medical settings.","Gorny, Blackstock, Bhaskaran, Layther, Qoba, Vassar, Ellis, Begent, Forrester, Goldin, Hallet, Read, Hodges, Groszmann, Hudson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-001116","20211019","COVID-19 pandemic; North Central London; mental health; paediatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18996,""
"In-silico study on perovskites application in capturing and distorting coronavirus","The COVID-19 pandemic, known as coronavirus pandemic, a global pandemic, emerged from the beginning of 2020 and became dominant in many countries. As COVID-19 is one of the deadliest pandemics in history and has a high rate of distribution, a fast and extensive reaction was needed. Considering its composition, revealing the infection mechanism is beneficial for effective decisions against the spread and attack of COVID-19. Investigating data from numerous studies confirms that the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 occurs along with bonding spike protein (S protein) and through ACE2; Therefore, these two parts were the focus of research on the suppression and control of the infection. Performing lab research on all promising candidates requires years of experimental study, which is time-consuming and not an acceptable solution. Molecular dynamic simulation can decipher the performance of nano-structures in preventing the spread of coronavirus in a shorter time. This study surveyed the effect of three nano-perovskite structures (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, CaTiO<sub>3</sub>, and BaTiO<sub>3</sub>), a cutting-edge group of perovskite materials with outstanding properties on coronavirus. Various computational parameters evaluate the effectiveness of these structures. Results of the simulation indicated that SrTiO<sub>3</sub> performs better in SARS-CoV-2 suppression.","Khedri, Zandi, Ghasemy, Nikzad, Maleki, Rezaei","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100755","20211019","ACE2; COVID-19; Molecular dynamics; Nano-perovskite; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18997,""
"Predictors of Anxiety, Stress, and Concern of COVID-19 Infection in Older Adults During the First and the Second Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Slovakia","This cross-sectional online study examined the role of socio-demographic and psychological characteristics in predicting anxiety, stress, and concern of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in older adults during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. Six hundred and seven older adults (Sample 1) and 156 older adults (Sample 2) participated in the study during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The older adults completed a battery of validated instruments for anxiety, stress, concern of COVID-19 infection (outcome variables), satisfaction with health, perceived danger of COVID-19, loneliness, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), optimism, powerlessness, and coping self-efficacy (predictor variables). The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The older adults in both samples experienced moderate levels of anxiety, stress, and concern of COVID-19 infection. The greatest amount of variability in anxiety and stress was explained by powerlessness, IU, optimism, and coping self-efficacy. Concern of COVID-19 infection was best predicted by the perceived danger of COVID-19. The findings contribute to the existing knowledge about the mental health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the role of the psychological predictors of anxiety, stress, and concern of COVID-19 infection during both waves.","KÃƒÂ¶verovÃƒÂ¡, RÃƒÂ¡czovÃƒÂ¡, KovÃƒÂ¡Ã„ÂovÃƒÂ¡ HolevovÃƒÂ¡","https://doi.org/10.1177/23337214211047642","20211019","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; older adults; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18998,""
"Public Policy Responses to Address the Mental Health Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From Chile","<b>Objectives:</b> This paper reviews the mental health policies that have been implemented in Chile in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the international context of countries' responses. Even before the start of the pandemic, there were significant barriers to access mental health services in Chile, coupled with a scenario of nationwide social unrest and protests that questioned the legitimacy of public institutions; now the rapidly worsening outbreaks of COVID-19 are exacerbating the pre-existing mental health crisis. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a bibliometric and content analysis of the Chilean mental health public policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and then compared these policies with international experiences and emerging scientific evidence on the mental health impact of pandemics. <b>Results:</b> Our analysis of the policies identifies five crucial points of action developed in Chile: (i) an established framework to address mental health in emergency and disaster situations; (ii) a timely COVID-19 Mental Health Action Plan; (iii) inclusion of mental health in the public health agenda; (iv) development of a presidential strategy during the pandemic for comprehensive mental health and well-being; and (v) emerging research assessing the mental health implications of COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> In Chile, the public policy responses to address the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by the coordinated implementation of mental health plans, ranging from a health sectoral initiative to inter-agency and intersectoral efforts. However, it is imperative that increased funding is allocated to mental health, and efforts should be made to promote the participation of people with lived experiences and communities in the design and implementation of the proposed actions. This aspect could be of key importance to social peace and community recovery after the pandemic.","Irarrazaval, Norambuena, Montenegro, Toro-Devia, Vargas, Caqueo-UrÃƒÂ­zar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.590335","20211018","COVID-19; Latin America; health policies; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",18999,""
"Parental Stress, Depression, and Participation in Care Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Observational Study in an Italian Neonatal Intensive Care Unit","<b>Background:</b> Recent studies reported, during the COVID-19 pandemic, increased mental distress among the general population and among women around the childbirth period. COVID-19 pandemic may undermine the vulnerable well-being of parents in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). <b>Objective:</b> Our study aimed to explore whether parental stress, depression, and participation in care in an Italian NICU changed significantly over three periods: pre-pandemic (T<sub>0</sub>), low (T<sub>1</sub>), and high COVID-19 incidence (T<sub>2</sub>). <b>Methods:</b> Enrolled parents were assessed with the Parental Stressor Scale in the NICU (PSS:NICU), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and Index of Parental Participation (IPP). Stress was the study primary outcome. A sample of 108 parents, 34 for each time period, was estimated to be adequate to detect a difference in PSS:NICU stress occurrence level score (SOL) of 1.25 points between time periods. To estimate score differences among the three study periods a non-parametric analysis was performed. Correlation among scores was assessed with Spearman rank coefficient. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 152 parents were included in the study (62 in T<sub>0</sub>, 56 in T<sub>1</sub>, and 34 in T<sub>2</sub>). No significant differences in the median PSS:NICU, EPDS, and IPP scores were observed over the three periods, except for a slight increase in the PSS:NICU parental role sub-score in T<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>0</sub> 3.3 [2.3-4.1] vs. T<sub>2</sub> 3.9 [3.1-4.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.038). In particular, the question regarding the separation from the infant resulted the most stressful aspect during T<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>0</sub> 4.0 [4.0-5.0] vs. T<sub>2</sub> 5.0 [4.0-5.0], <i>p</i> = 0.008). The correlation between participation and stress scores (<i>r</i> = 0.19-022), and between participation and depression scores (<i>r</i> = 0.27) were weak, while among depression and stress, a moderate positive correlation was found (<i>r</i> = 0.45-0.48). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study suggests that parental stress and depression may be contained during the COVID-19 pandemic, while participation may be ensured.","Bua, Mariani, Girardelli, Tomadin, Tripani, Travan, Lazzerini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.737089","20211019","COVID-19; depression; neonatal ICU; parents; participation; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19000,""
"Call for departments of public health at all medical colleges in India","Public Health has always been important for the general public, governments, and governance as it deals with the objective of improving population health through prevention, promotion, and health education. Public Health is defined as ""the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society"" (Acheson, 1988; WHO). The COVID 19 pandemic has brought a focus on the concept of public health more than ever. Independent departments of Public Health do not exist at medical colleges in India. Public health is a multidisciplinary domain. The body of knowledge is cross-cutting and multidimensional in nature. Public health education is optimal only with the contribution of the participating faculty from different educational and professional backgrounds. Lack of strong public health academics may adversely impact the capacity to formulate indigenous public health policy. In many parts of the developing world, public health policies are heavily influenced by the knowledge developed by the western universities within the domain of global health. Global health policies and goals become synonymous with national health goals. For the democratic republic of India, there is an urgent need to strengthen the public health education system so that the future challenges of health, safety, economy, security can be met The National Medical Commission (NMC) has invited comments on the draft postgraduate medical education regulations 2021. It is an apt opportunity to fundamentally reform public health education in India.","Kumar","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1674_21","20211019","COVID Pandemic; Community Medicine; Health Policy; MPH; Medical Education Reforms; National Medical Commission; Public Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19001,""

However, the nasopharyngeal swab testing process may cause some discomfort. To investigate the influence of nasopharyngeal swab tests on the anxiety and pain felt by psychiatric medical staff. A total of 174 psychiatric medical staff (namely 97 doctors, 68 nurses, and nine administrators) and 27 controls were included in the current study. A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect their general demographic information (age, gender, marriage, occupation, profession, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, tea drinking history, previous history of anxiety and depression) as well as their subjective experience, such as nausea, vomiting, coughing, worry, fear, etc, during nasopharyngeal swab collection. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to assess the subjects' pain and state anxiety, respectively. There were no statistical differences (p&gt;0.05) in age, marriage, smoking history, a history of anxiety and depression, pain scores, and anxiety scores between different professions and genders. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the male gender was negatively correlated with being anxious (r=-0.148, p=0.037) and nervous (r=-0.171 p=0.016), although there was no significant difference in pain and anxiety between men and women. In addition, marriage might help women resist negative emotions. 1) There will be mild discomfort during nucleic acid testing, but not enough to cause pain and anxiety; 2) women are more likely to be anxious and nervous during the nucleic acid testing.","Li, Zhou, Guo, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.592092","20211018","COVID-19; anxious; nasopharyngeal swab test; nervous; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19002,""
"Fear of COVID-19 and religious coping mediate the associations between religiosity and distress among older adults","<b>Background:</b> A mediation model was proposed to explain how religiosity, religious coping, and fear of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) explained anxiety and depression among older adults. <b>Methods:</b> With the use of a cross-sectional design, the Integrated Health System was used to randomly invite 1000 older adults residing in Qazvin to participate in an online survey. Within the period of November 2020 to January 2021, 696 older Iranian adults (mean age=69.56years; 57.9% women) agreed to participate in the study and reported demographic information as well as measures of religiosity, fear of COVID-19, religious coping, anxiety, and depression. <b>Results:</b> Religiosity had direct effects on depression (B [SE]=-0.087 [0.037]; P=0.023) but not anxiety (B [SE]=-0.063 [0.036]; P=0.072).

"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health calls for police service","Drawing upon seven years of police calls for service data (2014-2020), this study examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on calls involving persons with perceived mental illness (PwPMI) using a Bayesian Structural Time Series. The findings revealed that PwPMI calls did not increase immediately after the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020.

Ultimately, the analysis revealed a 22% increase in PwPMI calls during the COVID-19 pandemic than would have been expected had the pandemic not taken place. The delayed effect of the pandemic on such calls points to a need for policymakers to prioritize widely accessible mental health care that can be deployed early during public health emergencies thus potentially mitigating or eliminating the need for increased police intervention, as was the case here.

"COVID-19 Is Associated With an Increase in Visits for Anxiety but Not Depression","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased concerns about mental health. We conducted a time-series analysis to determine whether the percentage of primary care visits for anxiety and depression changed after COVID-19. Methodology We assessed the adjusted weekly change in the percentage of primary care visits for anxiety and depression between August 2019 and October 2020 at a large integrated health system. To account for changes in overall visit behavior during the pandemic, we created three periods: pre-period (August 1, 2019 to March 8, 2020), initial period (March 9, 2020 to June 31, 2020), and return period (July 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020). We used hierarchical linear regression models (clustered by month) to identify the association between the time period and the adjusted mean weekly percentage of visits for depression or anxiety. We conducted the analysis in 2020 and 2021. Results There were 1,691,071 encounters among 605,105 unique adults. The median age was 55 years (interquartile range = 39-68), 57% were female, 78% were white, and 59% had private insurance. Most visits were office-based (versus virtual), of which 99% were in the pre-COVID-19 period and 75% in the return period. There was a significant increase in the percentage of visits associated with anxiety after July compared to before COVID-19 (10.4% versus 9.2%; p = 0.006), and there was no difference in the percentage of visits for depression (p &gt; 0.05).

"Study of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome in Saudi Arabia","Background Post-COVID-19 syndrome may be predisposed by organ damage as a complication of COVID-19. Patients may experience persistent symptomsÃ‚Â afterÃ‚Â recovering from their initial illness. Objectives To identify manifestations and predisposing factors for post-COVID-19 syndrome in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2021 through June 2021 using an online structured pre-coded closed-ended, pilot-tested questionnaire in Arabic. It included male and female inhabitants of Saudi Arabia aged 18 years and above with a past history of COVID-19 infection. Descriptive statistics were carried out for all variables. A univariate analysis Chi-square test and independent t-test were used. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 85.3% of post-COVID-19 cases had general manifestations: 77.3% had musculoskeletal and joint complaints, 61.3% had mental and psychological problems, 58.7% had gastrointestinal manifestations, 44% had renal complaints, 41.3% had respiratory complaints, and 36.0% had cardiovascular symptoms.

"Pulmonary Function, Mental and Physical Health in Recovered COVID-19 Patients Requiring Invasive Versus Non-invasive Oxygen Therapy: A Prospective Follow-Up Study Post-ICU Discharge","Background Survivors of COVID-19 pneumonia may have residual lung injury and poor physical and mental health even after discharge. We hypothesized that COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients needing mechanical ventilation may be at a greater risk of deterioration in pulmonary function, mental health, and quality of life (QOL). This study analyses the differences in pulmonary function, mental health, and QOL after recovery, in patients having received non-invasive oxygen therapy versus invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay. Methods Patients aged &gt;18 years, who had completed 3 months post ICU discharge, with moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS, were consecutively enrolled from May 1 to July 31, 2021. Patients were allocated into Group A - having required high flow nasal cannula (HFNC)/non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and Group B -Ã‚Â having received invasive mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), and health-related quality of life were compared. Results Of the 145 eligible patients, 31 were lost to follow-up and 21 died. Seventy-four patients were allocated into Groups A (57 patients) and B (17 patients). In Group A, abnormal forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in mid-half of FVC (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) values were obtained in 27 (47.37%), 43 (75.44%), 11 (19.3%), and 25 (43.86%) patients, and in Group B, in 13 (76.47%), 17 (100%), 1 (5.88%), and 8 (47%) patients, respectively. No patient had abnormal FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC. All Group B patients had a restrictive pattern in spirometry as compared to 77% in Group A. Group B had a lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) (p=0.0019), % predicted FVCÃ‚Â (p&lt;0.0001), % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>Ã‚Â (p=0.001), and 6-MWT distance (p&lt;0.001). The physical component score in the short-form survey 12 questionnaire was higher in group A, p&lt;0.001, whereas the mental component score was comparable. Conclusions Patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) have a greater risk of impaired pulmonary function and reduced QOL post-ICU discharge. This warrants a greater need for following these patients for better rehabilitation.","Hazarika, Mahajan, Kajal, Ray, Singla, Sehgal, Bhalla, Singh, Naik, Kaloria, Saini, Singh, Kumar, Biswas, Soni, Bhagat, Singh, Puri","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17756","20211018","6-minute walk test; acute respiratory distress syndrome [ards]; covid-19; follow-up study; health-related quality of life; respiratory function tests","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19011,""
"Depression Relapse during Long-Term Remission due to Media-Amplified Fear during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reoriented societies across the world and placed a significant burden on caring for mental health among its population. In this study, we reported two cases where patients experiencing severe depression with delusions of having COVID-19 required inpatient treatment after long-term remission owing to the negative impact of media reports related to the pandemic. Despite the aggravation of their anxiety, the patients were unable to distance themselves from negative information in attempts to remain informed through media to prevent their families and themselves from being infected. Self-protection through improved media literacy is imperative for people to protect themselves from the fearmongering of the media and infodemic in the present-day scenario.","Ayani, Matsuoka, Yamano, Narumoto","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5682611","20211018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19012,""
"Pre-hospital, in-hospital and post-hospital factors associated with sleep quality among COVID-19 survivors 6 months after hospital discharge: cross-sectional survey in five cities in China","Understanding factors associated with post-discharge sleep quality among COVID-19 survivors is important for intervention development. This study investigated sleep quality and its correlates among COVID-19 patients 6 months after their most recent hospital discharge. Healthcare providers at hospitals located in five different Chinese cities contacted adult COVID-19 patients discharged between 1 February and 30 March 2020. A total of 199 eligible patients provided verbal informed consent and completed the interview. Using score on the single-item Sleep Quality Scale as the dependent variable, multiple linear regression models were fitted. Among all participants, 10.1% reported terrible or poor sleep quality, and 26.6% reported fair sleep quality, 26.1% reported worse sleep quality when comparing their current status with the time before COVID-19, and 33.7% were bothered by a sleeping disorder in the past 2 weeks. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, factors associated with sleep quality included witnessing the suffering (adjusted B = -1.15, 95% CI = -1.70, -0.33) or death (adjusted B = -1.55, 95% CI = -2.62, -0.49) of other COVID-19 patients during hospital stay, depressive symptoms (adjusted B = -0.26, 95% CI = -0.31, -0.20), anxiety symptoms (adjusted B = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.33, -0.17), post-traumatic stress disorders (adjusted B = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.22, -0.10) and social support (adjusted B = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.10). COVID-19 survivors reported poor sleep quality. Interventions and support services to improve sleep quality should be provided to COVID-19 survivors during their hospital stay and after hospital discharge.","Fu, Fang, Luo, Wang, Xiao, Hu, Ju, Zheng, Xu, Yang, Chan, Xu, Chen, He, Zhu, Tang, Huang, Hong, Ma, Hao, Cai, Yang, Ye, Yuan, Chen, Xiao, Wang, Zou","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1008","20211018","COVID-19 survivors; China; in-hospital factors; post-hospital factors; pre-hospital factors; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19013,""
"Prevalence of mental illness among COVID-19 survivors in South Korea: nationwide cohort","Mental illness among survivors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) during the post-illness period is an emerging and important health issue. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental illness and the associated factors for its development among COVID-2019 survivors. From 1 January to 4 June 2020, data were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service COVID-19 database in South Korea. Patients with COVID-19 were defined as those whose test results indicated that they had contracted the infection, regardless of disease severity. COVID-19 survivors were defined as those who recovered from the infection. The primary end-point was the development of mental illness, which was evaluated between 1 January and 1 December 2020. A total 260 883 individuals were included in this study, and 2.36% (6148) were COVID-19 survivors. The COVID-19 survivors showed higher prevalence of mental illness than the control group (12.0% in the COVID-19 survivors <i>v.</i> 7.7% in the control group; odds ratio (OR) = 2.40, 95% CI 2.21-2.61, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Additionally, compared with the control group, the no specific treatment for COVID-19 group (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 2.03-2.45, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and specific treatment for COVID-19 group (OR = 3.27, 95% CI 2.77-3.87, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) showed higher prevalence of mental illness among survivors. In South Korea, COVID-19 survivors had a higher risk of developing mental illness compared with the rest of the populations. Moreover, this trend was more evident in COVID-19 survivors who experienced specific treatment in the hospital.","Park, Song, Lee, Sim, Oh, Song, Yu, Park, Oh","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1001","20211018","Anxiety disorders; depressive disorders; epidemiology; post-traumatic stress disorder; risk assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19014,""
"Depression, dietary intake, and body image during coronavirus disease 2019 quarantine in Peru: An online cross-sectional study","The coronavirus disease 2019 affects the psychological well-being of populations. In the same way, it can be a potential threat to body image. The aim of the study was to explore associations between depressive symptoms, dietary intake, and body image during coronavirus disease 2019 quarantine. An online cross-sectional study was conducted in 589 Peruvian adults, 297 men (50.4%) and 292 women (49.6%). The mean age was 30.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (range: 18-59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Participants completed three questionnaires, including a food frequency questionnaire, the Body Shape Questionnaire, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Moreover, sociodemographic data were collected. The data were analyzed using the statistical software IBM SPSS version 24, and the chi-square test was used. A significance level of 5% was considered. A total of 37.7% and 43.6% of the women reported depressive symptoms and dissatisfaction with body image, respectively. Depressive symptoms were associated with dietary intake and dissatisfaction with body image (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Dissatisfaction with body image was associated with dietary intake (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Depressive symptomatology plays an important role in the dietary intake and body image of the study population. It is suggested to address these factors through the implementation of health campaign programs and personalized therapeutic interventions.","LeÃƒÂ³n-Paucar, CalderÃƒÂ³n-Olivos, Calizaya-Milla, Saintila","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211051914","20211018","Coronavirus disease 2019; Peru; body image; depression; eating habits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19015,""
"Helping patients connect remotely with their loved ones modulates distress in healthcare workers: a tend-and-befriend hypothesis for COVID-19 front liners","The no-visitor policies endorsed by healthcare organizations to limit COVID-19 virus risk exposure have unfortunately contributed to the isolation of patients further exacerbating distress in relatives and frontline healthcare workers. To contrast such effects, many healthcare institutions have adopted technology-based solutions helping patients and families communicate online through the aid of virtual devices. To date, no study has investigated whether facilitating patient-family videocalls would mitigate distress levels in frontline healthcare professionals. Caring for emotional needs of patients by re-establishing affiliative connections interrupted by the pandemic through patient-family videocalls is expected to mitigate distress in engaged healthcare workers as an example of a tend-and-befriend response to stress caused by the pandemic. We tested this hypothesis in a cross-sectional study conducted during 1-30 June 2020, involving 209 healthcare workers (nursesÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 146; physiciansÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 63) engaged in the COVID-19 frontline in Italy. Half of participants in our sample (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 107) had assisted efforts aimed at connecting patients remotely with families through videocalls. Psychological distress measures included symptoms of burnout, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and difficulty in sleep and wakefulness. Partially in line with our expectations we found a modulation effect specific for professional category: nurses assisting patient-family videocalls reported significantly lower levels of distress and a better quality of wakefulness compared to those who did not, whereas physicians reported higher levels of distress during such virtual communications. We interpret these findings from the perspective of patient-family communication and differences in skills and training between nurses and physicians. These findingsÃ‚Â highlight that technology-based solutions aimed at reducing barriers and alleviating distress in healthcare settings should be promoted in concert with skill enhancement training for healthcare professionals especially in terms of communicating online and communicating difficult topics with patients and families. La polÃƒÂ­tica de no recibir visitas que ha sido legitimada por organizaciones de atenciÃƒÂ³n de salud para limitar el riesgo de la exposiciÃƒÂ³n al virus COVID-19 ha contribuido en forma desafortunada al aislamiento de los pacientes, lo que aumenta el malestar/angustia en familiares y en trabajadores de salud de la primera lÃƒÂ­nea. Para contrastar tales efectos, muchas instituciones de salud han adoptado soluciones basadas en la tecnologÃƒÂ­a para ayudar a pacientes y familiares a comunicarse en lÃƒÂ­nea a travÃƒÂ©s de la ayuda de dispositivos virtuales. Hasta la fecha, ningÃƒÂºn estudio ha investigado si es que la facilitaciÃƒÂ³n de video llamadas paciente-familiares pudiese mitigar el nivel de angustia en profesionales de salud de primera lÃƒÂ­nea. Se espera que el cuidado de las necesidades emocionales de los pacientes mediante el restablecimiento de conexiones afilativas interrumpidas por la pandemia a travÃƒÂ©s de video llamadas entre el paciente y la familia ayude a mitigar la angustia en los trabajadores de la salud como un ejemplo de una respuesta de Ã¢â‚¬Å“cuidar y hacer amigosÃ¢â‚¬Â a la angustia causada por la pandemia. Probamos esta hipÃƒÂ³tesis en un estudio transversal realizado entre el 01 y el 30 de junio del 2020, en la que participaron 209 trabajadores de la salud (enfermeras=146; mÃƒÂ©dicos=63) involucrados en la atenciÃƒÂ³n de la primera lÃƒÂ­nea del COVID-19 en Italia. La mitad de los participantes en nuestra muestra (<i>n</i>=107) habÃƒÂ­an asistido a esfuerzos destinados a conectar a los pacientes en forma remota con sus familias a travÃƒÂ©s de video-llamadas. Las medidas de angustia psicolÃƒÂ³gica incluyeron sÃƒÂ­ntomas de burnout, estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico, ansiedad, depresiÃƒÂ³n, dificultad para dormir y estar despiertos. Parcialmente en lÃƒÂ­nea con nuestras expectativas, encontramos un efecto modulador especÃƒÂ­fico para la categorÃƒÂ­a profesional: Las enfermeras que asistÃƒÂ­an las video llamadas de los pacientes con sus familias reportaron significativamente menor nivel de angustia y una mejor calidad de vigilia en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con las que no lo hicieron, mientras los mÃƒÂ©dicos reportaron mayores niveles de angustia durante tales comunicaciones virtuales. Interpretamos estos hallazgos desde la perspectiva de la comunicaciÃƒÂ³n paciente-familia y las diferencias en las habilidades y formaciÃƒÂ³n entre las enfermeras y los mÃƒÂ©dicos. Estos hallazgos destacan que las soluciones basadas en la tecnologÃƒÂ­a destinadas a reducir las barreras y aliviar la angustia en los entornos de atenciÃƒÂ³n de salud deben promoverse junto con la capacitaciÃƒÂ³n para la mejora de habilidades para profesionales de la salud especialmente en tÃƒÂ©rminos de comunicarse en lÃƒÂ­nea y comunicar temÃƒÂ¡ticas difÃƒÂ­ciles a pacientes y familiares.

"Capturing the Trajectory of Psychological Status and Analyzing Online Public Reactions During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Through Weibo Posts in China","When a major, sudden infectious disease occurs, people tend to react emotionally and display reactions such as tension, anxiety, fear, depression, and somatization symptoms. Social media played a substantial awareness role in developing countries during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to analyze public opinion regarding COVID-19 and to explore the trajectory of psychological status and online public reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic by examining online content from Weibo in China. This study consisted of three steps: first, Weibo posts created during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; second, public sentiment orientation was classified as ""optimistic/pessimistic/neutral"" orientation <i>via</i> natural language processing and manual determination procedures; and third, qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to reveal the trajectory of public psychological status and online public reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public psychological status differed in different periods of the pandemic (from December 2019 to May 2020). The newly confirmed cases had an almost 1-month lagged effect on public psychological status. Among the 15 events with high impact indexes or related to government decisions, there were 10 optimism orientation &gt; pessimism orientation (OP) events (2/3) and 5 pessimism orientation &gt; optimism orientation (PO) events (1/3). Among the top two OP events, the high-frequency words were ""race against time"" and ""support,"" while in the top two PO events, the high-frequency words were ""irrationally purchase"" and ""pass away."" We proposed a hypothesis that people developed negative self-perception when they received PO events, but their cognition was developed by how these external stimuli were processed and evaluated. These results offer implications for public health policymakers on understanding public psychological status from social media. This study demonstrates the benefits of promoting psychological healthcare and hygiene activity in the early period and improving risk perception for the public based on public opinion and the coping abilities of people. Health managers should focus on disseminating socially oriented strategies to improve the policy literacy of Internet users, thereby facilitating the disease prevention work for the COVID-19 pandemic and other major public events.","Chiang, Chu, Lin, Cai, Chen, Wang, Li, Rui, Zhang, Xie, Lee, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744691","20211018","COVID-19; China; psychological status; public opinion; public reactions; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19017,""
"Maternal Stress, Depression, and Attachment in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Before and During the COVID Pandemic: An Exploratory Study","The main aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mothers' postnatal depression, stress, and attachment during their stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Twenty mothers of very premature infants born before 32weeks of gestational age were recruited at the Geneva University Hospital between January 2018 and February 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Mothers were screened for postnatal depression after their preterm infant's birth (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS), then for stress (Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, PSS:NICU), and attachment (Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale, MPAS) at infant's term-equivalent age. Data were compared with 14 mothers recruited between November 2020 and June 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. No significant differences were found in the scores for depression, stress, and attachment between the two groups. However, a non-statistically significant trend showed a general increase of depression symptoms in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly correlated to the attachment and stress scores. Moreover, the PSS:NICU Sights and Sounds score was significantly positively correlated with EPDS scores and negatively with the MPAS score only in the During-COVID group. To conclude, we discussed a possible dampened effect of the several protective family-based actions that have been adopted in the Geneva University Hospital during the health crisis, and we discussed the most appropriate interventions to support parents in this traumatic period during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Manuela, Barcos-Munoz, Monaci, Lordier, Camejo, De Almeida, Grandjean, HÃƒÂ¼ppi, Borradori-Tolsa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.734640","20211018","COVID pandemic; attachment; maternal depression; maternal stress; neonatal intensive care unit; preterm infants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19018,""
"Association Between Fear of COVID-19 and Emotional Distress in Nurses With Mediating Role of Socio-Demographic Features","<b>Objectives:</b> To determine the predictive association between fear of COVID-19 and emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) in frontline and non-frontline nurses. To explore the mediating role of socio-demographic features. <b>Methods:</b> Correlational cross-sectional research design was implied. A total of 500 on-duty male and female, frontline and non-frontline, nurses were included from five major hospitals in Gujrat (Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Hospital, City Hospital, Doctors Hospital, Akram Hospital, and Gujrat Hospital). Fear of COVID-19 scale and the Urdu version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale - 21 (DASS-21) were used to measure variables of interest. Descriptive statistics, structural equation modeling (SEM), linear regression, and <i>t</i>-test were carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 21. <b>Result:</b> Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed a significant predictive link between fear of COVID-19 and depression, anxiety, and stress (goodness of model fit; NFI = 0.93, GFI = 0.914, AGFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.936, and IFI = 0.936). Furthermore, a significant mediating effect of certain demographic features was discovered by SEM (CMIN/DF = 1.11, NFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.98, GFI = 0.08, AGFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.029, CFI = 0.99, and IFI = 0.99). Results of linear regression analysis also revealed a momentous predictive association between fear of COVID-19 and emotional distress (<i>R</i> = 0.860). In comparative analysis, the results of t-test explored the statistical significant difference in fear of COVID-19 and emotional distress between frontline (mean = 25.775, 36.147 and SD = 1.75, 2.23) and non-frontline nurses (mean = 21.702, 27.353 and SD = 4.607, 10.212), with <i>t</i> <sub>(130)</sub> =7.111, 6.92. <b>Conclusion:</b> Managing the mediating effect of demographic characteristics and reducing the fear of COVID-19 can help nurses to overcome emotional distress, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Further, this will increase the productivity among nurses.","Abid, Riaz, Bano, Parveen, Umar Fayyaz, Sadia Qureshi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.734623","20211018","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; emotional distress; linear aggression; socio-demographic features; stress; structural equation modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19019,""
"Late Adulthood, COVID-19-Related Stress Perceptions, Meaning in Life, and Forgiveness as Predictors of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this study was to examine multiple direct and indirect pathways of the association between older age and mental health through COVID-19-related stress perceptions, meaning in life, and forgiveness of situations. Participants were 1,382 U.S. adults who were part of the Harvard Digital Lab for the Social Sciences panel who volunteered to complete a 12 min survey in the spring of 2020. The sample had an average age of 56 years, was slightly more male (55%) than female (44%) or other (2%), mostly White (88%), well-educated (70% bachelors degree or more), and middle-income ($60,000-$75,000 annually). Measures included: COVID-19-related stress perceptions (e.g., concerns about infection, job, lack of necessities), presence of and search for meaning in life, forgiveness of situations, psychological distress, hopelessness, and optimism. A latent mental health variable was created that was comprised of psychological distress, hopelessness, and optimism. All hypothesized direct effects were in evidence, and all but one indirect effect were observed. Specifically, older age was related to better mental health through higher presence of meaning and lower search for meaning. Older age was also related to better mental health through a serial indirect pathway from lower COVID-19-related stress perceptions to higher presence of and lower search for meaning and higher forgiveness of situations to mental health. The proposed model was largely supported and confirms existing theory and research on aging, positive psychological processes, and mental health. Findings also offer new insights on the unique potential role of forgiveness of situations and its theoretical relevance to offending situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study offers a beginning for theorists, researchers, and practitioners to consider the connections between aging and mental health and the intricate interconnections between stress appraisal and positive coping resources that may serve to support it.","Toussaint, Cheadle, Dezutter, Williams","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.731017","20211018","COVID-19; forgiveness; late adulthood; meaning in life; mental health; old age; stress appraisals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19020,""
"Remote Work Decreases Psychological and Physical Stress Responses, but Full-Remote Work Increases Presenteeism","<b>Introduction:</b> Remote work was widely promoted in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effects of remote work on psychological and physical stress responses and presenteeism of workers remain unclear. This research aims to provide empirical evidence of the implications for people and organizations of this new scenario of working from home. <b>Methods:</b> A two-wave panel survey of before and after the pandemic was performed to investigate the effects of remote work on these aspects among office workers. A total of 3,123 office workers from 23 tertiary industries responded to a questionnaire. Participants were surveyed about their job stress conditions and sleep practices in both 2019 and 2020, who had not done remote work as of 2019 were included in the study. The effects of remote work on psychological and physical stress responses and presenteeism were analyzed by multivariate analysis, with the adjustment of age, gender, overtime, job stressors, social support, and sleep status. <b>Results:</b> The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that remote work was associated with the reduction of psychological and physical stress responses independently of changes of job stressors, social support, sleep disturbance, and total sleep time on workdays. On the other hand, remote work of 5 days a week (full-remote) was associated with the reduction of work productivity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Promoting remote work can reduce psychological and physical stress responses, however, full-remote work has the risk of worsening presenteeism. From the viewpoint of mental health, the review of working styles is expected to have positive effects, even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shimura, Yokoi, Ishibashi, Akatsuka, Inoue","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.730969","20211018","COVID-19; job stress; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; occupational mental health; presenteeism; remote work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19021,""
"Emotional and Behavioral Changes in Older Adults With High Risk of Cognitive Impairment During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 is not only a threat to physical health but also a stressor to mental health, particularly for older adults. Previous studies have indicated that healthy older adults have resilience to cope with such stressful event through emotional and behavioral effort. However, very few have investigated the coping ability of older adults with High Risk of Cognitive Impairment (HRCI), as they are characterized with risk factors that can make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 in both physical and mental aspects. To examine whether older adults with HRCI were able to cope with and recover from the outbreak of COVID-19, we investigated the changes of their self-reported emotional states and intentions of taking protective behaviors between the outbreak period (data collected from February 17th to 24th, 2020) and the remission period (data collected from April 7th to 20th, 2020). The results showed that compared with the outbreak period, older adults with HRCI showed better emotional states and higher levels of intention to take more protective behaviors during the remission period. Subgroup analysis showed that even those who showed relatively poor coping abilities during the outbreak period could gradually improve their emotional states and intend to take more protective behaviors later on in the remission period. Therefore, these results suggested that older adults with HRCI were able to cope with and recover from the pandemic outbreak.","Fu, Liu, Li, Ma, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719774","20211018","COVID-19; emotional states; high risk of cognitive impairment; mental health; older adults; protective behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19022,""
"Predictors of Persistence of Anxiety, Hyperarousal Stress, and Resilience During the COVID-19 Epidemic: A National Study in Iran","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus pandemic can cause unprecedented global anxiety, and, in contrast, resilience can help the mental health of people in stressful situations. This study aimed to assess anxiety, hyperarousal stress, the resilience of the Iranian population, and their related factors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted in 31 provinces in Iran between March 18 and 25, 2020. A four-part questionnaire, including the demographic information, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-y1-a 20-item standard questionnaire for obvious anxiety), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-a 25 item standard questionnaire), and the stress hyperarousal subscale from the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), was used to collect data. The ordinal multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to identify correlates of the psychological factors mentioned above. The Fisher exact test was used to investigate the relationship between anxiety, stress, resilience, and the COVID-19 outbreak. All analyses were conducted with SPSS 26 and GIS 10.71. <b>Results:</b> The findings show that most people had moderate-to-severe anxiety (80.17%) and a high level of resilience (96.4%) during the COVID-19 epidemic. The majority of participants had a moderate level of stress (58.9%). The lowest and highest prevalences of psychiatric disorders were in Sistan and Baluchestan (3.14 cases per 100,000 people) and Semnan (75.9 cases per 100,000 people) provinces, respectively. Men and unmarried people were the only variables significantly associated with anxiety and resilience.

"High Sitting Time Is a Behavioral Risk Factor for Blunted Improvement in Depression Across 8 Weeks of the COVID-19 Pandemic in April-May 2020","The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited increased sedentary behaviors, decreased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and worsened mental health, yet the longitudinal impact of these changes and their inter-relations remains unknown. Our purpose was to examine associations between changes in self-reported activity behaviors and mental health over an 8-week period following the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants from all 50 states and the District of Colombia were recruited through convenience and snowball sampling at baseline April 3-10, 2020. Prospective data from 2,327 US adults with Ã¢â€°Â¥2 responses (63.8% female; 74.3% response rate) were collected weekly via online survey for eight consecutive weeks (April 3-June 3, 2020). Primary exposures were self-reported time spent sitting, viewing screens and in MVPA, with primary outcomes being depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and positive mental health (PMH). A significant sitting-by-time interaction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) showed slightly higher marginal effects for depressive symptoms for the 90th-percentile of sitting time than the 10th-percentile at baseline (5.8 [95% confidence interval = 5.5-6.2] vs. 5.7 [5.4-6.1]), with the difference magnifying over time (week 8: 3.5 [3.2-3.9] vs. 2.7 [2.4-2.9]). No other interactions over time were significant. Screen time was negatively associated with PMH and positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Sitting time was negatively associated with PMH (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Rapid changes in sitting patterns (e.g., due to a pandemic) may have lasting effects on depressive symptoms. Strategies targeting those most affected (i.e., young adults, females) and/or focused on reducing sitting time may be critical for preventing long-term mental health effects resulting from COVID-19 or other large-scale behavior changes in the general population.","Meyer, O'Connor, McDowell, Lansing, Brower, Herring","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.741433","20211018","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; exercise; longitudinal; positive mental health; screen time; sedentary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19024,""
"The Psychological Effect of Internet-Based Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on the Survivors of Breast Cancer During the COVID-19","<b>Objective:</b> To examine the efficacy and the role of engagement of an internet-based Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (iMBSR) for survivors of breast cancer (BC) during the COVID-19 period from January to March in 2020 in China. <b>Methods:</b> 48 survivors of BC were divided into the absentees group and the iMBSR groups according to their attending to the standardized, group-based, 8-week iMBSR. Based on practice time, survivors of BC in the iMBSR were categorized into three subgroups: group 1 (&lt;30 min/day), group 2 (30-60 min/day), and group 3 (&gt;60 min/day). In addition, participants were classified as partial attendees (&lt;4 sessions) and completers (more than 4 sessions) of the iMBSR groups. All participants were evaluated for symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia at baseline, mid-intervention, and post-intervention. <b>Results:</b> After an 8-week iMBSR practice, at mid-intervention and post-intervention, participants in iMBSR group had significant improvement in scores and reduction rates of depression, anxiety, and insomnia compared to absentees. Scores of depression and insomnia, reduction rates of depression at post-intervention, scores of anxiety, reduction rates of anxiety and insomnia at mid-intervention and post-intervention, had significant differences among subgroups of practice time. Daily practice time was positively related to reduction rates of depression, anxiety and insomnia at post-intervention in the iMBSR group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Internet-based MBSR showed efficacy in reducing psychological symptoms among survivors of BC.

"Network Analysis of Depressive Symptoms Among Residents of Wuhan in the Later Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Depression has been a common mental health problem during the COVID-19 epidemic. From a network perspective, depression can be conceptualized as the result of mutual interactions among individual symptoms, an approach that may elucidate the structure and mechanisms underlying this disorder. This study aimed to examine the structure of depression among residents in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, in the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 2,515 participants were recruited from the community via snowball sampling. The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported depressive symptoms with the QuestionnaireStar program. The network structure and relevant centrality indices of depression were examined in this sample. <b>Results:</b> Network analysis revealed Fatigue, Sad mood, Guilt and Motor disturbances as the most central symptoms, while Suicide and Sleep problems had the lowest centrality. No significant differences were found between women and men regarding network structure (maximum difference = 0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.44) and global strength (global strength difference = 0.04; female vs. male: 3.78 vs. 3.83, <i>p</i> = 0.51), a finding that suggests there are no gender differences in the structure or centrality of depressive symptoms. <b>Limitations:</b> Due to the cross-sectional study design, causal relationships between these depressive symptoms or dynamic changes in networks over time could not be established. <b>Conclusions:</b> Fatigue, Sad mood, Guilt, and Motor disturbances should be prioritized as targets in interventions and prevention efforts to reduce depression among residents in Wuhan, in the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Li, Zhang, Yang, Sha, Cheung, Jackson, Zang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.735973","20211018","COVID-19; Wuhan; depression; mental health; network analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19026,""
"Risk of PTSD Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Patients in Opioid Substitution Treatment","<b>Background:</b> The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of patients suffering from addictive disorders is of major concern. This study aimed to explore the presence and potential increase in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and anxiety since the beginning of the pandemic for patients in opioid substitution therapy (OST). <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional survey study evaluated a clinical sample of patients in OST (<i>N</i> = 123). Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed by an adapted version of the impact of event scale (IES-R), resulting in two subgroups of low and high risk for PTSD. The depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) was applied to collect data on the respective symptoms, and changes since the onset of the pandemic were reported on separate scales. Sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors, as well as data on craving, consumption patterns, concomitant use, and the drug market were further assessed. <b>Results:</b> A binary logistic regression analysis confirmed the impact of self-perceived higher burden by psychological and economic factors on the elevated risk for PTSD due to the pandemic. The high-risk PTSD group also showed higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as a more pronounced deterioration in these symptoms since the pandemic. While reported levels of craving did not differ between the two groups, the high-risk PTSD group indicated a significantly higher increase in craving since the crisis, when compared to the low-risk group. <b>Discussion:</b> Our findings demonstrate elevated levels of clinical symptoms among patients in OST, with more than a quarter of patients found at risk for PTSD due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, about 30-50% of our patients reported concerning levels of depression, anxiety, or stress. Special attention should be drawn to these findings, and potential deterioration of the situation should be addressed by health care facilities. Particularly, psychological, and financial burden due to the crisis were identified as factors increasing the risk for PTSD. These factors can easily be evaluated during routine anamneses, and might be a valuable source of information, when special attention is needed.","Fuchs-Leitner, Yazdi, Gerstgrasser, Tholen, Graffius, Schorb, Rosenleitner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.729460","20211018","COVID-19; DASS-21; IES-R; PTSD; drug use disorder; opioid substitution therapy (OST)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19027,""
"Developmental Understanding of Death and Grief Among Children During COVID-19 Pandemic: Application of Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Model","COVID-19 Pandemic has influenced death-related attitudes and understanding during the childhood development leading to a life-long impact. Factors like pandemic-related movement restrictions, school closures, and parents' stay-at-home have exposed children to the phenomenon of grief and death. In that case, children anticipate adverse outcomes and fear while they struggle with unanswered questions. Children may not have coping skills needed to manage their grief in constructive ways to identify, normalize, and express their responses to the loss in their lives. Naming and validating these responses as distinctive aspects of grief process and providing safe space to express their feelings are essential components of a child's coping with loss and grief. This is crucial to consider, as different children react to and are influenced by their environments differently. This article aims to explore the developmental understanding of the process of death and grief by applying the conceptual framework of Bronfenbrenner's theory. Understanding mutual interaction between a child and various ecological systems determines how children perceive death and process grief can facilitate effective communication that has significant implications.","Chachar, Younus, Ali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.654584","20211018","Bronfenbrenner's ecological model; COVID-19 pandemic; child and adolescent mental health; death anxiety; developmental perspective","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19028,""
"Risk of First-Episode Schizophrenia in Aged Adults Increased During COVID-19 Outbreak","We noticed an unusual increase of aged adults in first-episode schizophrenia in January and February 2020 since the outbreak of COVID-19. This retrospective study aims to statistically validate this observation and find potential risk factors, if applicable. The demographics of schizophrenia in outpatients (both first-episode and follow-up) from January to March 2020 (36,624 records) and similar periods of 2017-2019 (114,141 records) were analyzed and compared to minimize seasonal influence. Limited personal information (age, gender, approximate residence) was investigated to find risk factors. After considering seasonal factors such as the Spring festival, the age of the first-episode schizophrenia was significantly increased in January (46.60Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.14) and February (51.53Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.74) but went back to normal in March 2020 (38.89Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.59), compared with similar periods from 2017 to 2019 (Jan., 40.77Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.26; Feb., 39.69Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.10; Mar., 42.04Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.83). Meanwhile, a slight but not significant change was found in the distribution of gender and approximate residence (urban/suburb). Our data supported that risk of first-episode schizophrenia in aged adults increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, which is consistent with the fact that COVID-19 is more lethal to elders.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Anxiety of Adolescents in QuÃƒÂ©bec","Several studies conducted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic have shown its harmful effects on young people's mental health. In QuÃƒÂ©bec and Canada, few studies have focussed on adolescents, and even fewer of these studies have examined this subject using a methodology that involved comparisons of data obtained before and during the pandemic, which is the purpose of this study. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety of secondary 1 and 2 students in QuÃƒÂ©bec, using data obtained before and during the pandemic. Participants were 2990 French Canadian students in secondary 1 (grade 7) and secondary 2 (grade 8) in QuÃƒÂ©bec. Two independent samples completed the questionnaires, one sample before the pandemic (fall 2019) and one sample during the pandemic (fall 2020). Their answers were subjected to descriptive analysis and multivariate analysis of variance. Results show that the pandemic has had variable impacts on the student's mental health, with some of them reporting negative effects on their lives, others reporting no effect, and some reporting positive effect. However, the students surveyed during the pandemic generally reported more symptoms of generalized anxiety, and higher levels of test anxiety, fear of judgment and perfectionism than the ones surveyed before the pandemic. The discussion puts forward possible explanations for the results obtained, which contribute to a better understanding of young adolescents' experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also discusses the importance of developing interventions for adolescents affected by this pandemic.","Lane, Therriault, Dupuis, Gosselin, Smith, Ziam, Roy, Roberge, Drapeau, Morin, Berrigan, Thibault, Dufour","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10566-021-09655-9","20211018","Adolescence; Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19030,""

"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on university students' anxiety disorder in Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of specific population sections, with regards to economic and work conditions, mental and physical well-being, and context-based factors, emphasizing the need for timely policy measures aimed at counteracting the Italian economic framework's fragility-which poorly adapts to unexpected circumstances. Identifying the most vulnerable groups is, therefore, essential with a view to carrying out targeted measures. Concerning University, the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 could likely result in a decrease in enrollments to both the first and further years of study, with significant consequences on the future of students and the system as a whole. The class of students is of great interest, as it is made up of individuals differing from each other in many ways.

"Sources of psychological distress among primary care physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave in Spain: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people worldwide. In Spain, the first wave was especially severe. This study aimed to identify sources and levels of distress among Spanish primary care physicians (PCPs) during the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020). A cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey that included sociodemographic data, a description of working conditions related to distress [such as gaps in training in protective measures, cleaning, and hygiene procedures in work setting, unavailability of personal protective equipments (PPEs) and COVID-19 RT-PCR test, and lack of staff due to be infected] and a validated scale, the 'Self-applied Acute Stress Scale' (EASE). The survey was answered by a non-probability sampling of PCPs working in family healthcare centres from different regions of Spain. Analysis of variance and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed. In all, out of 518 PCP participants, 123 (23.7%) obtained high psychological distress scores. Only half of them had received information about the appropriate use of PPE. PCP characteristics associated with higher levels of distress include female gender [1.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54, 2.84]; lack of training in protective measures (1.96; 95% CI 0.94, 2.99); unavailable COVID-19 RT-PCR for health care workers after quarantine or COVID-19 treatment (-0.77 (-1.52, -0.02). Reinforcing disinfection of the work environment (P &lt; 0.05), availability of PPEs (P &lt; 0.05), and no healthcare professional was infected (P &lt; 0.05) were related to the lowest distress score.

"Post-traumatic stress symptoms during the first and second COVID-19 lockdown in Greece: Rates, risk, and protective factors","The aim was to (i) compare the rates of perceived stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and other potential correlates (i.e., resilience, social support, coping strategies, and loneliness) in the general population between the two COVID-19 lockdowns in Greece and (ii) explore risk and protective factors of PTSS. Online data were collected amid the first (timepoint 1-T1) and second lockdownÃ‚Â (timepoint 2-T2) by 1009 and 352 participants, respectively. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and the Perceived Stress Scale measured levels of PTSS and perceived stress. The Brief Resilience Scale, the COPE, the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, and the ENRICHD Social Support Instrument measured resilience, coping strategies, loneliness, and social support, respectively.Ã‚Â Higher levels of PTSS and perceived stress were reported during T2, compared to T1. Clinically significant levels of PTSS were presented by 26.1% and 35.5% of the participants during T1 and T2, respectively. Higher levels of loneliness and use of maladaptive coping strategies and lower levels of social support, resilience and use of adaptive coping strategies were also found. During both lockdowns, PTSS were predicted by perceived stress, loneliness, reduced resilience and the coping strategies of denial and self-blame. PTSS were associated with younger age, female gender, being single, not having children, and the evaluation of the pandemic as a crisis. The findings highlight the significant public mental health concerns during the COVID-19 lockdowns.

"Survey of COVID-19 impact on pediatric urology services","To better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has forced rapid operational changes in the global healthcare industry, changes implemented on an individual, institutional basis must be considered. There currently is not adequate literature about the overall impact COVID-19 has had on pediatric urology services worldwide. We believe that they have dramatically decreased during the COVID-19 crisis, but have adapted to accommodate changes. We hypothesize that patient care was widely variant due to inadequate standardized recommendations or crisis planning. A web-based survey was deployed to 377 pediatric urologists globally via email to analyze COVID-19's impact on various types of pediatric urology practices. Key categories included impacts on elective services, telemedicine use, finances, and recovery operations. A total of 114 responses were collected between April 29th - May 22nd, 2020. The widespread cancellation of elective surgical procedures caused significant disturbances in the field. There was a uniform, significant increase (75%) in telemedicine use across practices. The pandemic has created many changes in care provision for physicians, institutions, and patients themselves. Furthermore, the sudden economic burden on healthcare facilities could lead to cost-cutting measures, creating further strain within institutions. Though telemedicine has its limitations, it is a very viable option when traditional services are unavailable. Immediate steps should be taken to ensure that the recovery phases of pediatric urology practices are as efficient as possible. Institutions should develop task forces to develop critical workflow processes in the event of health crises, while still maintaining patient-centered care. This will be essential in maximizing appropriate care allocation.","Mallenahalli, Fifolt, Gundeti, Lakshmanan, Gargollo, Ost, Dangle","https://www.google.com/search?q=Survey+of+COVID-19+impact+on+pediatric+urology+services.","20211018","COVID-19; financial impact; pediatric urology; survey; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19038,""
"Comparing the impact of the first and second wave of COVID-19 lockdown on Slovak families with typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder","A global pandemic caused by a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) affected everyday lives of all people, including individuals with special needs, such as autism spectrum disorder. The aim of this research was to compare the mental health of families with children with autism spectrum disorder to families with typically developing children, and between the first and the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Slovakia. This mainly included symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress of parents and problem behavior or sleeping difficulties of their children. The research sample consisted of 332 parents (155 of which have children with autism spectrum disorder), 179 surveyed during the first wave and 153 during the second wave. Online parent questionnaire was created, including demographic and specific topic questions, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-42 questionnaire, and internalizing and externalizing maladaptive behavior subscales from Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Our results show that during the first wave, parents of autism spectrum disorder children suffered high levels of anxiety. During the second wave, both groups of parents suffered increased anxiety, stress, and depression, but especially severe for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Internalizing maladaptive behavior of autistic children grew significantly between the waves. Parental depression, anxiety, and stress were interconnected with maladaptive behavior of both autism spectrum disorder and typically developing children, suggesting the importance of the therapy options for whole families.","PolÃƒÂ³nyiovÃƒÂ¡, Belica, CeluÃ…Â¡ÃƒÂ¡kovÃƒÂ¡, JanÃ…Â¡ÃƒÂ¡kovÃƒÂ¡, KopÃ„ÂÃƒÂ­kovÃƒÂ¡, SzapuovÃƒÂ¡, OstatnÃƒÂ­kovÃƒÂ¡","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211051480","20211018","COVID-19; anxiety; autism spectrum disorder; lockdown; mental health; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19039,""
"Combining Virtual Reality and Behavioral Health to Promote Pain Resiliency: Analysis of a Novel BioPsychoSocial Modality for Solving Pain in the Workplace","The use of virtual reality in treating pain symptoms is a new and emerging modality that has gained more traction, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a rise in the remote care of patients. Our study tested the effectiveness of a home-based pain relief program that utilized virtual reality and behavioral health for treating acute and chronic pain. Retrospective Cohort Study. Due to the remote nature of the pain clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with work-related injuries were considered for inclusion in a 90-day Harvard MedTech Vx Pain Relief Program, which consisted of home-based virtual reality therapy (VRT) and tailored behavioral therapy that was conducted through phone consultations. Both the VRT and behavioral therapy focused on the specific workplace injury and centered around setting three personal goals for each patient that were considered meaningful to them. The progress towards achieving these goals was then tracked. The primary outcome of the retrospective analysis was pain scores after completion of home-based VRT. Secondary outcomes included: change in opioid therapy (opioid consumption), psychological awareness/perception of pain, level of immersion, and overall improvement/achievement in patient goals. A total of 36 patients (16 male and 20 female) with acute and chronic pain secondary to workplace injuries were included; these injuries severely limited their activities of daily living and reduced their quality of life. During the course of VRT and after completion of the 90-day program, patients experienced a substantial immediate and legacy pain relief. Specifically, patients reported an average 40% reduction in pain while utilizing the program and an additional 2.8Ã‚Â h of continued pain relief at the conclusion of 90Ã‚Â days. Further, 69% of patients also reported either a decrease in opioid use or complete cessation after VRT. The majority of patients also reported reduced depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. The Harvard MedTech Vx Therapy appears to be an effective tool in the treatment of pain and the psycho-social issues associated with pain. This translates into a greater degree of pain resiliency and an overall improvement in general wellness and improved workplace functionality.","Abd-Elsayed, Hussain, Stanley","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-021-00333-1","20211017","Chronic pain; Pain psychology; Virtual reality; Workers compensation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19040,""

Orv Hetil. 22021; 162(42): 1671-1677. Summary. Several patients with COVID-19 infection report prolonged complaints after recovery and many of them suffer from persistent cough, dyspnea, chest pain and shortness of breath regardless of whether the coronavirus caused mild or more severe symptoms. They complain of severe fatigue and weakness while others grizzle about gastrointestinal complaints, headache, depression, loss of sense of smell and taste. Numerous studies describe that the infection can affect lung function even in months and coronavirus infection can be detectable in previously healthy lungs by taking a control chest CT scan three months after recovery. Therefore, chest follow-up is required after the infection if the patient has prolonged complaints or if the disease has caused pneumonia. In addition to the currently operating inpatient respiratory rehabilitation, there is also a need for an outpatient extension of treatment to achieve complete recovery in patients without further hospitalization. For those patients who have had the COVID-19 infection complex rehabilitation can improve their workload, quality of life, improves their respiratory function values, reduces their complaints and also improves their physical and mental condition. The aim of our summary research is to review what COVID-19 outpatient rehabilitation programs have been initiated for patients who went through coronavirus infection on international and domestic scenes.

"Safety and efficacy of aviandr in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, pilot study","Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with an imbalance in the functioning of the stimulating neurotransmitter systems in human's brain. We studied the safety and therapeutic efficacy of aviandr, the new noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, for GAD patients in the phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, pilot trial at 17 clinical sites of the Russian Federation. 129 eligible patients were 18 years and older and met the criteria for GAD diagnosis. The patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral aviandr at daily dose of 40Ã‚Â mg (cohort 1, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 41) or 60Ã‚Â mg (cohort 2, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 43) or placebo (cohort 3, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 43) for 8 weeks. The patients were assessed by the Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-S), Visual Analogue Scale and vital signs. At week 8, the decreases of the HAM-A score were achieved in 53Ã¢Ë†â„¢7%, 47Ã¢Ë†â„¢7% and 16Ã¢Ë†â„¢3% in cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Changes of HAM-A, HAM-D, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores in aviandr-treated patients were superior to placebo (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0Ã¢Ë†â„¢001). The psychic components of anxiety decreased on the first day, throughout the 8 weeks of treatment and on a follow-up week after aviandr discontinuation. Aviandr (40Ã‚Â mg daily dose) reduced drowsiness compared to baseline, was safe, well-tolerated and did not cause serious or severe adverse events or signs of withdrawal syndrome within one week after treatment completion. Aviandr at both 40 and 60Ã‚Â mg daily doses demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in GAD patients over placebo.","Ivashchenko, Morozova, Vostokova, Beniashvily, Bukhanovskaya, Burminskiy, Egorova, Gluskina, Gorchakov, Karapetian, Kasimova, Kravchenko, Lepilkina, Merkulova, Mitkin, Penchul, Potanin, Rupchev, Ivachtchenko","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.10.008","20211017","Aviandr; COVID-19; Generalized anxiety disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19042,""

"The impact of emotion regulation and mental health difficulties on health behaviours during COVID19","The COVID-19 outbreak is having a profound impact on individuals' psychological and physical wellbeing. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of this impact and its mechanisms on a sample of adults living in Italy during the first lockdown (April-May 2020). Two hundred ninety-two individuals (67.1% females) were recruited from the community through social media. They completed baseline online questionnaires to collect demographic information, data on past and present general health and health behaviours, and to assess emotion regulation strategies. Participants completed a brief survey to assess mood and health behaviours three times a week, for three weeks. Individuals with lifetime psychiatric disorders (about 50%) reported greater negative mood and use of unhealthy behaviours over time, compared to those with no psychiatric vulnerability. The use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions was associated with greater resilience (i.e., feelings of hope and resourcefulness, and ability to seek social support and enjoyable activities). Cognitive reappraisal is a skill that can be trained and could be utilised to buffer the effect of general stress (i.e. stress caused by the pandemic) on individuals' wellbeing.","Cardi, Albano, Gentili, Sudulich","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.10.001","20211016","COVID-19; Emotion regulation; Health; Psychology; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19044,""

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment-seeking veterans in the united kingdom with preexisting mental health difficulties: A longitudinal study","Individuals with preexisting psychological difficulties are at risk of further deterioration of their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. This longitudinal study, conducted during the period between two national lockdowns, aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on veterans in the United Kingdom with preexisting mental health difficulties. Treatment-seeking veterans with preexisting mental health difficulties (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 95) were surveyed in two waves. Wave 1 was conducted at the end of the first lockdown (June 2020-July 2020), and Wave 2 took place during the second lockdown (November 2020). Participants completed measures to assess symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); common mental health difficulties (CMDs), including anxiety and depression; anger; and alcohol use. Initial analyses revealed no significant changes in symptoms of PTSD, CMDs, anger, or alcohol use between the lockdowns, psÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .247-.986. However, veterans who experienced more COVID-19-related stressors were more likely to experience increases in PTSD, odds ratio (OR)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.30, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .002, and CMD symptoms, ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.32, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .025. Participants with lower levels of social support during the second lockdown were more likely to experience increased anger difficulties, ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.91, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .025. The findings suggest that although mental health among veterans in the United Kingdom may have remained relatively stable between the two lockdowns, those who reported more COVID-related stressors and lower levels of social support may have been particularly vulnerable to symptom exacerbation.

"Identification of Workers at Increased Risk of Infection During a COVID-19 Outbreak in a Meat Processing Plant, France, May 2020","On 13 May 2020, a COVID-19 cluster was detected in a French processing plant. Infected workers were described. The associations between the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the socio-demographic and occupational characteristics were assessed in order to implement risk management measures targeting workers at increased risk of contamination. Workers were tested by RT-PCR from samples taken during screening campaigns. Workers who tested positive were isolated and their contacts were quarantined. Workers were described and associations with the SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed through risk ratios using multivariable Poisson regression. Of the 1347 workers, 87.5% were tested: 140 cases were identified; 4 were hospitalised, including 2 admitted to intensive care. In the company, the cluster remained limited to deboning and cutting activities. The attack rate was 11.9% in the company, reaching 16.6% in the cutting department. Being an employee of a subcontractor significantly increased the risk of infection by 2.98 [1.81-4.99]. In the cutting department, an association with virus infection was found for a group of non-French speaking workers from the same Eastern European country (RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.67 [1.76-4.05]). They shared accommodation or carpooled more frequently than the other cases. The outbreak investigation revealed a significantly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for workers of subcontractors and some foreign-born workers. There are many such populations in meat processing plants; the observed associations and the ways in which these workers are contaminated need to be confirmed by further work. Prevention campaigns should now target these workers.

"Cannabis/Cannabinoids for Treating COVID-19 Associated Neuropsychiatric Complications","COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in devastating mortality and morbidity consisting of socioeconomic and health effects that have included respiratory/pulmonary, cardiovascular, mental health and neurological consequences such as anxiety, depression, and substance use. Several effective vaccines have been developed and extensive efforts are underway to develop therapeutics to treat COVID-19. Cannabis and/or its product-cannabidiol (CBD) are being advertised for the treatment of COVID-19 associated mental/neurological complications and substance use disorders. However, research reviewed shows that there is insufficient data from clinical studies to support the use of cannabis or CBD for the treatment of COVID-19 associated mental health and neurological complications. Additional basic and clinical research is suggested to develop cannabis or cannabidiol for the treatment of mental health problems associated with coronavirus infection and or substance use disorders. In the meantime, it is important that the addiction physician/psychiatrist must caution while prescribing or recommending cannabis or CBD for treating such clinical indications. Research shows that currently there is no clinical evidence to support the use of cannabis or any of its compounds including CBD for treating any of the neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19. Thus, it is important that the addiction physicians/psychiatrists caution their patients from using cannabis or cannabis products for treating any such complications.","Khalsa, Maggirwar, Bunt","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11481-021-10013-8","20211016","CBD; COVID-19; Cannabidiol; Cannabis; Neuropsychiatric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19048,""

"School Connectedness Still Matters: The Association of School Connectedness and Mental Health During Remote Learning Due to COVID-19","School connectedness is consistently associated with adolescent mental health and well-being. We investigated whether student perceptions of school connectedness were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, even during remote learning due to COVID-19. In June of 2020, after 13Ã‚Â weeks of remote learning, 320 middle and high school students in one Massachusetts school district completed an online survey that included questions about their perceptions of school connectedness, social connectedness, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Students were approximately evenly distributed across grades, with 37% in middle school (grades 6-8) and 63% in high school (grades 9-12). School connectedness had a significant negative association with symptoms of anxiety and depression. This association persisted in models controlling for demographic factors and social connectedness. Findings indicate that school connectedness is associated with student mental health, even in the context of remote learning due to COVID-19. Schools engaged in remote learning should consider how to foster school connectedness as a means of supporting youth mental health, particularly given expected increases in the mental health needs of adolescents.","Perkins, Carey, Lincoln, Shih, Donalds, Kessel Schneider, Holt, Green","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10935-021-00649-w","20211016","Adolescence; COVID-19; Mental health; School connectedness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19050,""
"Back pain occurred due to changes in routinary activities among Brazilian schoolteachers during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study's main objective was to investigate the emergence of back pain as a consequence to changes in usual activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic among teachers in public schools in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 15,276 schoolteachers using an online questionnaire. The variables included sociodemographic and occupational data, health situation, habits and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bivariate analyses using Pearson's chi-square test and multiple analyses using Poisson regression were performed to identify the associated factors. About 58% of schoolteachers reported back pain due to changes in routine activities during the pandemic. The adjusted model showed a correlation between back pain and female sex, longer working hours, overwork, difficulties concerning distance working, negative changes in health status and quality of sleep; frequent feeling of sadness, depression, or anxiety; use of medications to relax, sleep or against stress/anxiety/depression; physical inactivity or negative changes in the practice of physical activities; increased body weight; reduction of leisure time; increased time of use of computer or tablet and overload of housework. During the COVID-19 pandemic, schoolteachers reported a high prevalence of emergence of back pain, which delineates a contradiction in terms: on the one hand, distance education allows social distancing that contributes to the preservation of teachers' health by reducing the risk of contamination by COVID-19. On the other hand, it imposes new demands that-in disagreement with working conditions-can threaten the health of these workers.","Barbosa, Fonseca, Souza E Silva, Silva, AssunÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o, Haikal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01793-w","20211016","Back pain; Brazil; COVID-19; Musculoskeletal disorders; Schoolteachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19051,""
"Cutting Edge: Circulating Exosomes with COVID Spike Protein Are Induced by BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) Vaccination prior to Development of Antibodies: A Novel Mechanism for Immune Activation by mRNA Vaccines","Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. mRNA vaccines directed at the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein resulted in development of Abs and protective immunity. To determine the mechanism, we analyzed the kinetics of induction of circulating exosomes with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Ab following vaccination of healthy individuals. Results demonstrated induction of circulating exosomes expressing spike protein on day 14 after vaccination followed by Abs 14 d after the second dose. Exosomes with spike protein, Abs to SARS-CoV-2 spike, and T cells secreting IFN-ÃŽÂ³ and TNF-ÃŽÂ± increased following the booster dose. Transmission electron microscopy of exosomes also demonstrated spike protein Ags on their surface. Exosomes with spike protein and Abs decreased in parallel after four months. These results demonstrate an important role of circulating exosomes with spike protein for effective immunization following mRNA-based vaccination. This is further documented by induction of humoral and cellular immune responses in mice immunized with exosomes carrying spike protein.","Bansal, Perincheri, Fleming, Poulson, Tiffany, Bremner, Mohanakumar","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100637","20211016","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19052,""
"Suicidal behavior sociocultural factors in developing countries during COVID-19","Sociocultural factors in the aftermath of any pandemic can play a role in increasing suicidal behavior like suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, or suicide. The authors discuss the risk and predisposing factors for suicidal ideation among mental health patients in four developing countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India and Pakistan), this aims to grasp the heterogeneity of these motivators and to elaborate specific interventions regarding suicide in the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar through March, 2021 for articles using a combination of the keywords and generic terms for suicide, suicide ideation, COVID-19, developing countries, low-middle-income countries, Sociocultural factors, Suicidal behavior, predisposing factors and predictive factors, for articles in English language only, and without publication time restriction. This narrative review summarizes the sociocultural risk and predisposing factors for suicidal behavior in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings reveal those factors such as fear of being infected, growing economic pressure, lack of resources due to lockdown are mostly responsible in the four countries for the current increase in suicides. There are a few cultural differences that are specified in the narrative. The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health challenge, in which prevention and intervention of suicidal behavior have been suboptimal, especially in low-middle-income countries. Based on literature results, we provide practical suggestions (e.g., reducing infodemic, specialized helplines, improving mental health services availability) in order to tackle main challenges of suicide prevention, such as lack of adequate manpower, fragile health system and poverty.","Shoib, GaitÃƒÂ¡n Buitrago, Shuja, Aqeel, de Filippis, Abbas, Ullah, Arafat","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2021.06.011","20211016","COVID-19; Developing countries; Low-middle-income countries (LMIC); Sociocultural factors; Suicidal behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19053,""
"Systematic Review: Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health Outcomes of Individuals With ADHD","According to the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on the mental health of individuals, such as an exacerbation of existing difficulties. Individuals with ADHD may be specifically challenged by the pandemic. To provide a systematic review of evidence regarding the COVID-19's impact on mental health of individuals with ADHD during the COVID-19 lockdown. This registered review (PROSPERO ID CRD42021238770) adhered to Prisma guidelines. Systematic searches in electronic databases PubMed and PsycINFO were carried out. A total of 12 studies covering 3,028 subjects were included. COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased ADHD symptoms and psychological difficulties. Some studies reported that individuals experienced positive outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was low to moderate. COVID-19 can affect the mental health of individuals with ADHD negatively, although methodological limitations should be considered. Further research should generate knowledge about long-term effects impact of the pandemic and about appropriate support.","Behrmann, Blaabjerg, Jordansen, Jensen de LÃƒÂ³pez","https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547211050945","20211016","ADHD; COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","",19054,""
