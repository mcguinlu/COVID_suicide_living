"In-person vs home schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences in sleep, circadian timing, and mood in early adolescence","During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools around the world rapidly transitioned from in-person to remote learning, providing an opportunity to examine the impact of in-person vs. remote learning on sleep, circadian timing, and mood. We assessed sleep-wake timing using wrist-actigraphy and sleep diaries over 1-2 weeks during in-person learning (n=28) and remote learning (n=58, where n=27 were repeat assessments) in adolescents (age MÃ‚Â±SD =12.79Ã‚Â±0.42 years). Circadian timing was measured under a single condition in each individual using salivary melatonin (Dim Light Melatonin Onset; DLMO). Online surveys assessed mood (PROMIS Pediatric Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms) and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale - Child and Adolescent) in each condition. During remote (vs. in-person) learning: (i) on school days, students went to sleep 26 min later and woke 49 min later, resulting in 22 min longer sleep duration (all p&lt;0.0001); (ii) DLMO time did not differ significantly between conditions, although participants woke at a later circadian phase (43 minutes, p=0.03) during remote learning; and (iii) participants reported significantly lower sleepiness (p=0.048) and lower anxiety symptoms (p=0.006). Depressive symptoms did not differ between conditions. Changes in mood symptoms were not mediated by sleep. Although remote learning continued to have fixed school start times, removing morning commutes likely enabled adolescents to sleep longer, wake later, and to wake at a later circadian phase. These results indicate that remote learning, or later school start times, may extend sleep and improve some subjective symptoms in adolescents.","Stone, Phillips, Chachos, Hand, Lu, Carskadon, Klerman, Lockley, Wiley, Bei, Rajaratnam","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpi.12757","20210717","COVID-19; adolescence; circadian rhythms; melatonin; remote learning; school start times; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","",16042,""
"Mitigating the Impact of Reemergence From a Pandemic on Healthcare","Healthcare workers have never faced a medical crisis that compares to the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. This modern-day pandemic fight draws parallels to a war. Because of these similarities, it would make sense that the experiences frontline providers have when transitioning to a normal healthcare routine would emulate experiences service members voice when reintegrating home from a battlefield. These common experiences include a unified mission, an exhausting, adrenaline-packed responsibility, and a celebrity-like status to the public. The pandemic response consumed healthcare with one united mission, but as we reemerge from the pandemic and restore other aspects of our healthcare system, multiple missions develop and compete. Returning to a common routine and regular status can manifest feelings of disappointment in healthcare workers' everyday lives and career choices and lead to a reexamination of priorities and professions. As an organization with a focus on high reliability, mitigating the harm to staff and delivery system may be our new priority. The risk of not facing this situation head on is a potential exodus of seasoned professionals contemplating their future and selecting other career paths, thus draining the current institutional knowledge and potentially deterring future generations from healthcare. Leaders in the healthcare industry need to take a proactive stance in addressing this reemergence. Integrated, proactive programming is needed utilizing evidence-based resiliency training from professional organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as well as the existing Department of Defense programs. The Veterans Affairs has the backbone to develop and offer these programs and make a positive difference with Employee Whole Health efforts. Organized, evidence-based programming such as second victim education, mindfulness, and other personal skill building could be key to improving the lifelong well-being of our caregivers.","Hall","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab265","20210717","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","",16043,""
"Covid-19 and the next outbreak: decreasing frailty by using mild stress?","The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has resulted in many deaths, particularly of very old or obese people. These people are at risk to die in the event of an outbreak, like under one-year old babies were at risk to die one century ago from various diseases. It is argued that mild stress could help people to resist new outbreaks. The people who are obese because of bad feeding habits (snacking, junk food, overfeeding) and inactivity should adopt more healthy behaviours. Because an inactive way of life at old age can increase frailty, physical and mental activities should be kept at the highest possible level in elderly people, particularly if they live in retirement homes. In the event of an outbreak, management staff of these homes should not confine residents in their room for weeks or months, as it can increase inactivity, under-nutrition, sarcopenia, and depressive symptoms. People with or without co-morbidities should be active and one could wonder whether other mild stresses such as sauna bathing could help to better resist infection.","Le Bourg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10522-021-09930-1","20210717","Covid-19; Elderly people; Future outbreaks; Mild stress; Obesity; Physical activity; Sauna bathing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","",16044,""
"Understanding Vulnerability to Late-Life Suicide","We review recent evidence on suicide among older adults, examine risk factors contributing to vulnerability to late-life suicide, and summarize possible interventions. We found a steadily increasing rate of late-life suicide in the USA in the past decade. Evidence supporting the integration of depression care managers into primary care for risk reduction is among the strongest to date. Pharmacologic and neuromodulation studies should be considered in geriatric depression complicated by suicidality. Broad societal campaigns about suicide education, as well as active outreach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevent suicidal behavior. Growing research supports an integrative multidisciplinary approach. Suicide is a complex and multifaceted behavior with numerous casual points for intervention. Access to deadly means, presence of depression, disease, disability, and social disconnection are factors that increase vulnerability. Quality geriatric care, regular screening in primary and emergency care settings, and a multidisciplinary approach are necessary to mitigate risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic amplifies need for a more aggressive approach.","Ding, Kennedy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01268-2","20210717","Geriatric; Suicidal ideation; Suicide and self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","",16045,""

"Associations between dimensions of behaviour, personality traits, and mental-health during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom","The COVID-19 pandemic (including lockdown) is likely to have had profound but diverse implications for mental health and well-being, yet little is known about individual experiences of the pandemic (positive and negative) and how this relates to mental health and well-being, as well as other important contextual variables. Here, we analyse data sampled in a large-scale manner from 379,875 people in the United Kingdom (UK) during 2020 to identify population variables associated with mood and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate self-perceived pandemic impact in relation to those variables. We report that while there are relatively small population-level differences in mood assessment scores pre- to peak-UK lockdown, the size of the differences is larger for people from specific groups, e.g. older adults and people with lower incomes. Multiple dimensions underlie peoples' perceptions, both positive and negative, of the pandemic's impact on daily life. These dimensions explain variance in mental health and can be statistically predicted from age, demographics, home and work circumstances, pre-existing conditions, maladaptive technology use and personality traits (e.g., compulsivity). We conclude that a holistic view, incorporating the broad range of relevant population factors, can better characterise people whose mental health is most at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hampshire, Hellyer, Soreq, Mehta, Ioannidis, Trender, Grant, Chamberlain","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24365-5","20210717","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","",16047,""
"Coronavirus, macroeconomy, and forests: What likely impacts?","Much uncertainty persists about how the coronavirus (COVID-19) and its derived crisis effects will impact both the economy and forests. Here we conceptualize a recursive model where an initial COVID-19 supply-side shock hits first the Global North that, mediated by country-specific epidemic management strategies and other (fiscal, monetary, trade) policy responses feeds through to financial markets and the real economy. Analytically we distinguish two stylized scenarios: an optimistic V-shaped recovery where effective policy responses render most economic damages transitory, versus a pessimistic pathway of economic depression, where short-run pandemic impacts are dwarfed by the subsequent economic breakdown. Economic impacts are transitioned from the global North to the South through trade, tourism, remittances and investment/capital flows. As for impacts on tropical forests, we compare the effects of past economic crises to early indicators for incipient trends. We find national income and commodity price effects to be torn between three forces: a contractive-inflationary supply-side shock, deflationary pandemic demand-side effects, and expansive-inflationary monetary and fiscal policy responses. We discuss how global forest outcomes will depend on how these macroeconomic battles are resolved, but also on geographical differences in deforestation dynamics. Reviewing recent fire and deforestation alerts data, as well as annual tree-cover loss data, we find that deforestation-curbing and -enhancing factors so far just about neutralized each other. Yet, country impacts vary greatly. Changing macroeconomic scenarios, such as fading out of huge economic stimulus packages, could change the picture significantly, in line with what our model predicts.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102536","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","",16048,""
"Roles of social media and counselling support in reducing anxiety among Malaysian during Covid-19 pandemic","Covid-19 pandemic has created crises among some Malaysians. The crises have both opportunity and threat impacts. Without proper intervention, some people will develop stress, anxiety, and depression. This study aims to explore the emotional anxiety that exists in the society due to Covid-19 pandemic and the roles of social media and counselling support in reducing anxiety among Malaysians. This quantitative research involved online survey throughout the country. The online survey is administered during the First Phase and the Second Phase of Movement Control Order (MCO). The survey contains 13 items which cover three domain: i) anxiety, ii) roles of social media, and iii) roles of counselling support in reducing anxiety among members of the society. There were 8375 respondents from various age groups, locations, as well as economic and educational statuses involved in the study. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential analysis. Majority of 7233 (86.6%) respondents felt anxious due to Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 7871 respondents (94%) followed the latest updates on Covid-19 to reduce their anxiety. They used social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to gather information and follow the updates through television and press conference. A total of 5251 respondents (62.7%) were aware of the counselling support provided during the MCO, and 4603 respondents (55%) felt comfortable to have counselling support by phone. The findings will contribute to knowledge on the society's emotional anxiety in facing Covid-19. It reflects the actual situation happened in Malaysia during Covid-19 and MCO.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102456","20210901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","",16049,""
