"Impacts of Neonatal Hospitalization on Families during the 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Limited data are available regarding family and financial well-being among parents whose infants were hospitalized during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The study objective was to evaluate the family and financial well-being of parents whose infants were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during COVID-19. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Parents were recruited for this online, cross-sectional survey via support groups on social media. Data collection was completed between May 18, 2020 and July 31, 2020. The final sample consisted of 178 parents, who had an infant hospitalized in an NICU between February 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020. The primary outcomes were impact on family life and financial stability, as measured by the Impact on Family scale, an instrument that evaluates changes to family life as a result of infant or childhood illness. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Of the 178 parent respondents, 173 (97%) were mothers, 107 (59.4%) were non-Hispanic White, and 127 (69.5%) of the infants were born prematurely. Parents reported significant family impact and greater financial difficulty. Extremely premature infants, lower household income, parent mental health, and lower parental confidence were predictive of greater impacts on family life. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Parents reported significant family and financial impacts during their infant's hospitalization amid COVID-19. Further studies are needed to guide clinical practice and inform family-supportive resources that can mitigate consequences to family well-being. Ã‚Â· Impact of infant hospitalization in the context of COVID-19 is largely unknown.. Ã‚Â· In a cohort of NICU parents during COVID-19, they reported changes to family life and finances..

"Association between family caregivers and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults in Japan: A cross-sectional study during the COVID-19 pandemic","Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic could increase the mental health burden of family caregivers of older adults, but related reports are limited. We examined the association between family caregiving and changes in the depressive symptom status during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 957 (mean age [standard deviation]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 80.8 [4.8] years; 53.5% females) community-dwelling older adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years from a semi-urban area of Japan, who completed a mailed questionnaire. Based on the depressive symptom status assessed with the Two-Question Screen between March and October 2020, participants were classified into four groups: ""non-depressive symptoms,"" ""incidence of depressive symptoms,"" ""remission from depressive symptoms,"" or ""persistence of depressive symptoms."" Participants were assessed in October 2020 for the family caregiving status, caregiving role, the severity of care recipients' needs, and increased caregiver burden during the pandemic, each with the simple question. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for changes in depressive symptom status. Compared to non-caregivers, family caregivers were associated with the incidence (OR [95% CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.17 [1.55-6.51], pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) and persistence of depressive symptoms (OR [95% CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.39 [1.30-4.38], pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01). Primary caregivers, caregivers for individuals with severe care needs, and caregivers with increased burden during the pandemic had a high risk of depressive symptoms. Family caregivers had a high risk of depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need for a support system for family caregivers.","Noguchi, Hayashi, Kubo, Tomiyama, Ochi, Hayashi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2021.104468","20210705","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Family caregiver; Mental health; Novel coronavirus disease infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15692,""

"Conducting a state-of-the-art mental health survey in a traditional setting: Challenges and lessons from piloting the World Mental Health Survey in Qatar","A small country in the Arabian Peninsula, Qatar experienced rapid economic growth in the last 3Ã‚Â decades accompanied by major socio-demographic shifts towards a younger and more highly educated population. To date, no national epidemiological study has examined the prevalence, associated factors, or sequelae of mental disorders in Qatar's general population. The World Mental Health Qatar (WMHQ) is a national mental health needs assessment survey and is the first carried out in collaboration with the World Mental Health Survey initiative to assess the prevalence and burden of psychiatric illnesses among the full Arabic speaking population (nationals and non-nationals) within the same country. Standard translation and harmonization procedures were used to develop the WMHQ instrument. A survey quality control system with standard performance indicators was developed to ensure interviewer adherence to standard practices. A pilot study was then carried out just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Endorsement from public health authorities and sequential revision of the interview schedule led to full survey completion (as opposed to partial completion) and good overall response rate. The WMHQ survey will provide timely and actionable information based on quality enhancement procedures put in place during the development and piloting of the study.","Khaled, Petcu, Bader, Amro, Al-Assi, Le Trung, Mneimneh, Sampson, Kessler, Woodruff","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1885","20210705","Arab; Qatar; WHO CIDI-5; mental health survey; psychiatric Epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15694,""
"Electrocardiographic Findings and In-Hospital Mortality of COVID-19 Patients; a Retrospective Cohort Study","Although current evidence points to the possible prognostic value of electrocardiographic (ECG) findings for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients, most of these studies have been performed on a small sample size. In this study, our aim was to investigate the ECG changes as prognostic indicators of in-hospital mortality. In a retrospective cohort study, the findings of the first and the second ECGs of COVID-19 patients were extracted and changes in the ECGs were examined. Any abnormal finding in the second ECG that wasn't present in the initial ECG at the time of admission was defined as an ECG change. ECGs were interpreted by a cardiologist and the prognostic value of abnormal ECG findings for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients was evaluated using multivariate analysis and the report of the relative risk (RR). Data of the ECGs recorded at the time of admission were extracted from the files of 893 patients; likewise, the second ECGs could be extracted from the records of 328 patients who had an initial ECG. The presence of sinus tachycardia (RR = 2.342; p &lt;0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.688; p = 0.001), ventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.854; p = 0.011), interventricular conduction delays (RR = 1.608; p = 0.009), and abnormal R wave progression (RR = 1.766; p = 0.001) at the time of admission were independent prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality. In the second ECG, sinus tachycardia (RR = 2.222; p &lt;0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.632; p &lt;0.001), abnormal R wave progression (RR = 2.151; p = 0.009), and abnormal T wave (RR = 1.590; p = 0.001) were also independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, by comparing the first and the second ECGs, it was found that the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.973; p = 0.005) and ST segment elevation/depression (RR = 2.296; p &lt;0.001) during hospitalization (ECG novel changes) are two independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Due to the fact that using electrocardiographic data is easy and accessible and it is easy to continuously monitor patients with this tool, ECGs can be useful in identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients for mortality.","Haji Aghajani, Toloui, Aghamohammadi, Pourhoseingholi, Taherpour, Sistanizad, Madani Neishaboori, Asadpoordezaki, Miri","https://doi.org/10.22037/aaem.v9i1.1250","20210705","COVID-19; Electrocardiography; Hospital mortality; Prognosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15695,""
"Healthcare staff well-being and use of support services during COVID-19: a UK perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically increased demands on healthcare workers (HCWs) leaving them vulnerable to acute psychological distress, burnout and post-traumatic stress. In response, supportive services in a central London hospital mobilised mental health support specifically for HCWs. This rapid evaluation assessed HCW psychological welfare during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and their use of supportive services made available. During the acute phase of COVID-19 (April to May 2020) all staff working for the hospital were invited to complete an online survey assessing well-being (self-rated health, moral distress exposure, symptoms of burnout and psychological distress) and use of available supportive services (awareness of, use and perceived helpfulness). Associations among personal characteristics and psychological well-being were explored using correlations and linear regression. A total of 1127 staff participated in the rapid evaluation. On average, psychological distress was high (mean (SD): 22 (7.57)) regardless of role, with 84% of this sample scoring above the general population mean (14.5). Nearly half of the sample reported feeling emotionally drained and a profile emerged displaying higher levels of psychological distress and burnout in those who were younger and exposed to morally distressing situations, with this group also exhibiting greater support service use. Greater levels of burnout were associated with increased psychological distress when controlling for personal factors. During this acute phase of the pandemic, majority of staff used at least one service and rated it as helpful. HCWs experienced high levels of psychological distress requiring continued support as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved. Although HCWs were aware of supportive services, uptake varied. In order to mitigate the risk of burnout and post-traumatic stress, long-term, effective strategies that facilitate staff accessing support are urgently required.","Petrella, Hughes, Fern, Monaghan, Hannon, Waters, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100458","20210705","COVID-19; healthcare workers; psychological distress; supportive services; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15696,""
"Utilizing social media platforms to promote mental health awareness and help seeking in underserved communities during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 virus has resulted in significant psychological distress for many individuals, particularly, those in underserved communities. Social media have the potential to be one of the most effective tools for mental health campaigns, reaching wide audiences in the shortest amount of time. In this paper, the potential of harnessing social media platforms to address mental health needs in underserved populations is presented. In addition, description of the preliminary implementation of a social media mental health campaign, the 5 Ãƒâ€” 5 campaign, is described as an example of the feasibility and benefits of such efforts. Key implications gleaned from the implementation process are also presented. Utilizing a participatory approach, the 5 Ãƒâ€” 5 campaign aimed to improve recognition of mental health symptoms, promote help seeking, and provide immediate strategies for self-care for individuals experiencing psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income, high-risk communities in and around Guatemala City. Campaign content was promoted on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp from April 2020 to June 2020. Preliminary analysis of the 5 Ãƒâ€” 5 campaign demonstrated feasibility and substantial impact with over 84,000 individuals reached by the campaigns through initial messaging and shares. The 5 Ãƒâ€” 5 highlights the feasibility of using social media campaigns for mental health promotion and key factors that should be incorporated in the planning of social media mental health campaigns aimed at promoting awareness, engaging underserved communities, and encouraging help seeking.","Alonzo, Popescu","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_21_21","20210705","COVID_19; feasibility; implementation; mental health campaigns; social media; underserved communities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15697,""
"Staff SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence and Mental Health as Key Factors in University Response to COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> In response to rapid global spread of the newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), universities transitioned to online learning and telework to decrease risks of inter-person contact. To help administrators respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and better understand its impacts, we surveyed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among NOVA University employees and assessed community mental health. <b>Methods:</b> Data were collected from voluntary participants at six NOVA University locations, in the Lisbon metropolitan area, from June 15-30, 2020. All subjects provided written informed consent. Of 1,627 recruited participants (mean age 42.0 Ã‚Â± 12.3 years), 1,624 were tested. Prior to blood collection, participants completed a questionnaire that assessed: COVID-19 symptoms during the previous 14 days, chronic non-communicable diseases, chronic medication, anxiety, and depression symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 serology tests were then performed, and results communicated approximately 4 days after blood draw. Participants with positive serology tests were contacted to assess COVID-19 symptoms since February. <b>Results:</b> Estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 3.1% (<i>n</i> = 50), of which 43.5% reported symptoms in the previous 4 months. The Medical School had the highest seroprevalence (6.2%). Participants reported having at least one chronic disease (63.7%), depression-like symptoms (2.1%), and anxiety symptoms (8.1%). Rates of depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly higher in women, with sleep hours and occasional alcohol consumption negatively associated with depression. Male gender, older age, and sleep hours negatively associated with anxiety symptoms. School of employment and presence of comorbidities positively associated with anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> By measuring seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among NOVA employees and assessing subjects' mental health, we aim to help administrators at European public universities in urban areas, such as Lisbon, Portugal, better understand the needs of their communities. This study resulted in implementation of a stricter contingency plan in the Medical School, while other schools continued to follow Government mitigation guidelines. These findings may also guide the development of tailored strategies to ensure physical and mental health of the academic community during this pandemic crisis. We conclude that, together with COVID-19 contingency plans, psychological support services and facilities to help people effectively face pandemic-associated challenges and minimise anxiety and depression should be implemented.","Lopes, Henriques, Santos-Dias, Nunes-da-Silva, GonÃƒÂ§alves, de Sousa, Abdulghani, EletÃƒÂ©rio, Braga, Soares, Branco, CanhÃƒÂ£o, Rodrigues","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.689919","20210705","SARS-CoV-2; academic environment; adaptation to COVID-19; coronavirus; mental health; public health; serology testing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15698,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Informal Caregiving and Care Receiving Across Europe During the First Phase of the Pandemic","<b>Purpose:</b> We analyzed the effects of COVID-19 as well as its accompanying epidemiological control measures on health-related outcomes (physical and mental health) and unmet care needs of both caregivers and care recipients across Europe and Israel by taking into account country differences. <b>Methods:</b> We applied comparisons of adjusted predictions, controlling for a large set of relevant respondent characteristics, to investigate changes in the physical and mental health of caregivers and care recipients due to COVID-19. Furthermore, multilevel regression models were used to analyze the effect of individual and contextual indicators on the probability of reporting difficulties in receiving care. For the analyses, we used data from 26 countries with 51,983 respondents over 50 years based on the eighth wave of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which had to be suspended in March 2020, and the SHARE Corona Survey fielded from June to August 2020. <b>Results:</b> During the first phase of the pandemic in spring/summer 2020, the frequency of providing personal care to parents increased in almost all European countries, while care to children, in turn, decreased. Parental caregivers who increased the frequency of providing personal care reported significantly more mental health strains, that is, feeling sad/depressed and anxious/nervous more often since the outbreak of the pandemic. With respect to receiving care, about one out of five care recipients had difficulty in obtaining adequate care from outside the household during the pandemic. The perception of unmet care needs was significantly associated with country differences regarding the duration of the stay-at-home orders. In contrast, the number of confirmed deaths did not have a significant effect on perceiving difficulties related to receiving care. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings show the extent of the burden to which caregivers and care recipients were exposed with respect to the unintended consequences of COVID-19-related epidemiological control measures. There is a great need within this population for interventions, which effectively reduce the burden as well as the symptoms of anxiety or depression for caregivers as well as care recipients. This should be recognized by (health) policymakers and social organizations.","Bergmann, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.673874","20210705","COVID-19; SHARE; epidemiological control measures; informal care; physical and mental health; stay at home orders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15699,""
"COVID-19-Related Stressors and Mental Health Among Chinese College Students: A Moderated Mediation Model","This study aims to examine the relation between COVID-19-related stressors and mental health among Chinese college students during the pandemic outbreaks, and the possible mediator or moderator between them.

The results shows that the number of stressors has a negative direct and indirect (through risk perception of being infected with COVID-19 disease) impacts on college students' mental health. Adaptive coping is a protective factor of students' mental health, and could be regarded as a buffer that attenuates the negative effect of the COVID-19-related stressors on risk perception of being infected with COVID-19 disease (or mental health). With regard to demographic variables, females, junior and senior students, or students whose family residence was worst hit by the pandemic tend to report poorer mental health during the pandemic outbreak.

"The Short-Term Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Psychiatric Patients: Evidence for Differential Emotion and Symptom Trajectories in Belgium","The spread of COVID-19 and the implementation of various containment strategies across the world have seriously disrupted people's everyday life, and it is especially uncertain what the psychological impact of this pandemic will be for vulnerable individuals, such as psychiatric (ex-)patients. Governments fear that this virus outbreak may prelude a major mental health crisis, and psychiatrists launch critical calls to flatten an upcoming mental ill-health surge. Here, we aim to add nuance to the idea that we are heading towards a mental health pandemic and that psychiatric populations will unavoidably (re)develop psychopathology. Despite being subjected to the same challenges posed by COVID-19, we argue that people with a history of psychiatric illness will psychologically deal with this adversity in different ways. To showcase the short-term differential impact of COVID-19 on patients' mental health, we present the day-to-day emotion and symptom trajectories of different psychiatric patients that took part in an experience sampling study before, during, and after the start of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and associated lockdown measures in Belgium. Piecewise regression models show that not all patients' psychological well-being is affected to a similar degree. As such, we argue that emphasizing human resilience, also among the more vulnerable in society, may be opportune in these unsettling times.","Dejonckheere, Houben, Schat, Ceulemans, Kuppens","https://doi.org/10.5334/pb.1028","20210705","COVID-19; experience sampling methods, psychological well-being; mental health crisis; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15703,""
"Self-compassion and the Mitigation of Negative Affect in the Era of Social Distancing","The outbreak of contagious diseases and their associated non-pharmaceutical interventions can lead to negative mental health consequences. This study aimed to investigate online self-compassion exercises' effectiveness in alleviating people's negative affect (anxiety and negative emotions) during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Study 1 examined the associations between self-compassion and negative affect using an anonymous online survey. In study 2, two pilot experiments were conducted to examine online self-compassion exercises' (i.e., instructor-guided meditation and self-guided writing) effectiveness to mitigate individuals' negative affect. In study 3, a randomized controlled study was conducted to further examine online self-compassion writing's effectiveness in reducing people's negative affect. The results of study 1 indicated a significant negative association between self-compassion and participants' negative affect. Participants in study 2a reported significant decreases in negative affect after completing the self-compassion meditation. Study 2b showed that participants who completed the self-compassion writing reported significantly more self-compassion and less anxiety when compared to participants who did not. Study 3 showed substantial pre/post-test changes in participants who completed self-compassion writing. Importantly, there were significant increases in participants' self-compassion and decreases in negative affect when compared to participants in the control condition. Self-compassion exercises were effective to alleviate individuals' anxiety and reduce negative emotions (even within a brief session) during the pandemic lockdown.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether anxiety and fear related to COVID-19 are influenced by sociodemographics and whether specific conditions, such as positivity for COVID-19 or death among relatives and friends, can further enhance these symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, 697 Italians responded to an online survey assessing sociodemographic information, the presence/absence of positive cases, or deaths due to COVID-19 among relatives or acquaintances. The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS-19S) were administered in order to assess the levels of anxiety and fear associated with COVID-19. The data were collected in November 2020. Anxiety and fear scores were positively correlated. Both male and female subjects with higher CAS scores also displayed higher FCS-19S scores. The CAS and FCS-19S scores tended to increase with age, with older subjects exhibiting higher scores than younger subjects. Additionally, respondents with lower educational levels demonstrated higher scores on both the CAS and FCS-19S. Similarly, respondents living with older people and/or experiencing the death of one or more relatives due to COVID-19 exhibited corresponding outcomes. This study demonstrates how the levels of anxiety and fear, measured by CAS and FCS-19S associated with COVID-19, are influenced by gender, age, cohabitation status, educational levels, and the presence of positive cases or deaths due to COVID-19.","OrrÃƒÂ¹, Bertelloni, Diolaiuti, Conversano, Ciacchini, Gemignani","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.669384","20210705","CAS; COVID-19 pandemic; FCS-19S; anxiety; fear; mental health; psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15705,""
"Cyberbullying Involvement, Resilient Coping, and Loneliness of Adolescents During Covid-19 in Rural China","Cyberbullying involvement can lead to internal health issues, especially mental health problems. Different coping strategies may reduce or enhance the strengths between cyberbullying experience and mental health problems. In this study, we examined the correlations between cyberbullying involvement and loneliness among a group of children and adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic in China, focusing on investigating the protecting effect of the resilient coping strategy. The results demonstrated that 86.68% of the students were not involved in cyberbullying activities, 8.19% were victims only, 1.89% was perpetrators only, and 3.24% were both victims and perpetrators. Compared with the non-involved, the victims-only group had a significantly higher degree of reported loneliness and a lower score of resilient coping, while the differences of the other groups were not significant. Resilient coping strategy can significantly reduce loneliness and play a mediating role between cyberbullying victimization and loneliness, but such mitigating effect was relatively weak. Besides, peer relations were the primary protective factors, and age was the primary risk factor of loneliness among the controlled variables. This study can enrich current knowledge of cyberbullying involvement and the psychological health among children and adolescents, especially in the context of the pandemic.","Han, Wang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.664612","20210705","China; Covid-19; adolescent; cyberbullying; loneliness; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15706,""
"Who Believes in COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories in Croatia? Prevalence and Predictors of Conspiracy Beliefs","The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to numerous new conspiracy theories related to the virus. This study aimed to investigate a range of individual predictors of beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories that account for sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, education, economic standard, the importance of religion, and political self-identification), distinctive motivational orientations (social dominance and authoritarianism), relevant social attitudes (sense of political powerlessness and trust in science and scientists), and perceived personal risk (perceived risk for self and family members, the concern of being infected, and the expected influence of pandemic on the economic standard of an individual). Participants were 1,060 adults recruited from the general public of Croatia. The sample was a probabilistic quota sample with gender, age, level of education, size of the dwelling, and region of the country as predetermined quotas. The regression model explained 42.2% of the individual differences in beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Trust in science and scientists and political powerlessness were the strongest predictors, whereas fear of being infected had the weakest contribution in explaining the variance of the criterion. Additionally, results revealed that the relation of conventionalism (as a proxy of authoritarianism) with belief in COVID-19 conspiracies was mediated by trust in science and scientists. The relation between social dominance and belief in conspiracies was also partially mediated by trust in science. The results suggest that (re)building trust in science and lowering the sense of political helplessness might help in fighting potentially harmful false beliefs about the pandemic.","TonkoviÃ„â€¡, DumanÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡, JeliÃ„â€¡, Ã„Å’orkalo BiruÃ…Â¡ki","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643568","20210705","COVID-19 conspiracy theories; authoritarianism; political powerlessness; social dominance; trust in science and scientists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15707,""
"Transforming Shame in the Pandemic: An International Study","Shame is an unconscious, somehow unattended and neglected emotion and occurs when individual and socio-cultural norms are violated. It often impacts negatively on the self and others across cultures. During the Covid-19 crises, shame has become an important emotion with a powerful effect, depending on how it is experienced within the socio-cultural context. This article explores shame in international perspectives in the context of Covid-19 and addresses the question how shame is transformed from an existential positive psychology (PP2.0) perspective. The study uses a qualitative research paradigm and explores shame and its transformation during Covid-19. Purposeful and snowball sampling was used. The sample consisted of 24 individuals (16 female, 8 male), of 13 different nationalities. Data were collected from written interviews and analyzed through thematic analysis. Ethical considerations were followed; ethical approval was given by a university. Findings show that participants become very worried, anxious, scared, sad, and shocked when they or individuals in their close relationships contracted Covid-19. Shame plays an important role during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the meaning and experience of shame during Covid-19 is strongly dependent on the socio-cultural background of the individual who is experiencing the disease. Individuals use different strategies and mechanisms to deal with and transform shame in the context of Covid-19.","Mayer, Vanderheiden","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.641076","20210705","COVID-19; meaning; mental health; positive psychology 2.0; shame; thematic analysis; transforming shame","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15708,""
"The Difficulties and Mental Health Intervention Need of Doctors and Nurses in Biological Emergencies: A Qualitative Study","When a biological public health event breaks out, due to the characteristics of their work, doctors and nurses must face risks directly when the situation is unknown. Their difficulties and psychological pressure are unimaginable. However, few studies have investigated the difficulties encountered by those doctors and nurses and their requirements for psychological interventions. This study aimed to explore the difficulties and psychological intervention needs of doctors and nurses during the new biological public health events in China in 2019. We carried out a qualitative study using a phenomenological approach. We used convenience sampling to identify participants who provided direct care and treatment for patients with biological events such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). They participated in semi-structured, in-depth face-to-face interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. Analysis of this study was divided into the difficulties encountered by doctors and nurses and their mental health need. The difficulties encountered by doctors and nurses included four themes: being worried about the impact on others, lack of knowledge and skills, difficult patients, being socially isolated, and the feeling of uncertainty. The mental health need was summarized into two parts, needs expressed by doctors and nurses and needs observed by researchers. Doctors and nurses mostly did not feel that they needed any psychological support, but the researchers noticed several signs of stress or potential mental health problems among interviewees. Doctors and nurses faced significant complex and multidimensional difficulties. Many denied needing psychological support, even though the researchers noted signs that it might be helpful. Interventions and support strategies that involve mental health promotion activities should consider individual needs related to doctors and nurses' situation.","Liang, Li, Chen, Tan, He, Sheng, Cai, Li, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.696823","20210705","2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19); biological disaster; doctors and nurses; mental health intervention needs; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15709,""
"Cross-Sectional Associations Between Lifetime Use of Psychedelic Drugs and Psychometric Measures During the COVID-19 Confinement: A Transcultural Study","<b>Background:</b> One of the main public health strategies adopted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic consisted of implementing strict lockdowns to stop the transmission of the virus. Despite being an effective measure, the confinement and the associated social isolation create a stressful, potentially lengthy situations that has been proven to have several psychological consequences. Given the potential benefits that certain psychedelic drugs have shown for the treatment of psychological disorders, this study aimed to assess the impact of lifetime psychedelic drug use on mental health in relation to the first strict lockdown adopted by various countries (April-July 2020). <b>Methods:</b> Subjects completed an online survey that inquired about sociodemographic factors, activities, and lifestyle factors during confinement, as well as health and mental health related factors. Subjects were asked about their lifetime use of psychedelic drugs (MDMA, ayahuasca, psilocybin-containing mushrooms, LSD, peyote, San Pedro, Bufo alvarius or 5-MeO-DMT, and others), being classified as regular users (more than once per 6 months), occasional users, or non-users. The survey included psychometric tests used to assess psychological distress, peritraumatic stress, social support, psychopathological symptoms, and personality. Linear regressions were performed with psychedelic drug users as the independent variable and psychometric factors as the outcomes, while correcting for age, gender, language, religion, spirituality, and use of non-psychedelic drugs. <b>Results:</b> The study included 2,974 English, Portuguese, and Spanish speakers (497 regular users of psychedelic drugs, 606 occasional users, and 1,968 non-users). On average, respondents were 36 years old and 70% were female. Psychedelic drug users, especially regular ones, reported less psychological distress, less peritraumatic stress, and more social support. Regarding personality measures, psychedelic drug users scored higher on the novelty-seeking and self-transcendence scales, and lower on cooperativeness. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings showed that regular users of psychedelic drugs had less psychological stress and some personality differences when compared to occasional users and non-users. This suggests that either the use of psychedelics might be a protective factor itself or people with certain previous traits are more prone to frequently using psychedelic drugs. Future prospective longitudinal research should investigate the underlying processes observed in this study to develop consistent hypotheses.","RÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©sz, Ona, Rossi, Rocha, Dos Santos, Hallak, AlcÃƒÂ¡zar-CÃƒÂ³rcoles, Bouso","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.687546","20210705","COVIDÃ¢Ë†â€™19; cross-cultural; distress; personality; psychedelic drugs; psychopathology; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15710,""

"Facemask Wearing Among Chinese International Students From Hong Kong Studying in United Kingdom Universities During COVID-19: A Mixed Method Study","<b>Background:</b> The mental health of international students studying abroad has been neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Objective:</b> This mixed-method study examined perceived public attitudes, personal beliefs, practice and stress toward facemask wearing as a preventive measure against COVID-19 among international University students from Hong Kong studying in the United Kingdom (UK) in the early stage (January-March 2020) of the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Our study included 2 parts: (i) an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling strategy was used to recruit 91 Chinese students studying in the UK to complete an online questionnaire survey, and (ii) online Zoom focus group interviews were conducted with 16 students who completed the online survey to gain an in-depth understanding of their experiences and coping methods during the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> Of the 91 students, 92.3% reported the UK public did not view facemask wearing as a preventive measure. 98.9% believed facemask wearing was an effective preventive measure, but 56% wore facemasks more than half of the time when out in public. 50.5% had internal conflicts of stress both when wearing and not wearing facemasks, which was more common in females than males [(62.5 vs. 31.5%), <i>P</i> = 0.004, Relative Risk (RR): 1.99 (1.17, 3.38)]. 61.5% reported public prejudiced attitudes against facemask wearing, also more common in females than males (71.4 vs. 45.7%), <i>P</i> = 0.02, RR: 1.56 (1.05, 2.32). The qualitative findings corroborated with the quantitative findings and reported that peer and family support were important for them to face such difficulties, and positive thinking and adaptability were effective methods on stress management. <b>Conclusions:</b> Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Chinese international students have been faced with a difficult, confusing, and sensitive situation. Owing to the ongoing pandemic, rising xenophobia and racist behaviors and the resumption of students' studies studies in the U.K., support from global communities are needed in their pursuit of quality education overseas. Our findings have significant implications on the proactive roles that governments should have, and the need for clear and accurate public health messaging to change public attitudes and mitigate prejudice.

"Psychological consequences of hospital isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic - research on the sample of polish firefighting academy students","Currently, a very important thread of research on COVID-19 is to determine the dimension of the psychopathological emotional reactions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. A non-experimental online research project was designed to determine the predictors of the severity of psychopathological symptoms, such as depression and PTSD symptoms, and the nature of the feedback mechanism between them in groups of men, remaining in hospital isolation due to infection and at-home isolation during the COVID-19 epidemic. The presence of symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a sense of threat due to the pandemic were assessed using the following screening tests: IES-R by Weiss and Marmar, PHQ-9 by Spitzer et al., and a self-constructed sliding scale for assessing COVID-19 anxiety. The study was carried out on a group of 57 firefighting cadets, hospitalized in a COVID-19 isolation room (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23.01), staying in isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and a control group of 57 healthy men (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41.38) staying at home during quarantine and national lockdown. COVID-19 pandemic causes many psychopathological reactions. The predictive models revealed that the predictors of symptoms of PTSD in isolated patients included depression and the experienced sense of COVID-19 threat resulting from the disease, while in the control group the symptoms of depression were the only predictor of PTSD. PTSD experiences are usually associated with depression. It may also be a form of the re-experiencing process or the effect of high affectivity, indirectly confirmed by the participation of hyperarousal in the feedback loop. Our findings highlight the importance of mental health aspects in patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic requires social distancing, quarantine and isolation, which may cause psychopathological symptoms not only in affected people, but also in the general population. Moreover, the need for greater psychological support can be emphasized for both: the sick and the general population.","Walecka, Ciechanowicz, Dopytalska, Mikucka-WituszyÃ…â€žska, SzymaÃ…â€žska, Bogucki, Kock, KuÃ…â€šakowska, TuszyÃ…â€žska-Bogucka","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01982-3","20210705","Coronavirus; Depression; Post Covid-19 traumatic stress syndrome; Post-traumatic stress disorder; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15713,""
"Comparison of counseling methods to promote employment for HIV+ ADULTS","Despite improved health and during a strong job market (pre-COVID-19), a substantial proportion of HIV+ adults remained unemployed. This study sought to provide time-limited counseling to promote employment goals. To determine whether behavioral activation (BA) or supportive counseling (SC), would be more effective in promoting vocational goals (full or part-time, paid or volunteer). The study included two groups: those with clinically significant fatigue, who were first treated with armodafinil. Once their fatigue diminished, they were enrolled in the counseling program. Those without fatigue were enrolled directly. Both BA and SC interventions were manualized, consisting of eight individual sessions plus a follow-up. 116 participants entered counseling, including 87 assigned to BA and 29 to SC. Of these, 79 completed counseling or found a job by session eight. By follow-up, 51%of BA versus 41%of SC participants had found jobs, a non-significant difference either clinically or statistically. Multiple issues contributed to difficulty in employment, including gaps in resumes, loss of contact with former colleagues, and uncertainty about career direction. Ongoing barriers included substance use, housing instability, ambivalence about forfeiting government benefits, as well as inadequately treated depression. Success in employment for about half of participants is, in this context, a reasonable outcome.","McElhiney, Rabkin, Wainberg, Finkel, Scodes","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-213529","20210705","HIV/AIDS; Return to work; behavioral activation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15714,""

"Health-related and socio-economic burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Vienna","Previous pandemics have rarely affected everyone equally and, so far, the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. Emerging evidence has shown that incidence rate, hospitalisation rate, and mortality due to COVID-19 are higher among people in lower socio-economic position (SEP). In addition, first investigations indicate that not everyone is equally affected by this pandemic's collateral public health damage. Using a stratified random sample of 1,004 participants living in Vienna, a Central European city with approximately 1.9Ã‚Â million inhabitants, this study analysed the distribution of 10 adverse health-related and socio-economic outcomes attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic across socio-economic strata. To this end, we estimated differences in the incidence rate of these outcomes by SEP and each of its indicators using zero-inflated Poisson and logistic regression models, adjusted for age and gender. Data were collected during first lockdown measures between 27 April and 17 May 2020. Differences in the incidence rate between the two lowest and two highest SEP groups were clearly visible. Participants in the lowest SEP category had a 32.96% higher incidence rate (IRRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.333 [95% CI: 1.079-1.639]), and participants in the second lowest SEP category had a 44.69% higher incidence rate (IRRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.447 [95% CI: 1.190-1.760]) compared with participants in the highest SEP category. In sum, 6 out of 10 adverse COVID-19-related outcomes were, to a greater or lesser extent, disproportionately experienced by Viennese residents in lower SEP. Inequalities were most visible between income groups and for the outcomes job loss, worsening of the financial situation, and worse mental health. These results strengthen and extend the current evidence on the unequally distributed burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of effect heterogeneity across SEP indicators, we encourage future investigators to pay increased attention to their operationalisation of SEP.

Whilst national and international COVID-19 lockdown and travel restriction measures have had widespread negative impact on economies and mental health, they may have beneficial effect on the environment, reducing air and water pollution. Mass bathing events (MBE) also known as Kumbh Mela are known to cause perturbations of the ecosystem affecting resilient bacterial populations within water of rivers in India. Lockdowns and travel restrictions provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of minimum anthropogenic activity on the river water ecosystem and changes in bacterial populations including antibiotic-resistant strains. We performed a spatiotemporal meta-analysis of bacterial communities of the Godavari River, India. Targeted metagenomics revealed a 0.87-fold increase in the bacterial diversity during the restricted activity of lockdown. A significant increase in the resilient phyla, viz. Proteobacteria (70.6%), Bacteroidetes (22.5%), Verrucomicrobia (1.8%), Actinobacteria (1.2%) and Cyanobacteria (1.1%), was observed. There was minimal incorporation of allochthonous bacterial communities of human origin. Functional profiling using imputed metagenomics showed reduction in infection and drug resistance genes byÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.71-fold andÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.64-fold, respectively. These observations may collectively indicate the positive implications of COVID-19 lockdown measures which restrict MBE, allowing restoration of the river ecosystem and minimise the associated public health risk.","Jani, Bandal, Shouche, Shafi, Azhar, Zumla, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01781-0","20210705","Antibiotic resistance; Bacterial populations; COVID-19; Kumbh Mela; Lockdown measures; Public health; Targeted metagenomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15719,""
"Psychological Effects on Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Single-center Study at a Tertiary Hospital in Tokyo, Japan","Objective The present study analyzed the psychological status of healthcare workers in Japan and the influencing factors during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. Methods An online survey was conducted from July 22 to August 21, 2020. A total of 328 of the 1,029 medical staff members in our university hospital participated in the study. Their mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with the mental health outcomes. Results Of the respondents, 78.0% reported psychological distress. Overall, we found that women, non-physicians, those who lived alone, and younger respondents had significantly greater psychological distress than their counterparts. The multivariate regression analysis showed that four factors were extracted as independent 12-item General Health Questionnaire-related factors: the lack of a sense of mission as a medical professional, the burden of the change in the quality of work, the lack of understanding about virus infectivity, and a strong sense of duty. Conclusion In summary, we found a high prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare workers during the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak in Japan. Independent risk factors for psychological distress were the burden of the change in the quality of work, the lack of understanding about virus infectivity, a sense of responsibility, and the lack of a strong motivation and drive to help.","Ishikawa, Ogasawara, Takahashi, Ono, Matsui, Marshall, Sakurai, Aoka, Otsubo, Sato, Sakura, Uchigata","https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.7207-21","20210705","12-item General Health Questionnaire; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Health survey; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15720,""

"The Views of People Who Experienced the Reduction of the Concerns in the COVID-19 Quarantine Process by Making Physical Activity at Home","COVID-19 affects the whole world and restricts the social life globally. The obligation to stay at home can cause psychological disorders for people. For this reason, physical activities at home are crucial to reduce the level of anxiety, protect against negative feelings, and strengthen the mental health. This study aims to investigate how COVID-19 affects the social life and the anxiety levels of people at home during the quarantine process within the framework of a solution-oriented approach. In this study, one of the qualitative research patterns ""phenomenology"" has been used to determine the opinions of the participants. The study group of the research consists of 14 people with moderate income who actively participate in anxiety-reducing activities of an International Coach Federation (ICF) consultancy center in Ã„Â°stanbul. The themes have been created in line with the answers obtained by the result of content analysis as ""questioning the process, understanding yourself, internal purification,"" and sub-themes of these determined themes have also been created. It has been concluded that during quarantine; excessively exposed to media, the state of uncertainty about the end of the pandemic, the thought of themselves or their loved ones catching the virus, and the application of social isolation increase the anxiety. However, the participants have stated that by the help of physical activities performed at home, sleep disorders have been eliminated, concentration deficiency in activities carried out from home improved, and anger and tension decreased. As a result, it is concluded that participants' stress and anxiety levels are reduced by physical activity at home.","Ercan","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2021.1941477","20210705","Anxiety; COVID 19; physical activity; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15722,""
"The Relationship Between Anxiety and Hopelessness Levels Among Nursing Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Related Factors","Outbreaks caused by environmental effects such as COVID-19, MERS, SARS, or Ebola cause problems such as fear, anxiety, loneliness, depression, and hopelessness for people with or without a high risk of illness. This study aims to determine the levels of hopelessness and anxiety experienced by nursing students during the COVID-19 outbreak. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with students of a state university. In the collection of the data, Descriptive Characteristics Form prepared by the researchers, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Test (GAD-7), and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) were used. The mean GAD-7 score of the students participating in the study was 6.65Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.03 and the mean BHS score was 6.11Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.91. It was determined that the score of GAD-7 and BHS were a significant positive high relationship between them (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Anxiety and hopelessness levels were found to be statistically significantly higher for those whose sleep and eating patterns affected negatively due to the pandemic, those who feared the pandemic and its economic effects, and those who did not want to work in the hospital during the pandemic period.

"Traumatic Effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Middle School Students and Caregivers","To investigate the traumatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on middle-school students and their parents. This epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted with middle-school students in Denizli. A questionnaire consisting of the IES-R, CRIES-13 and a sociodemographic data form was delivered online. A total of 1059 participants who fully completed the questionnaire were included for analysis. The IES-R total and subdimension scores and the CRIES-13 scores were found to be significantly higher in families with an income level of Ã¢â€°Â¤2,500 TL. The CRIES-13 scores of children were found to be significantly higher in divorced families. No statistically significant difference was determined between the IES-R total and subdimension scores of the parents who were healthcare workers and the CRIES-13 scale scores of their children. A statistically significant, positive, moderate relationship was found between the IES-R scale total and subdimension scores of parents and the CRIES-13 scale scores of children. A low socioeconomic level was seen to increase the prevalence of anxiety in adults and adolescents. The children of divorced families were found to be at higher risk of PTSD.

"[Mental health protection associated with COVID-19]","Mental health is a state of mental well-being in which people are able to cope with stressful situations in life and can bring their life potential to their communities. Good mental health enables people to fulfill their roles in both family and society. When crises affect social life, people should be expected to experience high levels of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the physical health crisis, may also contribute to the exacerbation of stress and the emergence of mental illnesses. Many individuals suffer due to forced isolation or feel socially excluded. Also, many of them fear infection, death and losing family members. Moreover, specific population groups show varying degrees of COVID-19-related psychological stress. The paper presents the psychological problems of the consequences of COVID-19 in society based on a review of the latest articles available in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The discussed material points to different needs in terms of psychological support in the society. People in unstable living conditions are at a greater risk of losing their mental health. Moreover, their mental health needs may be completely overlooked. Emotional difficulties may worsen among children and adolescents as a result of both family stress and social isolation. It is essential to include mental health protection in health policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the recovery of communities.","OgÃ…â€šodek","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Mental+health+protection+associated+with+COVID-19].","20210704","coronavirus; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15725,""
"Triggering of postpartum depression and insomnia with cognitive impairment in Argentinian women during the pandemic COVID-19 social isolation in relation to reproductive and health factors","The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) required strict confinement measures that differentially impacted the individual's daily life. Thus, this work aimed to study postpartum women's mental health in Argentina during mandatory social isolation. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to July 2020, which included five validated questionnaires to assess postpartum depression (Postpartum Depression Screening Scale-Short Form), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), memory complaints (Memory Complaint Scale), metacognition (Brief Metamemory and Metaconcentration Scale), and breastfeeding self-efficacy (Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form). Sociodemographic variables, social isolation characteristics, and breastfeeding practices were also collected. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Statistical analysis included zero-order correlations, multiple logistic regressions, and a set of structural equation models (SEM) to test direct and indirect effects. Goodness-of-fit indices were calculated for SEM. Postpartum women were recruited from public hospitals, private health clinics, and online community recruitment in the Cordoba province (Argentina). 305 postpartum women from Argentina. 37% of women reported postpartum depression, 46% insomnia, 42% memory impairment, 60% low metaconcentration, 50% low metamemory, and 23% low breastfeeding efficacy. Also, significant associations were found demonstrating that social isolation promoted postpartum depression and insomnia were reciprocally related, which compromised female cognition and efficacy. This situation was aggravated in women during late postpartum, with previous children, and by low social support (e.g., family, health professionals), with non-exclusive breastfeeding being increased. This is the first study addressing postpartum women's mental status during social isolation in Argentina, which was a promoting factor for postpartum depression and insomnia that were reciprocally related. This situation was also aggravated by reproductive factors, such as late postpartum, multiparity, breastfeeding frequency, and non-exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, breastfeeding self-efficacy depended on mental health status, and euthymia therefore favoured the practice of exclusive breastfeeding.","Miranda, Scotta, Cortez, Soria","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.103072","20210704","Cognitive dysfunction; Depression, Postpartum; Metacognition; Pandemics; Self efficacy; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15726,""
"Anxiety, depressive, and trauma symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evaluating the role of disappointment with God","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to pervasive social and economic disruptions. This cross-sectional investigation aimed to evaluate associations between religious/spiritual factors and mental health symptoms among community residents in a southern US state. In particular, we focused on perceptions of God's distance, a salient aspect of religious/spiritual struggle that has received little scrutiny in health research. Participants included 551 respondents assessed during a period of gradual reopening but rising infection rates. Mental health outcomes were assessed using standardized measures of generalized anxiety, depression, and trauma symptoms. Perceptions of an affirming relationship with God, anger at God, and disappointment at God's distance were evaluated using an adapted version of the Attitudes-Toward-God Scale-9. In multivariate analyses that accounted for pandemic-related and demographic factors, positive relationships with God were related to diminished symptoms on all three mental heatlh indices (all p's Ã¢â€°Â¤.003), whereas disappointment with God's distance was associated with more pronounced difficulties (all p's Ã¢â€°Â¤.014). The cross-sectional design precludes causal conclusions. Findings suggest that perceived relationships with God are tied to clinically relevant mental health outcomes during periods of major upheaval. Disappointment with God's distance may be an important, understudied dimension of religious/spiritual struggle meriting further investigation.","Sherman, Park, Salsman, Williams, Amick, Hudson, Messias, Simonton-Atchley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.045","20210704","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Relationships with God; Religiousness; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15727,""
"The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on individuals with gastrointestinal disorders: A protocol of an international collaborative study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health across the globe. People living with a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder might be particularly at risk of mental health complications given higher rates of comorbid anxiety and depression compared to the healthy population. As GI disorders affect up to 40% of the population worldwide, this international collaborative study seeks to evaluate the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on GI symptoms specifically and more generally on the well-being of those living with chronic GI conditions. A longitudinal survey with three time points (baseline, 6-month, and 12-month) will be conducted online. Adult participants with GI disorders from multiple countries will be recruited via patient associations, social media advertising, utilizing snowball sampling. Participants will be invited to complete a battery of questionnaires including demographic and health parameters, and measures of gastrointestinal symptoms, fear of COVID-19, perceived impact of COVID-19, illness perceptions, coping, depression, anxiety, stress, catastrophizing, and quality of life, using validated measures where available. Statistical analyses will include univariate descriptive models, multivariate models utilizing regression, mediation, and moderation, and latent growth models. This project may present novel information to the field of psychogastroenterology and may provide crucial information regarding the areas of impact for individuals with GI disorders during and following the pandemic. Further, this information can guide healthcare providers and patient associations on how to target support related to the pandemic mental health sequelae for these patients.","Ferreira, Mikocka-Walus, van Tilburg, Graff, Apputhurai, Acosta, Evertsz, Burisch, Lo, Petrik, Trindade, Jedel, Moser, Mokrowiecka, Bernstein, Dumitrascu, Ford, Stengel, Gearry, Knowles","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110561","20210704","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Gastrointestinal disorders; Mental health; Quality of life; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15728,""

"Association between perceived discriminations and mental health outcomes among health workers during the initial COVID-19 outbreak","During the initial COVID-19 outbreak, health systems faced unprecedented organizational stress. Meanwhile, reports of episodes of discrimination and violence towards healthcare workers increased globally. This study explores the association between perceived discrimination and mental health outcomes in a large sample of healthcare workers in Spain. Healthcare workers from inpatient and outpatient facilities (N=2053) filled an on-line questionnaire in May or June 2020. Mental health outcomes included depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-12]) and death thoughts (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]). We also measured perceived discrimination and/or stigmatization due to being a healthcare worker since pandemic onset. Regression models adjusted for potential confounding sources (age, sex, history of a mental health diagnosis and type of job) were fitted. Thirty percent of the respondents reported discrimination and/or stigmatization. Perceived discrimination was associated with higher depression (B=2.4, 95 percent CI: 1.8, 2.9) and psychological distress (B=1.1, 95 percent CI: 0.7, 1.4) scores, and with a 2-fold increase in risk of reporting death thoughts (OR=2.0, 95 percent CI: 1.4, 3.1). Perceived discrimination is a modifiable driver of mental health problems among healthcare workers. Mass media, legislators, and healthcare institutions must put in place prevention and restoration strategies to limit discrimination towards healthcare workers and reduce its mental health impact.","Mediavilla, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Andreo, MorÃƒÂ¡n-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, JosÃƒÂ©, Moreno-KÃƒÂ¼stner, Mascayano, Ayuso-Mateos, Bravo-Ortiz, MartÃƒÂ­nez-AlÃƒÂ©s","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.06.001","20210705","COVID-19; DepresiÃƒÂ³n; Depression; DiscriminaciÃƒÂ³n; Discrimination; Estigma; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Salud mental; Stigma; Trabajadores sanitarios","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-06","",15730,""
"The quality of life, resources, and coping during the first weeks of the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic in people seeking psychological counselling before the pandemic","This study aimed to understand the relationship between resource gains and losses, coping, and the quality of life during the growth phase of the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic. The Internet-based survey covered 353 individuals who had participated in a psychological support project operated by one of the non-governmental organizations in Lublin, Poland, in the 12 months prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study contained questions to collect sociodemographic data and psychometric scales to measure resource gains and losses (the <i>Conservation of Resources</i> - <i>Evaluation</i> questionnaire), the quality of life (the <i>World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF</i>), and strategies of coping with the pandemic situation (a modified <i>Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced</i> questionnaire). A higher global quality of life occurred with higher gains and minor losses, as well as with coping through planning, positive reframing, emotional support seeking, a reduced substance use tendency, low self-blame, avoidance, and disengagement. Moreover, helplessness-based coping strategies were found to mediate both the relationships between resource gains and the quality of life, and between resource losses and the quality of life. Factors that may reduce people's quality of life during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic are an increase in losses and limited gains, experienced over the 6 months preceding the pandemic, as well as not using active, meaning-oriented, and support-seeking coping strategies, but using avoidance behaviors instead. Coping strategies specific to people experiencing helplessness are a mediating mechanism between losses and limited gains of resources, and the quality of life.
