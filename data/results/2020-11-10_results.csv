"A pandemia no cÃ¡rcere: intervenÃ§Ãµes no superisolamento; The pandemic in prison: interventions and overisolation","Resumo SaÃºde prisional Ã©, em sua essÃªncia, saÃºde pÃºblica. A pandemia de COVID-19 representa uma grande ameaÃ§a para o mundo e tem demonstrado que prevenir a escalada da doenÃ§a em prisÃµes faz parte do combate ao novo coronavÃ­rus na sociedade em geral. Sabe-se, atÃ© o momento, que a mais efetiva medida de contenÃ§Ã£o ao avanÃ§o da doenÃ§a Ã© o isolamento social. No entanto, em instituiÃ§Ãµes penais, muitas vezes superlotadas, tal medida torna-se de difÃ­cil implementaÃ§Ã£o e, quando acontece, leva a populaÃ§Ã£o privada de liberdade a um superisolamento, tendo consequÃªncias em sua saÃºde mental. AlÃ©m disso, indivÃ­duos presos sofrem com ambientes sem ventilaÃ§Ã£o, falta de materiais de higiene pessoal, condiÃ§Ãµes sanitÃ¡rias bÃ¡sicas precÃ¡rias e dificuldade de acesso a serviÃ§os de saÃºde. O presente artigo objetiva ser uma revisÃ£o narrativa sobre os efeitos da pandemia em presÃ­dios e como governos e sociedade civil tÃªm se organizado a fim de reduzir as consequÃªncias sobre esses locais. A publicaÃ§Ã£o foi dividida em trÃªs seÃ§Ãµes: na primeira, hÃ¡ uma revisÃ£o da literatura em saÃºde sobre a temÃ¡tica; na segunda, Ã© tratado o modo como diferentes paÃ­ses estÃ£o lidando com a situaÃ§Ã£o carcerÃ¡ria no contexto da pandemia; na terceira e Ãºltima parte, Ã© abordado o modo como o Sistema Penal brasileiro tem reagido Ã  nova doenÃ§a.; Abstract Prisional health is, in its essence, public health. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to the world and has shown that preventing the disease escalation in prisons integrates the novel corona virus clash in society in general. Up to this moment, the most effective known measure to curb the disease spread is social isolation. Nevertheless, in penal institutions, often overcrowded, social isolation becomes difficult to carry out and, when it happens, it takes the enclosed population to overisolation, with consequences to their mental health. Besides, prisoners suffer with clogged up environment, lack of materials for personal hygiene, poor basic sanitary conditions and difficulties in accessing health services. This paper deals with a narrative review on the pandemic effects in prisons and how government and civil society have organized themselves in order to reduce the disease consequences at those places. The text has been divided into three sections: the first with literature review on the current health theme; the second discusses how different countries have been dealing with the prison situation in the pandemic context, and, the last part focuses on how the Brazilian Penal System has reacted to the new disease.","Carvalho, SÃ©rgio GarÃ³falo de; Santos, Andreia Beatriz Silva dos; Santos, Ivete Maria","http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-81232020001003493","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: LILACS; Publication details: CiÃªnc.

"A saÃºde dos profissionais de saÃºde no enfrentamento da pandemia de Covid-19; The health of healthcare professionals coping with the Covid-19 pandemic","Resumo Este trabalho tem como objetivo sistematizar um conjunto de evidÃªncias cientÃ­ficas apresentadas em artigos internacionais que identificam os principais problemas que estÃ£o afetando os profissionais de saÃºde envolvidos diretamente no enfrentamento da pandemia de COVID-19 e apontam aÃ§Ãµes e estratÃ©gias para a proteÃ§Ã£o e a assistÃªncia Ã  saÃºde desses profissionais. O principal problema Ã© o risco de contaminaÃ§Ã£o que tem gerado afastamento do trabalho, doenÃ§a e morte, alÃ©m de intenso sofrimento psÃ­quico, que se expressa em transtorno de ansiedade generalizada, distÃºrbios do sono, medo de adoecer e de contaminar colegas e familiares. Situando esta problemÃ¡tica na realidade brasileira, este artigo resgata a anÃ¡lise dos problemas crÃ´nicos que afetam os trabalhadores de saÃºde, decorrentes do sub-financiamento do SUS, do congelamentos dos gastos no setor, da deterioraÃ§Ã£o dos serviÃ§os e da precarizaÃ§Ã£o da forÃ§a de trabalho e aponta os desafios agudos que se apresentam Ã  gestÃ£o do trabalho e capacitaÃ§Ã£o de pessoal, diante da expansÃ£o da infraestrutura de leitos hospitalares e da reorganizaÃ§Ã£o do processo de trabalho na atenÃ§Ã£o bÃ¡sica para o enfrentamento da pandemia, enfatizando as medidas necessÃ¡rias para a proteÃ§Ã£o e a promoÃ§Ã£o da saÃºde fÃ­sica e mental dos profissionais e trabalhadores da saÃºde.; Abstract This work aims to systematize a set of scientific evidence presented in international papers that identify the main problems affecting health professionals directly involved in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and point out actions and strategies for the protection and healthcare of these professionals. The risk of infection is the main issue and has led to absence from work, illness, death, and intense psychological distress, expressed in generalized anxiety and sleep disorders, fear of becoming ill and infecting colleagues and relatives. In the Brazilian reality, this work revives the analysis of the chronic problems affecting health workers, resulting from the underfinancing of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), the sector's spending freeze, the deterioration of services and workforce's insecurity, and points out the acute challenges of work management and staff training, given the expanded hospital bed infrastructure and reorganization of the work process in primary care to face the pandemic, emphasizing the necessary measures for the protection and promotion of the physical and mental health of health professionals and workers.","Teixeira, Carmen Fontes de Souza; Soares, Catharina Matos; Souza, Ednir Assis; Lisboa, Erick Soares; Pinto, Isabela Cardoso de Matos; Andrade, LaÃ­se Rezende de; EspiridiÃ£o, Monique Azevedo","http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-81232020001003465","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: LILACS; Publication details: CiÃªnc.

"Applying the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) to medical, veterinary and dual degree Master of Public Health (MPH) students at a private medical institution","Purpose With the emergence of zoonoses such as Ebola, many medical educators, have recommended the need for providing Interprofessional Education (IPE) as a pedagogical tool for familiarizing medical (MD) students with the framework of One Health (OH)  This is important as students need to understand, the wider impacts of animal and environmental health factors on human health  IPE initiatives which typically incorporate the principles of OH, can provide MD and veterinary (DVM) students with a greater awareness of the role that animal diseases and climate change have on global health  However, negative attitudes to IPE have been reported as a key limitation to IPE implementation  The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences in readiness for interprofessional learning of medical and other allied human health professional students, including veterinarians and students undertaking dual degrees in combination with a Master of Public Health (MPH)  Reflecting on Role Theory (RT) and Social Identity Theory (SIT), the paper aims to contribute to the understanding of differences in perceptions that exist between different types of health professionals  Methods Students at a medical University enrolled in MD, DVM, DVM MPH and MD MPH programs, were invited to complete the standardized Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS), which consists of 19 Likert scale items measuring concepts relating to teamwork, professional identity and roles and responsibilities  A total of 364 students across the four programs took part  Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to assess differences between the programmes  Results Results indicate that MD students score lower on the different RIPLS items compared to DVM, MD MPH and DVM MPH students  DVM and DVM MPH students are generally more positive about the need for teamwork, while MD MPH and DVM MPH students have a stronger positive identity about the need for IPE  Conclusions The findings drawn from this study suggests that the MD students keep on seeing themselves as a separate group of health professionals in their own right  In order to guarantee an increased level of understanding on issues relating to the human-animal-environmental spectrum, medical curricula might benefit from the incorporation of shared learning and teamwork, as occurs within the MPH, enabling students to appreciate the value of interprofessional collaboration to their future practice  This is especially important during a time at which human-animal-environmental issues are affecting social and economic life worldwide","Roopnarine, Rohini, Boeren, Ellen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234462","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: PLoS One;15(6), 2020.; Publication details: PLoS One;15(6), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6937,""

"Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Student Wellbeing at Universities in the United Kingdom: A Conceptual Analysis","Transitioning into the university environment can be both exciting and stressful for new and returning students alike  The pressure to perform well academically in an increasingly competitive environment, coupled with a vast array of lifestyle changes, can contribute to suboptimal wellbeing  Over recent years, uptake to wellbeing services within universities in the United Kingdom has grown given the concurrent rise in mental health difficulties reported  Higher education students now have to contend with a drastically altered learning landscape, owing to the discovery of novel coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2, otherwise referred to as COVID-19  In the United Kingdom, universities have moved to close their campuses to both students and non-essential staff in an effort to protect them from contracting the virus  The repercussions of these decisions have been monumental for the delivery of teaching, relationships and, importantly, the provision of student services  Ambiguity remains as to how teaching will be delivered for the forthcoming academic year  The uncertainty caused by the pandemic has yet to be considered in terms of student wellbeing and the new, mostly online, environments that students will be expected to navigate without their typical support networks  For the purpose of this paper, the concept of student wellbeing, a population-level term concerned with positive emotions rather than diagnosed mental health conditions, will be considered in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak  The current paper performs a conceptual analysis on student wellbeing in United Kingdom universities with a specific lens on the psychosocial impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak  Given the unprecedented world that students now learn in, considering the impact of the pandemic on psychosocial outcomes delineates the novel challenges that researchers and practitioners must consider when implementing student wellbeing initiatives moving forward  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Burns, Dagnall and Holt","Burns, D.; Dagnall, N.; Holt, M.","https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2020.582882","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Education;5, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Education;5, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6941,""
"CoViD-19: perspectivas y vulnerabilidad","Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread worldwide as a pandemic  It is noteworthy that CoViD-19 surpassed the health care system in many countries, due to the speed of its spread and the lack of foresight at the health level, as well as the underestimation of its contagiousness  Furthermore, being a new and unknown nosological entity, there are still no treatments that have been proven to be scientifically effective, safe;as well as a vaccine that will not destroy the pandemic  Therefore, the only response so far has been to try to limit the spread of the disease through good hygiene practices and social distancing  All this has caused the closure of the main parts of the economy and sudden high unemployment, causing negative consequences and a recession never seen before  The most widely adopted strategies have involved the epidemiological approach of promoting good hygiene practices and social distancing, including shelter-in-place and quarantine orders  These strategies have had varying degrees of success depending on the country  The common phrase used to describe the objective of this epidemiological approach is to flatten the curve, an effect that is achieved by reducing the number of infections  This approach was also a way to buy time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways of treatment, prepare health systems, that is, develop validated therapies and vaccines  Another approach would be to re-establish the economy more quickly and thus help the entire population avoid the profound adverse effects of a severe recession or depression on society and health;As well as, it would increase community immunity, lowering the risk for everyone, including those most susceptible to serious adverse outcomes, and those who develop immunity could donate serum fortified with antibodies, which could provide effective treatment as they develop and try vaccines and effective treatments to fight the disease  The balance between the strategies of the epidemiological approach to attenuate the contagion curve and the attempt to reopen a population and its economy will be the key to a successful future  This article was written with the hope of helping professionals understand the problems caused by CoViD-19","PerroneÂ¹, Sergio V.; BevacquaÂ², RaÃºl J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=CoViD-19:+perspectivas+y+vulnerabilidad","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Insuficiencia cardÃ­aca;15(1):19-26, 2020.; Publication details: Insuficiencia cardÃ­aca;15(1):19-26, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6942,""

The disease is highly communicable and produces mild to severe symptoms, generating a high demand for intensive care and thousands of deaths. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and has already surpassed five million cases and 300,000 deaths in the world. The natural history of the disease has still not been fully established, hindering the elaboration of effective clinical protocols and preventive measures. Nevertheless, the disease requires a systemic approach, since there is evidence of acute and chronic complications, in addition to the catastrophic effects on the population's mental health. This highlights the need for a methodology that more effectively captures the effect of COVID-19, considering such aspects as severity, duration, and the potential to generate chronic complications that will increase the demands on Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). DALYs, or disability-adjusted life years, are thus an extremely useful indictor that adds mortality, an estimate of years of life lost (YLLs), and morbidity, an estimate of years of life lived with disability (YLDs). This article discusses the relevance and difficulties of studying the burden of COVID-19 and its complications in the Brazilian context, highlighting the natural history of the disease and estimating indicators such as YLDs, considering the high burden of disease in planning strategies to deal with the consequences of COVID-19 after the pandemic. The article also discusses the future challenges to deal with the disease in the SUS and the effects on the calculation of DALYs.","Campos, MÃ´nica Rodrigues; Schramm, Joyce Mendes de Andrade; Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins; Rodrigues, JÃ©ssica Muzy; Avelar, Fernando Genovez de; Pimentel, Thiago Goes","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020001103001; http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020001103001","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36(11): e00148920, 2020.; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36(11): e00148920, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6947,""
"Anxiety of Nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 Epidemic and its Correlation With Work Stress and Social Support","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the anxiety of nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and explore relevant influencing factors. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak pose a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses is limited. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. METHODS: An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: The score of SAS, SOS and GSES are range from 20 - 80, 22 - 110 and 10 - 40 respectively, the SAS (31.79Â±7.32) and SOS (40.19Â±12.92) and GSES scores (24.83Â±6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (r=0.679, P<0.001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r=-0.326, p<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress, and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (p=0.006, <0.001, <0.001, 0.039, respectively).

"Lessons in Resilience: Initial Coping among Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In addition to increased physical health risks, older adults may also experience risks to their mental health and social wellbeing due to COVID-19. Yet, older adults may be uniquely able to cope given their life experiences and coping mechanisms. This study explores older adults' coping experiences and strategies during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70-97 completed a phone interview about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. Interviews were conducted during early weeks of regional social distancing (March 28-April 20, 2020). Participants rated their level of perceived coping and responded to open-ended questions about their daily life and coping. RESULTS: Mean perceived coping level (on a scale from 1-10) was 7.9, with 87% of participants rating their coping positively. Primary themes that emerged included: 1) staying busy, 2) seeking social support, and 3) having a positive mindset. These emotion-focused coping strategies appeared adaptive in the early weeks of the pandemic for most older adults. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Contrary to predominant messaging about the vulnerability of older adults, these findings highlight the resilient nature of older adults in terms of their psychological coping and adaptability during COVID-19. Future research should build upon these findings to better understand and promote late-life coping during crises. Practitioners should seek to support older adults' engagement in such proactive coping, and social policies should be developed to acknowledge the variable needs of older adults.","Fuller, Heather R; Huseth-Zosel, Andrea","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa170","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gerontologist;2020 Nov 02.; Publication details: Gerontologist;2020 Nov 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6949,""
"Possible application of high-dose vitamin C in the prevention and therapy of coronavirus infection","Coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses increase oxidative stress in the body leading to cellular and tissue damage. To combat this, administration of high-dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate), in addition to standard conventional supportive treatments, has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy for severe cases of respiratory viral infection. Morbidity, mortality, infectiveness and spread of infectious diseases are dependent on the host-pathogen relationship. Given the lack of effective and safe antiviral drugs for coronaviruses, there should be more attention in supporting host immune defence, cytoprotection and immunoregulation. Implementation of high-dose vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterials and antiviral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive and toxic, complicating the disease course. In order to effectively fight the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, medical professionals should explore readily available pharmaceutical and nutritional therapeutic agents with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunosupportive properties. Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease.","Hoang, X; Shaw, Graeme; Fang, Willian; Han, Bo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.09.025","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Glob Antimicrob Resist;23: 256-262, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: J Glob Antimicrob Resist;23: 256-262, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6950,""
"Folgen der COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie fÃ¼r die Gastroenterologie in Deutschland; [Consequences of the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for gastroenterology in Germany]","The recommendations of the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in gastroenterological patients are accessible on the homepage of the Society under information at https://www.dgvs.de/covid-19/. Recommendations for protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been published by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA). Separate endoscopy rooms for high-risk patients and negative pressure rooms should be included in the planning of future endoscopy unit projects. It is unclear whether aÂ continuing prioritization of gastroenterological services after the first wave of COVID-19 is necessary in the future. The report of the Scientific Institute of the AOK health insurance company (WldO) and surveys of the Working Group of Clinical Gastroenterologists (ALGK) and the Professional Association of Private Gastroenterologists in Germany (bng) demonstrated that the coronavirus lockdown led to aÂ significant reduction of gastrointestinal diseases and gastroenterological services including screening colonoscopy. It is likely that the reduction of the overcapacity of the German healthcare system will also be continued by reduction of inpatient services after the corona pandemic has been overcome. It is essential to keep the medical profession attractive for young colleagues.

"The mental health of healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","Purpose: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is widely spreading all over the world, causing mental health problems for most people. The medical staff is also under considerable psychological pressure. This study aimed to review all research carried out on the mental health status of health care workers (HCWs) to bring policymakers and managers' attention. Methods: A literature search conducted through e-databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) from December 2019 up to April 12th 2020. All cross- sectional studies published in English which assessed the health workers' psychological well-being during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic included. Study quality was analyzed using NHLBI Study Quality assessment tools. Results: One hundred relevant articles were identified through systematic search; of which eleven studies were eligible for this review. Their quality score was acceptable. The lowest reported prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among HCWs was 24.1%, 12.1%, and 29.8%, respectively. In addition, the highest reported values for the aforementioned parameters were 67.55%, 55.89%, and 62.99%, respectively. Nurses, female workers, front-line health care workers, younger medical staff, and workers in areas with higher infection rates reported more severe degrees of all psychological symptoms than other health care workers. Moreover, vicarious traumatization in non-front-line nurses and the general public was higher than that of the front-line nurses. Conclusion: During SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the health care workers face aggravated psychological pressure and even mental illness. It would be recommended to the policymakers and managers to adopt the supportive, encouragement & motivational, protective, and training & educational interventions, especially through information and communication platform.","Vizheh, Maryam; Qorbani, Mostafa; Arzaghi, Seyed Masoud; Muhidin, Salut; Javanmard, Zohreh; Esmaeili, Marzieh","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40200-020-00643-9","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Diabetes Metab Disord;: 1-12, 2020 Oct 26.; Publication details: J Diabetes Metab Disord;: 1-12, 2020 Oct 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6952,""

"Perception and Feelings of Antenatal Women during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey","To assess the level of anxiety and knowledge regarding COVID-19 amongst antenatal women. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in the antenatal clinics of KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, from 31 March to 25 April 2020 to assess pregnant women's knowledge of COVID-19, their perceptions of its impact upon pregnancy and psychological impact using the validated Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21). Of the 324 women who participated in the study, the mean age was 31.8 years (range, 20-45). The majority (53.7%) were multiparous with mean gestational age of 23.4 weeks (SD 10). The commonest sources of information were Internet-based social media platforms. A significant proportion were unaware, or associated COVID-19 infection during pregnancy with fetal distress (82.1%), intrauterine death (71.3%), fetal anomalies (69.8%), miscarriages (64.8%), preterm labour (67.9%) and rupture of membranes (61.4%). A total of 116 (35.8%) women screened positive for anxiety, 59 (18.2%) for depression, and 36 (11.1%) for stress. There was a significant association between household size and stress scores [B = 0.0454 (95% CI, 0.0035-0.0873)].

"The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in smoking behavior: Evidence from a nationwide survey in the UK","The stress and anxiety during this unprecedented public health crisis may lead current smokers to increase tobacco use or former smokers to relapse. Thus, this study aims to provide epidemiological evidence of the changes in smoking behavior among British smokers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the impact of psychosocial factors on these behaviors. A nationwide survey of a representative sample of 4075 UK respondents aged &gt;16 years was conducted between 27 April and 24 May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial and demographic variables between different smoking behavior groups were compared using Pearson's Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test and Cramer's V. Among current smokers (n=329), one-quarter (25.2%, n=86) reported smoking more than usual, 50.9% (n=174) reported smoking the same amount, and 20.2% (n=69) reported smoking less. Significant associations were observed between different smoking behavior groups and psychosocial factors. Pearson's Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test revealed significant differences between different smoking behavior groups in their concerns about mental health (p&lt;0.001), anxiety (p&lt;0.001) and stress (p&lt;0.001), state of low mood (p=0.012), in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) score (p=0.018) and ranking on the Cantril Ladder scale (p&lt;0.001). Many respondents expressed that the pandemic had a more negative impact on their mental health and the impact was more pronounced among those who smoked more. Deterioration of mental health and psychosocial well-being were linked to increased smoking. Public health authorities should take proactive measures to provide mental healthcare and smoking cessation support as preventive measures to tackle the pandemic.","Tzu-Hsuan Chen","https://doi.org/10.18332/tpc/126976","20201109","COVID-19; mental health; pandemics; psychosocial; smoking; tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6956,""
"Profile of distress callers and service utilisation of tele-counselling among the population of Assam, India: an exploratory study during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people globally by causing psychological, social, and economic chaos. The Assam Police, India started telephone helplines to address the psychological issues. To evaluate the sociodemographic profile of the distress callers, their psychosocial concerns, the interventions provided by the service provider, and whether the service users were satisfied with the intervention(s) or not. It was a cross-sectional study done during the period of lockdown (7-24 April 2020). All the callers who called the helpline were screened for anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts (when required), and the psychosocial issues which they were facing were explored. They were provided the psychological intervention(s) at the appropriate time, and they were asked to rate their experience at the end. A total of 239 callers used the tele-counselling services. The majority of callers were male (79.1%). Most of the callers were between 19-35 years of age group (66.5%), married (52.5%), and graduates (31%). Two-thirds of the callers called to seek guidance for their own issues and one-third for their relatives or friends. Callers had anxiety (46%), depressive disorder (8.3%), and depressive symptoms not qualifying for depressive disorder (14%), and suicidal thoughts (5.44%). The commonest intervention provided to the callers was supportive (77.8%), followed by psychoeducation (30.5%), cognitive behaviour therapy (24.7%), relaxation (23.6%) and behaviour therapy (13.4%).

"Psychiatric emergencies during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the suburban New York City area","This report characterizes patients presenting for psychiatric emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic and describes COVID-19-related stressors. Patients seen for emergency psychiatric evaluation during the height of the COVID-19 period (March 1-April 30, 2020; NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 201) were compared with those in the immediate Pre-COVID-19 period (January 1-February 28, 2020; NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 355), on sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, symptoms, and disposition. Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were compared with those that tested negative on the same outcomes. Prevalence and nature of COVID-19-stressors that influenced the emergency presentation were rated. The most common psychiatric diagnoses and presenting symptoms during both periods were depression and suicidal ideation. Comparing the Pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, a significant decline in emergency psychiatric volume was observed in children and adolescents (C/A), but not adults. COVID-19 period C/A patients had more new onset disorders and were more likely to be admitted to inpatient care, but were less likely to present with suicide attempts, impulse control disorders and agitation/aggression. Adults were more likely to have no access to outpatient care, present with anxiety disorders, and were also more likely to be admitted for inpatient care. COVID-19 directly affected the psychiatric emergency in 25% of patients, with the more severe stressors triggered by fear of COVID infection (including psychosis), actual COVID infection in self or family members, including death of a loved one.

"Prevalence of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder among COVID-19 patients: protocol for a living systematic review","Previous studies on the impact of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health of the patients has been limited by the lack of relevant data. With the rapid and sustained growth of the publications on COVID-19 research, we will perform a living systematic review (LSR) to provide comprehensive and continuously updated data to explore the prevalence of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 patients. We will perform a comprehensive search of the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature to identify relevant studies. We will include peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies published in English and Chinese. Two reviewers will independently assess the methodological quality of included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal tool and perform data extraction. In the absence of clinical heterogeneity, the prevalence estimates with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be calculated by using random-effects model to minimize the effect of between-study heterogeneity separately. The literature searches will be updated every 3 months. We will perform meta-analysis if any new eligible studies or data are obtained. We will resubmit an updated review when there were relevant changes in the results, i.e., when outcomes became statistically significant (or not statistically significant anymore) or when heterogeneity became substantial (or not substantial anymore). This LSR will provide an in-depth and up-to-date summary of whether the common neuropsychiatric conditions observed in patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are also prevalent in a different stage of COVID-19 patients.

"Psychosocial risk factors associated with mental health of adolescents amidst the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak","An outbreak of global pandemic COVID-19 profoundly affects life around the globe. Prolonged isolation, contact restriction and economic shutdown impose a deeply change to the psychosocial environment. These indicate a tendency to threaten the mental health of adolescents' significantly. Detecting adolescents' psychosocial risk during Pandemic COVID-19, particularly when they stay at home, may be helpful to better understand their mental health well- being. The current study aimed to explore psychosocial risk factors associated with mental health of adolescents' in the midst of the outbreak. This research uses a qualitative approach which focuses on focus group discussions interviews. This research took 6 weeks via online communication platform involving (<i>n</i> = 15) adolescents from the Low Income Household. The participants adolescents' psychosocial risk experience during amidst of Outbreak Covid-19 Pandemic are composed of (1) self- conflict (develop negative thought at home, unplanned of daily activities, changing sleep pattern and irregular wake up time and massively use internet) (2) Family Members (Conflict between parent and miscommunication between siblings) (3) School (Piling up on homework, Inadequate guidance for homework and Inability to comprehend online learning). These psychosocial risk factors have caused disruption to daily life adolescents' during outbreaks and almost inevitably trigger a spike in mental health issues. Overall of study emphasized that psychosocial risks are important factors that can be addressed in order to reduce mental health problem.","Amran","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020971008","20201107","COVID- 19; Psychosocial; adolescents; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6971,""
"Working in the Times of COVID-19 Psychological Impact of the Pandemic in Frontline Workers in Spain","This study evaluates the psychological impact (PI) of the COVID-19 pandemic in frontline workers in Spain. Participants were 546 workers (296 healthcare workers, 105 media professionals, 89 grocery workers, and 83 protective service workers). They all completed online questionnaires assessing PI, sadness, concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and demographic and work-related variables. All groups but protective services workers showed higher PI levels than the general population. Healthcare and grocery workers were the most affected, with 73.6% and 65.2% of the participants, respectively, showing a severe PI. Women showed a higher PI level. Healthcare workers in the regions with higher COVID-19 incidences reported greater PI levels. The main concerns were being infected by COVID-19 or infecting others. Levels of concern correlated with higher PI levels. The protection equipment was generally reported as insufficient, which correlated with higher PI levels. Professionals reporting to overwork during the crisis (60% mass-media, 38% of healthcare and grocery and 21.7% of protective service) showed higher PI levels. In the healthcare group, taking care of patients with COVID-19 (77%) or of dying patients with COVID-19 (43.9%) was associated with higher PI levels. The perceived social recognition of their work was inversely related to PI. Most of the sample had not received psychological support. We suggest some organizational measures for frontline institutions, such as the periodical monitoring or inclusion of psychologists specialized in crisis-management to prevent negative symptoms and provide timely support.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Rey, Garrido-Hernansaiz, Bueno-Guerra","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218149","20201109","COVID-19; Spain; depression; frontline workers; grocery store workers; healthcare providers; journalists; occupational health; pandemic; protective service workers; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6972,""
"Effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle promotion program as adjunctive teletherapy for treatment-resistant major depression during COVID 19 pandemic: A randomized clinical trial protocol","Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has a high prevalence and can be exacerbated by poor physical health and economic hardships, which have become common stressors during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The therapeutic approaches used to treat these patients are not always available, may be not be accepted by some patients, and often require face-to-face interactions. The main aim of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet-based adjuvant lifestyle-based intervention for patients with TRD. This will be a parallel, randomized, and controlled clinical trial. A total of 180 patients with TRD will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 groups: treatment prescribed by the mental health team and written suggestions for lifestyle changes (placebo control group); treatment prescribed by the mental health team, written suggestions for lifestyle changes, and an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program (active control group); or treatment prescribed by the mental health team, written suggestions for lifestyle changes, and an 8-week lifestyle change promotion program (intervention group). We will perform this study during the COVID-19 pandemic, and will administer interventions by teletherapy, and contact participants by telephone calls, text messages, and/or teleconferences. We will collect patient data using questionnaires administered at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome will be score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II. The secondary outcomes will be score on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (used to quantify and track patient progress and treatment response over time) and health-related quality of life measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire. Patients with TRD are especially vulnerable when face-to-face psychotherapy is unavailable. The main strength of the proposed study is the novelty of the intervention to be used as an adjuvant therapy. Our results may provide guidance for treatment of patients with TRD in future situations that require lockdown measures.

"Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic: People's experiences and satisfaction with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has rapidly been adopted to deliver healthcare services around the world. To date, research has not investigated how people's experience with telehealth services compare to traditional in-person visits during the pandemic in Australia. To determine how participants perceived telehealth consults in comparison to traditional in-person visits, and to investigate whether people believe that telehealth services would be useful beyond the pandemic. A national cross-sectional community survey was conducted between June 5th and June 12th in Australia. Participants aged 18 years and over and living in Australia were recruited via targeted advertisements on social media (Facebook and Instagram) (n=1369). Participants responded to survey questions about their telehealth experience, which included a free-text response option. A generalised linear model was used to estimate adjusted relative risks of having a poorer telehealth experience compared to traditional in-person visits. Content analysis was used to determine the reasons provided for why telehealth experiences were worse than traditional in-person visits. Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (62%) rated their telehealth experience as &quot;just as good&quot; or &quot;better&quot; than a traditional in-person medical appointment. On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic is over (M=3.67 out of 5, SD=1.1). Being male (p=0.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (p=0.037), or lower patient activation (individuals' willingness to take on the role of managing their health/healthcare) (p=0.037) were associated with a poorer telehealth experience. Six overarching themes were identified from free-text responses of why telehealth experience was poorer than a traditional in-person medical appointment: communication is not as effective; limitations with technology; issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology; reduced confidence in doctor; additional burden for complex care; and inability to be physically examined. Telehealth appointments were reported to be comparable to traditional in-person medical appointments by most of our sample. Telehealth may be worthwhile as mode of healthcare delivery while the pandemic continues and may be worthwhile beyond the pandemic.","Isautier, Copp, Ayre, Cvejic, Meyerowitz-Katz, Batcup, Bonner, Dodd, Nickel, Pickles, Cornell, Dakin, McCaffery","https://doi.org/10.2196/24531","20201106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6975,""
"Social Media Reveals Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Large-scale Quasi-Experimental Study","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multi-faceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a &quot;mental health tsunami,&quot; the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remains unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. Our work aims to provide insights regarding people's psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support expressions in the pandemic context. We obtain Ã¢Ë†Â¼60M Twitter streaming posts originating from the U.S. from 24 March-24 May 2020 and compare these with Ã¢Ë†Â¼40M posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people's social media self-disclosure. Using these datasets, we study people's self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We employ transfer learning classifiers that identify the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examine the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 datasets. We find that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis - mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by ~14%, and support expressions have increased by ~5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observe a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlight that people express concerns that are very specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people's mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their &quot;new normal&quot;. Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, healthcare and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This work shows the potential to provide insights to mental healthcare and stakeholders and policymakers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amidst the health crisis.","Saha, Torous, Caine, De Choudhury","https://doi.org/10.2196/22600","20201106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6976,""
"General Population Mental Health Surveillance System during the COVID-19 Epidemic in Saudi Arabia: A Nationwide Multi-Wave Survey","The COVID-19 period can potentially be categorized as a traumatic event. Public health surveillance is one of the cornerstones of public health practice and it empowers decision-makers to lead and manage public health crises and programs more effectively by providing timely, useful evidence. To identify, track, and monitor trends of the populations at risk of major depressive disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilizes continuous cross-sectional national level mental health screening via computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged 18 years and above, from Saudi Arabia, were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4,056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety; in addition, it collects data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. The study recruitment started in May 2020 and the final report is expected to be completed by the end of October 2020. The monitoring of population mental health status during the COVID-19 epidemic will inform decision-makers of any potential deterioration in mental health on a national level and among subgroups, including regions, age groups and gender groups. It will allow the decision makers to signal issues and intervene early. It will also provide valuable scientific data to help in understanding the effect of such epidemics on mental health, as it is as far as we know, the only study that attempts to monitor mental health status of the general population on a monthly basis.","BinDhim, Althumiri, Basyouni, Alageel, Alghnam, Al-Qunaibet, Almubarak, Aldhukair, Ad-Dabbagh","https://doi.org/10.2196/23748","20201106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6977,""

Participants were identified through participant-driven sampling along with flyer and text advertising (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 36). Research staff conducted audio-recorded in-depth interviews via telephone, assessing COVID-19 effects on substance use, mental health, and overdose risk. Transcribed interviewers were coded for themes using a semantic approach. Participants reported various mental health symptoms and experiences due to COVID-19, including increased feelings of boredom, loneliness, and depression; increased worry and stress; and increased suicidal ideation. Participants described varying impacts of COVID-19 on substance use. Overall, participants who used only methamphetamine reported decreased use and people who used only heroin or heroin with methamphetamine reported increased use. Most participants reported that they were not concerned about overdose and that COVID-19 did not impact their concerns about overdose, despite increases in risky use and suicidal ideations. As rural communities respond to the evolving impacts of COVID-19, there is increasing need to identify strategies to address PWUD's mental, physical, and social health needs during COVID-19.","Stack, Leichtling, Larsen, Gray, Pope, Leahy, Gelberg, Seaman, Korthuis","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000770","20201106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6978,""

We aim to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting utilization of recanalization procedures and numbers of patients with stroke and TIA admitted to a primary care stroke center. <b>Methods:</b> In this retrospective observational study, we compared patients admitted from January 2019 until February 2020 with patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic (March/April 2020) in Germany. We included patients with stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic) or TIA as classified by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems version 10 (ICD-10). <b>Results:</b> The number of patients per month with ischemic stroke or TIA was found to have significantly decreased from January 2019 until February 2020 compared to the COVID-19 pandemic (March/April 2020) (ischemic stroke 69.1 Ã‚Â± 4.5 vs. 55 Ã‚Â± 5.7, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, TIA 22.1 Ã‚Â± 4.1 vs. 14.5 Ã‚Â± 6.4, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.034).

"Effect of COVID-19 on delivery plans and postnatal depression scores of pregnant women","Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak Hong Kong hospitals have suspended visiting periods and made mask wearing mandatory. In obstetrics, companionship during childbirth has been suspended and prenatal exercises, antenatal talks, hospital tours, and postnatal classes have been cancelled. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of these restrictive measures on delivery plans and risks of postpartum depression. We compared pregnancy data and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of women who delivered between the pre-alert period (1 Jan 2019 to 4 Jan 2020) and post-alert period (5 Jan 2020 to 30 Apr 2020) in a tertiary university public hospital in Hong Kong. Screening for postpartum depression was performed routinely using the EPDS questionnaire 1 day and within 1 week after delivery. There was a 13.1% reduction in the number of deliveries between 1 January and 30 April from 1144 in 2019 to 994 in 2020. The EPDS scores were available for 4357 out of 4531 deliveries (96.2%). A significantly higher proportion of women had EPDS scores of Ã¢â€°Â¥10 1 day after delivery in the post-alert group than the pre-alert group (14.4% vs 11.9%; P&lt;0.05). More women used pethidine (6.2% vs 4.6%) and fewer used a birthing ball (8.5% vs 12.4%) for pain relief during labour in the post-alert group. Pregnant women reported more depressive symptoms in the postpartum period following the alert announcement regarding coronavirus infection in Hong Kong. This was coupled with a drop in the delivery rate at our public hospital.

"Bundled interventions for consumption management and monitoring of personal protective equipment in COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong local hospitals","Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, there had been global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) supply due to the breakage of supply chain and also the forbidding of PPE exported by various countries. This situation had greatly affected the healthcare services in local hospitals of Hong Kong. To maintain the availability of PPE for healthcare workers in high-risk clinical settings, the cluster management of New Territories West Cluster, Hospital Authority, had implemented a bundle of interventions in controlling and managing the PPE consumption and ensuring its proper use. A Taskforce on Management of PPE was set up in February 2020 with the aim to monitor and manage the use of PPE in five local hospitals and eight general outpatient clinics of New Territories West Cluster, which were governed in a cluster basis, under the COVID-19 epidemic. Interventions including cutting down non-essential services, implementing telecare, monitoring PPE consumption at unit level and PPE stock at the Cluster Central Distribution Centre and forming mobile infection teams were implemented. The updated PPE standards and usage guidelines to clinical staff were promulgated through forums, newsletters and unit visits. The PPE consumption rates of individual unit were reviewed. Significant decrease in PPE consumption rates was noted when comparing with the baseline data. Comparing the data between 20 February and 1 June 2020, the overall PPE consumption rates were reduced by 64% (r=-0.841; p&lt;0.001) while the PPE consumption rates in anaesthesia and operating theatres, and isolation and surveillance wards were reduced by 47% (r=-0.506; p=0.023) and 49% (r=-0.810; p&lt;0.001), respectively.

"The Food Bank of Madrid: A Linear Model for Optimal Nutrition","This work proposes a mathematical linear programming model that addresses the food provisioning problem of the food bank of Madrid. It aims to determine the most appropriate weekly decisions to meet the macro-nutritional requirements of the beneficiaries of this social service, by minimizing the total cost considering third-party donations. The model has been applied to a realistic case study considering a sociological structure of beneficiaries categorized by age and gender and representing the first decile of incomes of the Spanish population. The demand of macronutrients is satisfied by means of nine different groups of food, used to provide some level of variability in the consumption patterns of the beneficiaries. The results provide insight on cost-cutting opportunities related to centralizing the decision-making process, indicating a 10% reduction both in provisioning costs and food quantities. This suggests that the proposed model might serve as a tool for designing new strategies for the provisioning or evaluation of economic and social support policies for the food bank of Madrid.","CastaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³n, Campos, DomÃƒÂ©nech MartÃƒÂ­nez, Villar","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218097","20201106","COVID-19 pandemic; food bank; nutrition economics; nutrition in low-income scenarios; resource optimization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6984,""
"Patient and provider perspectives of a new prenatal care model introduced in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","Randomized controlled trials document the safety and efficacy of reduced frequency prenatal visit schedules and virtual visits, but real-world data are lacking. Our institution created a prenatal care delivery model incorporating these alternative approaches to continue safely providing prenatal care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To evaluate institutional-level adoption and patient and provider experiences with the coronavirus disease 2019 prenatal care model. We conducted a single-site evaluation of a coronavirus disease 2019 prenatal care model incorporating a reduced frequency visit schedule and virtual visits deployed at a suburban academic institution on March 20, 2020. We used electronic health record data to evaluate institution-level model adoption, defined as changes in overall visit frequency and proportion of virtual visits in the 3 months before and after implementation. To evaluate the patient and provider experience with the coronavirus disease 2019 model, we conducted an online survey of all pregnant patients (&gt;20 weeks' gestation) and providers in May 2020. Of note, 3 domains of care experience were evaluated: (1) access, (2) quality and safety, and (3) satisfaction. Quantitative data were analyzed with basic descriptive statistics. Free-text responses coded by the 3 survey domains elucidated drivers of positive and negative care experiences. After the coronavirus disease 2019 model adoption, average weekly prenatal visit volume fell by 16.1%, from 898 to 761 weekly visits; the average weekly proportion of prenatal visits conducted virtually increased from 10.8% (97 of 898) to 43.3% (330 of 761); and the average visit no-show rate remained stable (preimplementation, 4.3%; postimplementation, 4.2%). Of those eligible, 74.8% of providers (77 of 103) and 15.0% of patients (253 of 1690) participated in the surveys. Patient respondents were largely white (180 of 253; 71.1%) and privately insured (199 of 253; 78.7%), reflecting the study site population. The rates of chronic conditions and pregnancy complications also differed from national prevalence. Provider respondents were predominantly white (44 of 66; 66.7%) and female (50 of 66; 75.8%). Most patients and almost all providers reported that virtual visits improved access to care (patients, 174 of 253 [68.8%]; providers, 74 of 77 [96.1%]). More than half of respondents (patients, 124 of 253 [53.3%]; providers, 41 of 77 [62.1%]) believed that virtual visits were safe. Nearly all believed that home blood pressure cuffs were important for virtual visits (patients, 213 of 231 [92.2%]; providers, 63 of 66 [95.5%]). Most reported satisfaction with the coronavirus disease 2019 model (patients, 196 of 253 [77.5%]; providers, 64 of 77 [83.1%]). In free-text responses, drivers of positive care experiences were similar for patients and providers and included perceived improved access to care through decreased barriers (eg, transportation, childcare), perceived high quality of virtual visits for low-risk patients and increased safety during the pandemic, and improved satisfaction through better patient counseling. Perceived drivers of negative care experience were also similar for patients and providers, but less common. These included concerns that unequal access to virtual visits could deepen existing maternity care inequities, concerns that the lack of home devices (eg, blood pressure cuffs) would affect care quality and safety, and dissatisfaction with poor patient-provider continuity and inadequate expectation setting for the virtual visit experience. Reduced visit schedules and virtual visits were rapidly integrated into real-world care, with positive experiences for many patients and providers. Future research is needed to understand the health outcomes and care experience associated with alternative approaches to prenatal care delivery across more diverse patient populations outside of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic to inform broader health policy decisions.","Peahl, Powell, Berlin, Smith, Krans, Waljee, Dalton, Heisler, Moniz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.10.008","20201108","antenatal care; care delivery; coronavirus disease 2019; gestational diabetes mellitus screening; patient-centered care; postpartum care; prenatal care; telemedicine; ultrasound; vaccination; virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6985,""
"THE SOONER THE BETTER? ANXIETY AND DELIBERATE EXPOSURE TO COVID-19 RISK AMONG YOUNG ADULTS IN FRANCE","The COVID-19 outbreak has generated significant uncertainty about the future, especially for young adults. Health and economic threats, as well as more diffuse concerns about the consequences of COVID-19, can trigger feelings of anxiety, leading individuals to adopt uncertainty-reducing behaviours. We tested whether anxiety was associated with an increase in willingness to be exposed to the risk of COVID-19 infection (WiRE) using an online survey administered to 3,110 French individuals aged between 18 and 35 years old during the lockdown period (April 2020). Overall, 56.5% of the sample declared a positive WiRE. Unemployment was associated with a higher WiRE (+8.2 percentage points (pp); 95% CI +0.9-15.4 pp). One standard deviation increases in income (+1160â‚¬) and psychological state anxiety raised the WiRE by +2.7 pp (95% CI: +1.1-4.4 pp) and +3.9 pp (95% CI: +1.6-6.2 pp), respectively. A one standard deviation increase in perceived hospitalisation risk was associated with a -4.1 pp (95% CI: -6.2-2.1 pp) decrease in the WiRE. Overall, our results suggest that both the prospect of economic losses and psychological anxiety can undermine young adultsâ€™ adherence to physical distancing recommendations. Public policies targeting young adults must consider both their economic situation and their mental health, and they must use uncertainty-reducing communication strategies.","Fabrice EtilÃ© et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46097-1C5-45A","20201110","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; social values; anxiety; contamination; self-protection effort; covid-19; risk exposure","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6986,""
"Palestinian Attitudes Towards Settlers in the West Bank","We present survey data from 1,573 West Bank Palestinians with which we estimate that the average Palestinian lives 14 km (UI 11 to 18 km) from the closest Israeli settlement. We also show with this data that while Palestinians in general hold negative attitudes towards settlers in the West Bank, Palestinians living in closer proximity to a settlement report more neutral attitudes towards settlers. Multivariate analysis shows that this effect appears to be driven by social and professional contact: Palestinians who have interacted with a settler or worked in a settlement present more positive attitudes towards settlers while distance loses its ability to predict attitudes. Since the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the majority of respondents stated that they have lost either a job or a business from COVID-related restrictions, suggesting that this positive contact effect could dissipate as Palestinians have less reason to interact with Israelis.","Tesea Conte Thornton et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-8D8-670","20201110","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics; contact hypothesis; occupation; palestine; west bank","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-10","",6987,""
