"The Association of Socioeconomic Status, the Concern for Catching Covid-19, and Anxiety Between Individuals with and without a Cancer History from a Cross-sectional Study","Background: COVID-19 has negative impacts on mental health in all populations. Individuals with a history of cancer have an increased risk of catching and having more severe symptoms of COVID-19 than the general public. The objective of this study was to examine how cancer history and concern for catching COVID-19 relate to anxiety.<br /><br />Methods: This cross-sectional study is part of the ""Impact of COVID-19 on Behaviors across the Cancer Control Continuum in Ohio"" project conducted from June to November 2020. The sample consisted of 7012 participants who completed survey online, by phone, or by mail. Self-reported concern for catching COVID-19 and anxiety over the last 7 days were used. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between demographics, cancer history, concern for catching COVID-19, and anxiety.<br /><br />Results: In our study sample, most participants rated their concern for catching COVID- 19 as moderately high or high (56%) and reported anxiety for one day or more (63%). Individuals with a cancer history were more likely to report moderate-high or high concern for catching COVID-19 (59% vs.54%, P<0.001) but less likely to report anxiety (58% vs. 67%, P<0.001) compared to those without a cancer history. Individuals with higher SES were less likely to report anxiety (middle vs. low SES: OR=0.68, 95%CI=0.59-0.79; high vs. low SES: OR=0.70, 95%CI=0.61-0.82). Additionally, increased concern for catching COVID-19 was associated with higher likelihood of reporting anxiety (moderate-low vs. low: OR=1.65, 95%CI=1.42-1.92; moderate-high vs. low: OR=2.98, 95%CI=2.53-3.50; high vs. low: OR=4.35, 95%CI=3.74-5.07).<br /><br />Conclusions: Our findings suggest individuals with a cancer history reported higher concern for catching COVID-19. Higher concern for catching COVID was associated with anxiety. These findings indicate that healthcare providers should pay special attention to the different populations to reduce concerns for catching COVID-19 and provide strategies to improve mental health during a pandemic outbreak.<br />

Materials and Methods: Patients who had applied to our faculty before the pandemic and were reached via teledentistry were included. A questionnaire consisting of 4 sections and 25 questions was administered through telephone conversation. Demographic information, medical history, smoking habits, and COVID-19 history (with [COVID(+)] or without COVID-19 [COVID(-)]) were questioned in the first section, while dental hygiene (DH), environmental dental hygiene (EH), history of periodontal disease (PH) were evaluated in the next three sections. The answers were scored in a way that increased values symbolize negative attitude.

"Estado emocional de cuidadores y de niÃ±os preescolares: antes y durante la cuarentena por COVID-19","At present it is going through a global pandemic that forced the human being to adopt different ways of relating and doing their daily tasks, for that reason we wanted to make a comparison of the depressive symptoms of caregivers, the perception of the function family and internalized and externalized problems in children aged two to five years, in three groups interviewed at three times: 1) before quarantine by COVID-19 in Colombia, 2) during the first three weeks of quarantine and 3 ) from the fourth to the sixth week of quarantine. The questionnaires used measured: sociodemographic characteristics, the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on the lives of individuals, the perception of family-function, depressive symptoms of caregivers, and the behavior and emotional state of children. Aggressive behavior (Mean = 8,79;p = 0,000), anxiety (3,85;p = 0,025) and attention problems (2,53;p = 0,023) were found to be higher in the third group studied.

"MEDIA USE AND LOCKDOWNS: NAVIGATING EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL STATES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","This study examined the psychological and behavioural impact of media use and trust on mental states and behaviour. We examined the effects of both traditional and new media, and included the effects on social and psychological states associated with a lockdown. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 339 participants. Media use, government and scientific trust, conflict and compliance, as well as a range of emotional and mental states were examined. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Results reveal that use of traditional media, rather than new media, was significantly associated with fear of Covid-19. Among social media, only Facebook use had a significant negative relationship with psychosocial negativity. Compliance with preventive measures was predicted only by trust in science. Higher trust in government was related to lower levels of fear and psychosocial negativity, which, in turn, were positively associated with depression. The results demonstrate that different media can alleviate or exacerbate negative emotions and it is important to discern their effects. They also show how social and psychological states during homPe confinement may further impact mental health and affect interpersonal relationships.

"Social isolation and post-COVID neuropsychological damage","Social isolation (SI) exerts a harmful effect on brain plasticity even in healthy animals and humans. We reported some new connections between aggressive behavior and SI, and new mechanisms of SI damaging effect on experimental rodents in previous studies. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurotropism through its affinity for the ACE2 receptor in endothelial cells found in the brain. The neurotropism in the disease caused by the new coronavirus accords with a wide spectrum of neurological, psychiatric and psychological symptoms. It had been reported that up to almost 43% of SARS survivors developed long-lasting psychiatric morbidity that persisted at 4 years follow up with main diagnoses in diminishing order of representation: posttraumatic stress disorders, depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Full assessment of the long-term risk of neurological and psychological complications will be greatly needed once the coronavirus pandemic is over. Based on current data and the reported experience with SARS-CoV we hypothesize that the neurobehavioral sequelae of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 will necessitate close interaction between emergency medicine and psychological support. The role of social support for the restoration of post-Covid neuropsychological damage is essential because the human being is not only a biological object but also a social subject who needs support from other humans.","Encheva-Stoykova, E.; Tancheva, L.; Kalfin, R.","https://doi.org/10.15547/tjs.2022.01.010","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Trakia Journal of Sciences; 20(1):65-73, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35343,""

"Non-medical prescribing considerations in emergency mental health services","The emergency mental health practitioner's job involves providing immediate care to patients who are suffering a mental health crisis. Independent nurse prescribing supports this service through timely access to pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures or cognitive behavioural strategies. This case study involves a service user diagnosed with bipolar type II disorder who presents with suicidal ideation, and outlines the prescribing options available for short-term crises and long-term risk management. There is a complex balance of appraising physical and mental health including capacity, assessment of risk of self-harm and harm to others, and working in consultation to optimise adherence and concordance. The authors highlight the importance of using a person-centred approach, which includes family, carers and their wider support network, to develop a therapeutic relationship which promotes positive outcomes.

"Key success factors for scaling social enterprises in South Africa","Governments rely increasingly on social partners for assistance to deliver on UNESCOâ€™s sustainable development goals by 2030. However, community organisations are buckling under socio-economic hardship and a lack of donor funding during a global Covid-19 pandemic. Many social enterprises (SEs) are faced with the reality of cutting back or in some instances, completely shutting down their operations. An investigation of the literature revealed a high rate of early-stage business failure in South Africa. Hence our investigation into the key success factors that will aid SEs to scale and thrive in the hostile South African socio-political and economic climate. Using a qualitative, single case study approach underpinned by an interpretivist philosophy, this paper investigates the critical success factors for scaling SEs in South Africa. Three (3) semi-structured interviews, website content analysis and observations were used in the study to deliver data that was thematically analysed to come to the following results: SEs must express the ambition to scale, provide a best practice model, and have a social entrepreneurship orientation. Grassroots SEs must create access for local communities by focusing on three organisational dimensions, i.e., personal, operational, and strategic. Community partnerships are an overarching factor when considering scaling GSEs. By forming a social contract with communities, SEs allow them to take ownership of the interventions, increasing social impact. This paper adds to the existing knowledge regarding the critical success factors that enable the scaling of SEs in South Africa. It also creates a frame of reference for grassroots SEs in other developing countries.","Henry Oswald, Esau, Tengeh, Robertson K.","https://doi.org/10.9770/jesi2022.9.4(21)","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues; 9(4):396-415, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35346,""
"Strengthening of student youth's mental health using play sports","The purpose of the article is to theoretically substantiate and empirically establish that health-preserving technologies, such as play sports, may improve the mental health of student youth. Respondents were first-year students who, on their initiative, participated in a university program to implement health technologies, regularly attending sectional trainings in play sports (males - football;females - volleyball). The ascertaining stage of the experimental study was attended by n = 122 respondents aged 18 to 20 years (M = 18.6), and the formative stage was attended by n = 72 respondents. Football EGF (n = 24) and volleyball EGV (n = 12) were formed as experimental groups, and football CGF (n = 24) and volleyball CGV (n = 12) as control groups. Research methods: analysis, generalization;targeted observation using data recording protocols;valid methods with standard questionnaires. Results. It was revealed that respondents' psychological well-being (PW), which was measured in the coordinates of positive self-esteem (.227;p=01), the general mood background (.321;p=01) and the life satisfaction index (.301;p=01), was a predictor of mental health. Psychological well-being (PW) was shown to have the greatest statistically significant correlation (p=05;p=01) with the self-regulation and life satisfaction characteristics of student youth. The parameters ""Self-acceptance"" (p&lt;01), ""Psychological well-being"" (p&lt;01), ""Life Satisfaction Index"" (p&lt;01), ""Evaluation of Performance"" (p&lt;01), ""Integral Level of Self-Regulation"" (p&lt;01) showed positive significant changes in both experimental groups (EGF - football, EGV - volleyball). It is emphasized that positive changes in students' self-perception of themselves are, in our opinion, the most important positive changes that affect the general mood (.223;p&lt;01) and is one of the most important parameters of mental health of respondents. Conclusions. It is generalized that regular training and competitions of student youth in football (males) and volleyball (females) during the academic year, contribute to statistically significant changes in mental health parameters. The implemented practice is an effective health-preserving technology that should be applied in college and higher education institutions' instructional processes.","Popovych, Ihor, Hoi, Nataliia, Koval, Iryna, Vorobel, Mariia, Semenov, Oleksandr, Semenova, Nataliia, Hrys, Antonina","https://doi.org/10.7752/jpes.2022.06174","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Physical Education and Sport; 22(6):1384-1395, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35347,""

In Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust one such change has been the development of a community enhanced rehabilitation team, to support service users who had experienced quicker discharge from inpatient rehabilitation services due to pandemic-related measures with transition into the community. This article reports the findings of a service evaluation which explored the experiences of service users and staff after the team had been operational for 12 months. Six service users and five staff members participated in individual semi-structured interviews which, following thematic analysis, generated seven themes: developing staff competency;doing 'proper rehab work';managing anxiety and crisis;good teamwork;mode of working;joining up the pathway;and ideas for the future. The service evaluation supports the continued use of small caseloads to maintain effective rehabilitation care. Further work is required to ensure smooth transition between inpatient and community rehabilitation services.","Kidd, Katherine, Fenton, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.7748/mhp.2022.e1593","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mental Health Practice; 25(4):27-34, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35348,""

"Home-based telemental health services for Indian patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparison with the pre-COVID phase","Background: Many developed countries have switched from conventional outpatient psychiatric services to tele mental health-based alternatives because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, similar transitions might be difficult for countries like India because of a shortage of necessary resources. Therefore, the feasibility and acceptability of converting to a home-based tele mental health (HB-TMH) service during the pandemic were examined in an Indian hospital. Materials and Methods: A new and expanded version of an HB-TMH service was operated for all outpatients following the onset of the pandemic. Feasibility outcomes included operational viability, service utilization, service engagement, the need for additional in-person services, and the frequency of adverse events. Patients' and clinicians' satisfaction with different aspects of the service were evaluated using Likert-style questionnaires to ascertain acceptability.

"Impact of lockdown and psychological first aid: A case study","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown declared by the Indian Government in March 2020 lead to an unexpected turn of events for many, causing a huge psychosocial impact on them. Methodology: The study focused on evaluating a family from Kerala with major language difficulties and the distress being faced by them during their stay in the government provided shelter home in Delhi. The family was assessed by the multidisciplinary team from the Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences visiting various shelter homes across the state. The study was aimed to assess the importance of psychological first aid (PFA) on the individual and the family in distress. Results: The family was assessed by the student counselor, who was well versed in their native language Malayalam. They were able to connect well, and hence, an appropriate psychosocial intervention was provided to them under the guidance of her supervisor. The family was highly distressed and had almost developed xenophobia. They were very happy to get a Malayalam-speaking counselor and were provided with all possible support. The authorities were also explained about their specific needs, which was not possible earlier due to the language barrier. They were ultimately successfully integrated with the other residents and returned to their home state, i.e., Kerala. Conclusion: Although PFA is definitely not a substitute for mental health care, ample research and experience has shown that it is a useful tool to assist people in acute distress when applied with a truly professional yet sensitive, empathetic approach.","Varma, Ruchi, Yannawar, Pravin, Antony, Reshma","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijsp.ijsp_446_20","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Social Psychiatry; 38(2):205-208, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35355,""

Methodology: Our aim was to understand lived experiences of physicians who recovered from COVID-19 by focusing on mental health and psycho-social protective factors through a qualitative study using a narrative approach. A semi-structured questionnaire was outlined referring to literature and seeking experts' opinions. Telephonic interviews were conducted after fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and narratives were written and interpreted. Results: Mental health concerns identified from the narratives of five physicians are fear of infecting others, feeling guilty of transmitting infection, stigma, loneliness, and worry about complications after recovery. Social support, faith in a higher power, sense of purpose, and resilience were their sources of strength. Conclusion: Given the vulnerability and professional commitment to serve people, there is an urgent need to address their mental health needs.

"Rolling with the flow: Online faculty and student presence in a post-COVID-19 world","COVID-19 created a paradigm shift in higher education (HE), speeding up a process that was already underway and forcing institutions and instructors to develop the competencies necessary to offer effective delivery and resources online. Student reflections on Spring 2020 suggested that institutions were not always successful in their transitions. Students saw gaps in crucial areas, including online instructor presence, social presence for instructors and peers, and instructor immediacy. The purpose of this chapter is to propose best practices for instructional practice and technology in the online virtual education space to increase student engagement, instructor immediacy, and online social presence. HE institutions must embrace or enhance a variety of techniques that will improve the student experience. HE continues its shift toward cutting-edge technology to scale, streamline, and improve student engagement and interaction while creating new ways of establishing instructor presence and immediacy.

Men completed the Self-Report Questionnaire-20, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, the Two-Way Social Support Scale, and a sociodemographic questionnaire. In addition, a t-Test and a regression analysis were performed. Men in the clinical group reported significantly higher levels of IU and lower levels of SS. Furthermore, SS moderated the relationship between IU and CMD, suggesting that SS might help protect men's mental health against the deleterious effects of IU in a pandemic scenario.

"Post COVID syndrome: a novel challenge and threat to international health","The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has affected every continent worldwide. The novelty of this virus, its mutations and the rapid speed and unprecedented rate at which it has torn through the global community has in turn lead to an innate lack of knowledge and information about the actual disease caused and the severity of the complications associated with COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been infecting individuals since 2019 and now as of 2022 has been circulating for just over 2 years within the global populous. As the number of cases have risen globally over this period (some of which having contracted the virus twice) further endeavours have been undertaken to better understand the pathogenesis and natural progression of the disease. A condition reported in some cases with extended bouts of sickness or symptoms following the initial infection with COVID was labelled ""long COVID"" towards the earlier phases of the pandemic (in the spring of 2020), but has only recently gained the global media and medical attention due to its affliction of more individuals on a global basis and has thus warranted further investigation. Long COVID is described as a persistent, long-term state of poor health following an infection with COVID-19. The effect of Long COVID is multisystemic in nature with a wide array of signs and symptoms. The most commonly reported clinical features of long COVID are: headaches, myalgia, chest pain, rashes, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, anosmia, persistent cough, brain fogs, forgetfulness, depression, insomnia, fatigue and anxiety. This research aims to explore the symptomatology, pathophysiology as well as the treatment and prevention of Long COVID.","Banerjee, I.; Robinson, J.; Leclezio, A.; Sathian, B.; Indraneel, Banerjee","https://doi.org/10.3126/nje.v12i2.46149","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nepal Journal of Epidemiology; 12(2):1215-1219, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35361,""
"Time to Have Effective Regulation of the Mental Health Apps Market: Maximize Gains and Minimize Harms","The increased levels of psychological distress in the population and the disruption of traditional mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic have widened the mental health treatment gap that already existed even prior to the onset of the pandemic.[2] Additionally, there is significant stigma attached to mental-health-treatment seeking, especially in low- and middle-income countries.[3] The culmination of these different factors has provided a fertile ground for the mushrooming of mobile health apps for mental health disorders and wellbeing.[4] People advocating the use of mental health apps (MHapps) often describe the potential of these apps in delivering mental health services discretely to people living in even remote and rural locations, in turn reducing the huge mental health treatment gap. Rapidly increasing smartphone ownership among the majority of the world's population and increasing internet penetration through relatively cheaper mobile data usage plans have led to the development and popularization of various mobile applications (apps).[1] These apps are third-party software apps that utilize mobile and/or other related devices' hardware (e.g., wearable sensors, such as a smartwatch) along with or without internet communication technology and enable users to perform a wide range of different tasks related to varied fields, such as trade, commerce, education, entertainment, or health, through their smartphones.

"Primary care experiences of providing mental healthcare for children in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","BackgroundThe increased demand for mental healthcare associated with the COVID-19 pandemic adds to the already high unmet mental health needs among paediatric patients, resulting in a declared â€˜mental health emergencyâ€™. The study objective was to describe paediatric primary care providers (PCPsâ€™) experience of meeting their patientsâ€™ needs for mental healthcare during the pandemic and to identify opportunities to optimise care.Methods19 paediatricians and 2 nurse practitioners completed a 30 min video interview in May 2021. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and transcripts were analysed using consensual qualitative research methods.ResultsParticipants reported marked increases in patient mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included new diagnoses of anxiety and depression and increased treatment needs for patients with a prior mental health diagnosis. They identified that the mental health needs of their patients were greater, more severe and more challenging to manage with the resources currently available. While they were frustrated with the lack of communication and support from their mental health colleagues, and felt isolated and overwhelmed, they approached the increased demand for mental healthcare with a growth mindset. This outlook included providing care, seeking help to improve their skills and engaging with local resources such as the Child Psychiatry Access Project (CPAP).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that urgent action is needed to better support paediatric PCPs to provide mental healthcare in our community. Providers identified an ongoing need for timely access to and effective communication with mental health providers to guide care in the medical home. This need could be addressed immediately by providing training for new and experienced clinicians, expanding the scope of CPAP programmes to include patient assessment and supporting implementation of integrated behavioural health programmes into the medical home.","Garbutt, Jane, Dodd, Sherry, Rook, Shannon, Ericson, Lauren, Sterkel, Randall, Plax, Katie","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001497","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 6(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35363,""

"Support and Aid to Families Electronically (SAFE): Addressing Intersecting Academic and Community Needs","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools from elementary to post-secondary suddenly shifted to remote learning, placing a heavy burden on parents and caregivers. Likewise, social work practicum placements pivoted to remote learning, compounding existing difficulties securing practicum opportunities. This article describes a response to these challenges. The Support and Aid to Families Electronically (SAFE) practicum pilot program was developed through a community-university partnership between the Kingâ€™s University College at Western Universityâ€™s School of Social Work and the Thames Valley District School Board. SAFE addresses parental stress and mental health through free and immediate online counselling, while providing stable remote practicum placements. SAFE provides a model for increasing practicum opportunities while simultaneously supporting the needs of underserviced communities.

"United States Dental Health Care Workers' Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and understand factors influencing mental health among dental health care workers (DHCWs) in the United States (US) during the COVID-19 pandemic.<b>Methods:</b> Beginning in June 2020, dentists (DDS) and dental hygienists (DH) in the US were invited to participate monthly in an anonymous, longitudinal, web-based survey. The Patient Health Questionaire-4 (PHQ-4) was used to estimate rates of anxiety and depression symptoms. Changes in mental health over time and differences by demographic and practice characteristics, COVID-19 community transmission level and COVID-19 vaccination status were tested using Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests and multilevel multivariable logistic regression.<b>Results:</b> A total of 8,902 DHCWs (DH, DDS) participated in the survey for a response rate of 6.7%. Anxiety symptom rates peaked in November 2020 (28% DH; 17% DDS) and declined to 12% for both professions in May 2021. Depression symptoms were highest in December 2020 (17% DH; 10% DDS) and declined to 8% in May 2021. Controlling for gender, age, race, ethnicity and community COVID-19 transmission levels, DDS respondents had lower odds of anxiety symptoms (aOR 0.82; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.95) and depression symptoms (aOR 0.79; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.93) than DHs. Compared to vaccinated respondents, DHCWs who were unvaccinated but were planning on getting vaccinated had significantly higher rates of anxiety (aOR 1.71; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.44) and depression symptoms (aOR 1.57; CI 1.07 to 2.29).<b>Conclusions:</b> The mental health status of DHCWs fluctuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety and depression were associated with the demographic and professional characteristics of the DHCW as well as the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Mental health support should be made available for all DHCWs.","Eldridge, Estrich, Gurenlian, Battrell, Lynch, Vujicic, Morrissey, Dershewitz, Geisinger, Araujo","https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Dental+Health+Care+Workers'+Mental+Health+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20220729","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; health care worker; longitudinal study; mental health; professional role","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35371,""
"Stability of resilience in times of the COVID-19 pandemic","There is disagreement among researchers regarding the conceptualization of resilience as a dynamic state or stable trait. Aiming to shed light on the state-versus-trait debate, we explored the stability and construct validity of four of the most frequently utilized state or trait resilience scales in a longitudinal assessment. Additionally, we examined the predictive validity of these scales. Our study was conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which served as collectively experienced adversity. Correlations among the resilience scales and among resilience scales and Big Five personality traits were strong. All except one scale showed high test-retest correlations. Experience of an additional critical life event during the pandemic led to an increase in resilience. Other than in cross-sectional studies, associations between resilience and psychological distress were weak, because personality and baseline psychological distress were controlled for. Nevertheless, next to personality, resilience explained additional variance in distress change. Our results show relatively high stability of resilience overall. Yet, they also confirm dynamic resilience features, suggesting that resilience change occurs with significant adversity, leading to improved adaptation. To gauge the true association between resilience and mental health, baseline levels of these variables as well as personality traits should be considered.","KÃƒÂ¶hne, Engert, Rosendahl","https://doi.org/10.1002/pmh.1560","20220729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35372,""
"Interventions to Reduce Nurses' Moral Distress in the Intensive Care Unit: An Integrative Review","Critical care nurses experience moral distress, the phenomenon of knowing the ""right"" thing to do but being unable to do so, at high rates; this contributes to attrition and has severe mental health impacts on nurses. The purpose of this integrative review was to determine if interventions to reduce moral distress have an effect on intensive care unit (ICU) nurses' moral distress levels. Three databases were searched, PubMed, APA PsycNet, and CINAHL, using the keywords ""moral distress"" AND nurs* AND reduc* AND (""intensive care"" OR ""critical care"" OR ICU). Only experimental studies involving adult ICU nurses were included for a total of 6 studies. Interventions fell into 3 categories: (1) educational interventions, (2) interventions to enhance the ICU environment, and (3) interventions to help nurses cope. Two studies detailing educational interventions demonstrated some reduction in moral distress. One study aimed to improve the ICU environment and showed some statistically significant reduction in moral distress. All 6 studies included some focus on coping, and 2 showed statistically significant reductions in moral distress. Only a few studies have been conducted examining this issue. These studies had severe limitations, such as small sample sizes, attrition, and inadequate control groups. There were also few statistically significant results. These interventions should be reexamined using larger sample sizes, and other interventions should also be trialed. COVID-19 may have had a significant impact on this issue, and interventions may need to be refocused in the wake of the pandemic.","Hickey","https://doi.org/10.1097/DCC.0000000000000542","20220729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35373,""
"Quality of Life of Pediatric Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Study","In a public health emergency, the psychological stress of nursing staff should be assessed, and nurses who cared for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were constantly under pressure. Currently, frontline health care workers are experiencing mental health issues. The personal quality of life is directly related to the working environment, especially at this moment, when nursing could be a highly stressful and emotionally draining job. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary objectives of the study were to describe the quality of life, posttraumatic stress disorder, and self-efficacy and to identify any associated factors of pediatric critical care nurses. This study is a multicenter cross-sectional study. Data were collected between February and May 2021 from pediatric critical care nurses. The following instruments were used: the Nursing Quality of Life Scale, the Nursing Profession Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Impact of Event Scale. One hundred twelve nurses participated in this study with a 40% of response rate. Data suggest a better global perception of quality of life by male subjects (F = 6.65, P = .011). The nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients reported a lower quality of social life (F = 4.09, P = .045); furthermore, the nurses who had clinically vulnerable people in their families reported a worse quality of physical life (F = 4.37, P = .045). Approximately 50% of nurses reported sleep disturbances, and 37% reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, especially female nurses (F = 8.55, P = .04). According to this study, female nurses were more likely to experience posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, findings also highlighted a lower quality of social life for those with clinically vulnerable relatives may be due to a self-limitation of interactions with other people. Finally, sleep disturbances were prevalent, potentially affecting nurses' mental health and performance.","Buccione, Santella, Fiani, Maffeo, Tedesco, D'Errico, Della Pelle, Bambi, Rasero","https://doi.org/10.1097/DCC.0000000000000537","20220729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35374,""

"Factors associated with resilience among children and youths with disability during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is evidence of negative impact of social distancing and confinement measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic on children, including increased anxiety and depression and behaviour difficulties. Paradoxically, positive impacts like increased support and more self-care activities have also been documented. Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the children with disability and the potential role of familial, environmental, and biological factors on mitigating this impact. The aims of the study were 1) identifying profiles of functioning across multiple domains during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) examining the extent to which parenting self-efficacy, support in accessing schooling, and type of diagnosis predict the likelihood of resilience among children with disability, after controlling for household income and single-parent status. An online survey developed from COVID-19 guidance recommendations, was available from June 11- July 21, 2020, and resulted in a convenience sample of caregivers across Canada (n = 883) of children with disability (mean age of 9.4 years old, SDage = 5.7, 58% male). We conducted latent class analysis to examine the number of latent profiles on caregiver-reported changes of 12 functioning domains, as either 'worsening', 'no change', or 'improving'. Most participants belonged to 'stable' or 'worsening' profiles. However, we identified a small subgroup with improvements in child functioning, a pattern indicative of a 'resilient' profile. Using a multinomial logistic regression, we found that diagnosis type, parenting self-efficacy and support in accessing schooling were associated with membership in the Resilient or Stable profiles compared to the Worsening profile, after controlling for single-parent status and income. Taken together, our findings identified variability in responses to adversity that is dependent on the child's diagnosis type, parenting self-efficacy, and support in accessing schooling. By identifying potentially modifiable predictors of resilience, namely parenting self-efficacy and support in accessing schooling, we signal the potential for tailored supports for different diagnoses, through interventions that enhance caregiver empowerment, access to schooling, access to health and social services, and/or mitigate disparities resulting from social disadvantage.","Yusuf, Wright, Steiman, Gonzalez, Karpur, Shih, Shikako, Elsabbagh","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271229","20220729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35376,""
"Cost of COVID-19: Using life course theory as a lens to understand the consequences of the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated countermeasures have had broad implications across society which will have implications for physical and mental health for years to come. Understanding these experiences through the lens of life course constructs may help communities, service providers including family doctors, and governments to recognize and respond more effectively to the lasting impacts. To use life course theory to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated countermeasures on child and family mental, social, and emotional well-being. Qualitative study including anonymous micro-narrative collection using Spryng.io software (n=210); in-depth interviews with health and social service providers (n=30). Directed content analysis was used to examine the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic as they relate to key constructs in life course theory. Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington counties in South-Eastern Ontario (pop. 210,000). Participants were recruited to the micronarrative collection through convenience sampling using the online data collection tool, as well as through intentional sampling targeting Indigenous people and people experiencing socio economic deprivation and homelessness. Participants for the in-depth interviews were intentionally recruited as key informants from local health and social service organizations. All of the key constructs of life course theory were relevant when applied to our findings. Our data identified meaningful impacts on life course trajectory components including transitions, turning points, and social pathways, as well as using the principles of agency, life span development, linked lives, timing, and time and place. Our data illustrate the pervasive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of the life course. While service providers and policy makers are attuned to the acute crises currently unfolding, the long term impacts of life course disruption will play out over years, or potentially over the entire lifespan of this cohort. Responses to the pandemic cannot limit themselves to crisis management in the next 12-18 months, but will need to integrate an understanding of life course theory to support long term healing of individuals and communities.","Purkey, Bayoumi, Watson, Fu, Davison","https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.20.s1.2742","20220729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35377,""
"M-health Apps and Physical and Mental Health Outcomes of Sexual Minorities","Given the assigned health inequalities faced by sexual minorities, it is fitting to assess whether m-health could be associated with better health-related outcomes for these sexual minorities. The present study examines associations between m-physical and m-mental health apps and sexual minorities' physical and mental health status in Greece. The study utilized three waves of panel data collected in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The findings indicated associations between the use of m-physical and m-mental health apps and increased physical and mental health status for sexual minorities. The work concludes that m-health could enhance informational capabilities associated with increased levels of physical and mental health for sexual minorities. Indeed, the study found that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, sexual minorities experienced physical and mental health deteriorations. Interestingly, the estimates indicated that the association between the use of m-physical and m-mental health apps and increased mental health status for sexual minorities was stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. The study suggests that tracking health-related information through m-health apps during periods of increased uncertainty could be associated with better health prevention and management. If m-health apps can alleviate adverse physical and mental health symptoms for sexual minorities, their potential should be considered.","Drydakis","https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2022.2095240","20220729","COVID-19; M-health; apps; mental health; physical health; sexual minorities; smartphone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35378,""
"Stress and Health Status Among Members of a Disadvantaged Community in Flint, Michigan in the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic creates psychological concerns and stress and its impacts are more extreme for those with health concerns residing in socially and economically disadvantaged communities, such as residents of Flint, Michigan. This study assesses the stress level among people who received community assistance in the first 3 months of COVID lockdowns. Further, it examines associations between stress and physical and mental health status. We measured perceived stress, health concerns, mental distress, and perceived physical and mental health from 106 survey respondents. Comparisons of stress levels by demographics showed that females, high school graduates, and homeowners had higher stress levels than its counterparts. Results from general linear models showed that stress was highest among those with high levels of psychological distress, perceived poor mental health, and more health concerns. The associations between poor perceived physical health and stress were marginal. Homeowners and high school diploma holders showed lower stress levels. This research suggests community health practices tailored to community characteristics and culture will have the greatest impact on stress and health problems in underserved communities.","Kim, Groden","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-022-01120-5","20220729","Covid 19; Flint; Mental health; Physical health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35379,""
"Relationship between the severity of persistent symptoms, physical fitness, and cardiopulmonary function in post-COVID-19 condition A population-based analysis","The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between physical fitness, cardiopulmonary function and patient-reported severity of symptoms in people with post-COVID-19 condition. We examined ambulatory patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°72) with post-COVID-19 condition who had a chronic symptomatic phase lastingÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12Ã‚Â weeks from the onset of symptoms, but had not been hospitalized for acute COVID-19. A comprehensive medical screening was conducted, including clinical history, symptomatology, comorbidities, body composition and physical activity levels. We then identified the relationship between physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength), cardiopulmonary function (echocardiographic and spirometry parameters) and patient-reported severity of symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea, health-related quality of life, anxiety, and depression). Age, body mass index, sex, number of comorbidities and duration of symptoms were included as potential confounders. Results showed that greater physical fitness and cardiopulmonary function were associated with lower severity of symptoms in people with post-COVID-19 condition. Cardiorespiratory fitness, lower-limb muscle strength, maximal voluntary ventilation and left ventricular ejection fraction account for reducing fatigue and dyspnea. Greater physical activity levels were associated with fewer symptoms and less-severe fatigue and dyspnea. In conclusion, preserving better cardiopulmonary health and physical condition during the course of the disease-even in mild cases-was related to a lower intensity of symptoms in non-hospitalized people with post-COVID-19 condition. It is probable that exercise and physical conditioning are valuable pre- and post-COVID-19 countermeasures that could help decrease the severity, not only of acute infection, but of post-COVID-19 persistent symptoms and prognosis.","Jimeno-AlmazÃƒÂ¡n, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Cava, BuendÃƒÂ­a-Romero, Franco-LÃƒÂ³pez, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Agar, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Alcaraz, Tufano, PallarÃƒÂ©s, Courel-IbÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-022-03039-0","20220729","Breathlessness; Fatigue; Long COVID-19; Post-COVID-19 syndrome; Post-exercise malaise; Rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35380,""

Studies were identified by an online search of the PubMed database. We selected studies published from January to May 2020 (during the COVID-19 emergency). We found that psychological effects of COVID-19 remain serious among the most of the population, in particular for people with mental disorders, adolescents, healthcare workers, and the general population that experienced high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, with possible long-term psychological implications. Findings revealed that living in urban areas, having economic stability, and living with parents were protective factors against anxiety for youth groups, whereas a risk factor was represented by the presence of COVID-19 infection that involved family members.","Maresca, Latella, Carnazza, Corallo, Formica","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2602","20220729","COVID-19; emergency psychology; emotional epidemiology; mental health; psychological intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35381,""
"Review of the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence of eating disorders","To review the recent literature on the impact of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on incidence and severity of symptoms of eating disorders (EDs). A worrying increase of EDs in- and outpatients has been reported since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2019/2020. Restrictions implemented during the pandemic to protect populations against COVID-19 increased the risk for onset and for worsening of EDs by disrupting eating and exercise routines, social isolation, lack of support, and limited access to healthcare. Substantial increases since the start of the pandemic have been reported for overall incidence (15%), hospital admissions (48%) and emergency department visits (11%) for EDs, with even higher increases among women and children or adolescents with an ED. During the pandemic, ED patients reported increased severity of ED-specific symptoms and increased anxiety, depression and suicidal ideations and -attempts. Treatments shifted largely toward online methods for continuity of care, despite concerns about the quality of care provided and difficulties in self-monitoring. Our review provides preliminary evidence for a similar effectiveness of online treatment to prepandemic face-to-face treatment. In-person assessment remains essential for detecting EDs and for those requiring medical admission. Although the ongoing COVID-2019 pandemic affected mental health globally, research shows that it particularly affected individuals with an ED diagnosis or at risk for an ED, especially women, children and adolescents, and those with anorexia nervosa.","Meier, van Hoeken, Hoek","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000815","20220729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35382,""
"The Construct Structures of Psychological and Behavioral Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic in Pregnant Women","The present study aimed to investigate the construct structure behind the psychosocial response, behavioral response, prenatal depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The validated Chinese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), PTSD CheckList (PCL)-6, and two newly established scales for COVID-19-related psychological and behavioral responses were used. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was applied to evaluate the structural relationships of psychological and behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 1,908 mothers who completed the questionnaires, 1,099 met the criteria for perinatal depression, and 287 were positively screened for PTSD, where 264 women exceed the cut-off points for both. Pregnant women with full-time or part-time jobs tended to have the lowest scores of EPDS (10.07 Ã‚Â± 5.11, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and stress levels (23.85 Ã‚Â± 7.96, <i>P</i> = 0.004), yet they were more likely to change their behavior in accordance with the COVID-19 outbreak (13.35 Ã‚Â± 3.42, <i>P</i> = 0.025). The structural model fit the data (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 43.260, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and resulted in satisfactory fit indices (CFI = 0.984, TLI = 0.959, RMSEA = 0.072, and Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>/d<i>f</i> = 10.815), all path loadings were significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The SEM indicates that the level of QoL was attributable to the occurrence of PND, leading to PTSD, and COVID-19 related behavioral and psychological responses. The inter-relationships between the COVID-19-related psychosocial and behavioral responses have been assessed, indicating that the pandemic increased the burden of perinatal depression. Psychoeducation, as well as other psychological interventions, may be needed to alleviate the COVID-19-based anxiety and increase their engagement in protective behaviors.","He, Chiu, Lin, Akinwunmi, Wong, Zhang, Ming","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.796567","20220729","COVID-19; perinatal depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; pregnancy; structural equating modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35383,""
"Effects of Online Psychological Crisis Intervention for Frontline Nurses in COVID-19 Pandemic","The psychological problems of frontline nurses in COVID-19 prevention and control are very prominent, and targeted intervention is needed to alleviate them. This study was to assess the impact of online intervention programs on psychological crisis of anxiety, depression levels and physical symptoms among frontline nurses fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. A three-stage online psychological crisis intervention program was established. The General Anxiety 7 (GAD-7) assessment, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Self-rating Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS) were used to evaluate the effect of intervention on the day before entering isolation wards (Time 1), the first day after leaving the isolation ward (Time 2), and at the end of the intervention (Time 3). Sixty-two nurses completed the study, including 59 female (95.2%) and three male nurses (4.8%) with an age range of 23-49 (mean 33.37 Ã‚Â± 6.01). A significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) difference existed in the scores of GAD-7, PHQ-9, and SSS at different intervention periods. The GAD-7 score was significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) lower at the end of quarantine period (time 3) than that before entering the isolation wards (time 1) or after leaving the isolation wards (time 2), the PHQ-9 score was significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.016) lower at the end of quarantine period (time 3) than that after leaving the isolation wards (time 2), and the SSS score was significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) lower at the end of quarantine period (time 3) than that before entering the isolation wards (time 1) or after leaving the isolation wards (time 2). The three-stage online intervention program based on the psychological crisis can be effective in reducing negative emotions and somatic symptoms and improving the mental health of frontline nurses in prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. It may provide an empirical basis for psychological crisis intervention of frontline medical staff when facing public health emergencies.","He, Chang, Lu, Zhang, Zhou, Guo, Gao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.937573","20220729","COVID-19; crisis intervention; nurses; online; psychological crisis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35384,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Smoking Consumption: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global health crisis that has negatively impacted the mental health and wellbeing of the population. A large amount of scientific literature has emerged since 2019, but none of these studies have focused on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on smoking consumption. We aimed to analyse the changes in smoking consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic through longitudinal studies. This systematic review follows the PRISMA Statement. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021282235). MEDLINE, ERIC, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to 24 October 2021. We completed an extensive assessment of all prospective cohort studies that aimed to explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco consumption habits. According to the PICOS's acronym, we included all population (P) types and studies developed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (I) with a change in nicotine consumption as the outcome (O), as well as prospective cohort studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. The results showed that 14 cohorts reported in 11 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 58,052 participants were included in the review. Most of the studies pointed out a reduction in the number of cigarettes and e-cigarettes consumed from baseline (before the pandemic) to follow-up (during the pandemic). Only two studies reported an increase in cigarette or e-cigarette consumption from baseline to follow-up. The majority of studies presented a low risk of bias. In conclusion, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behavior is complex and uncertain. The decrease in smoking consumption during the pandemic could be related to the fear of becoming infected by COVID-19, the advancement of COVID-19, and the reduction in social gatherings. In several cases, the increases in nicotine consumption can be explained by psychological distress. These findings can be used to create strategies to prevent relapses during the post-vaccination phases of the pandemic. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021282235.","Almeda, GÃƒÂ³mez-GÃƒÂ³mez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.941575","20220729","COVID-19; mental health; prospective cohort studies; smoking; systematic review; tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35385,""
"Alcohol Use Among Young Adults in Northern California During the COVID-19 Pandemic-An Electronic Health Records-Based Study","Individuals globally were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in myriad of ways, including social isolation and economic hardship, resulting in negative impacts on mental health and substance use. Young adults have been subjected to extraordinary challenges such as job loss, virtual school, or childcare issues, but have received limited attention from research so far. Using electronic health record data from a large integrated healthcare system in Northern California, this longitudinal observational study examined changes in the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use (identified <i>via</i> systematic alcohol screening in adult primary care) from pre- (3/1/2019-12/31/2019) to post-COVID onset (3/1/2020-12/31/2020) among young adults (18-34 years). Among the 663,111 and 627,095 young adults who utilized primary care in the pre- and post-COVID onset periods, 342,889 (51.9%) and 186,711 (29.8%) received alcohol screening, respectively. We fit generalized estimating equation Poisson models to estimate the change in prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use from pre- to post-COVID onset among those who were screened, while using inverse probability weighting to account for potential selection bias of receiving alcohol screening. Heterogeneity in the change of prevalence by patient characteristics was also examined. Overall, the unadjusted prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use slightly decreased from 9.2% pre-COVID to 9.0% post-COVID onset. After adjusting for patient covariates, the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use decreased by about 2% [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96, 1.00]. The prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use increased among women by 8% (aPR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.11), patients 18-20 years by 7% (aPR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.15), and Latino/Hispanic patients by 7% (aPR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.11). While the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use decreased among men by 12% (aPR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.86, 0.90), patients 21-34 years by 2% (aPR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96, 0.99), White patients by 3% (95% CI = 0.95, 1.00), and patients living in neighborhoods with the lowest deprivation indices by 9% (aPR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.88, 0.94), their unadjusted prevalence remained higher than their counterparts post-COVID onset. There was no variation in the change of prevalence by comorbid mental health conditions or drug use disorders. While changes in unhealthy alcohol use prevalence among young adults were small, findings raise concerns over increased drinking among women, those younger than the U.S. legal drinking age, and Latino/Hispanic patients.","Metz, Palzes, Chi, Campbell, Sterling","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.883306","20220729","COVID-19 pandemic; alcohol use; primary care; screening; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35386,""
"Investigation of Mental Health Literacy and Status of Residents During the Re-Outbreak of COVID-19 in China","The current field of research on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health was mostly limited to the evaluation of the first round of the epidemic, few reports focused on the impact of the re-emergence of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the mental health literacy and status of residents during the re-outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The basic information sheet, health literacy survey scale, physical health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), insomnia severity index (ISI), and Alzheimer dementia 8 (AD8) were applied to evaluate the mental health literacy, mental health status and elderly cognitive function, and Ãâ€¡2 test was applied for analysis of the difference between different groups. A total of 2,306 participants were involved in this study, of which 734 people completed the mental health literacy survey. The qualified rate of mental health literacy was 6.4%. The difference is statistically significant. A total of 1,015 people completed the survey of mental health status, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 8.87%, the monthly income of different families (Ãâ€¡2 = 13.96, <i>P</i> = 0.01), the self-assessed health status (Ãâ€¡2 = 128.56, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), the presence or absence of chronic diseases (Ãâ€¡2 = 4.78, <i>P</i> = 0.03), among all which the difference was statistically significant; the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 3.84%, different regions (Ãâ€¡2 = 12.26, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), occupations (Ãâ€¡2 = 11.65, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), household monthly income (Ãâ€¡2 = 12.65, <i>P</i> = 0.01), self-rated health status (Ãâ€¡2 = 151.11, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and chronic diseases (Ãâ€¡2 = 7.77, <i>P</i> = 0.01), among all which the differences were statistically significant. The prevalence of insomnia symptoms was 7.98%, different age (Ãâ€¡2 = 18.45, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), region (Ãâ€¡2 = 5.11, <i>P</i> = 0.02), monthly household income (Ãâ€¡2 = 12.68 <i>P</i> = 0.01), and self-assessed health status (Ãâ€¡2 = 91.71, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), in which there was a statistically significant difference between those with or without chronic diseases (Ãâ€¡2 = 3 3.25, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). A total of 557 elderly people over 65 years old completed the cognitive dysfunction screening, in which the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction was 17.41%, and the difference was statistically significant at the different self-assessed health status (Ãâ€¡2 = 96.24, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and with or without chronic diseases (Ãâ€¡2 = 107.09, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The mental health literacy and status of residents have not improved significantly during the second outbreak of the epidemic, indicating that under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, more attention should be paid to the mental health of residents, and targeted health education and psychological intervention should be carried out to avoid relative adverse events.","Li, Guo, Lu, Yang, Zhu, Ji, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.895553","20220729","COVID-19; mental health literacy; mental health status; re-outbreak; residents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35387,""
"Will People Accept a Third Booster Dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine? A Cross-Sectional Study in China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are considered to be an effective way to prevent the spread of the infection. Our previous study has shown that about 75% of healthcare workers (HCWs) in China were willing to receive the vaccine when it became available. Here, we examined the acceptance of a third booster dose among Chinese people and identified the influencing factors. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted and the snowball sampling method was utilized. An online questionnaire was provided to all the participants in the form of a quick response (QR) code. The questionnaire included general demographic information, views on vaccines, the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The univariate analysis was done between all the variables and our dependent variable. Then, we used the multivariate logistic regression model to examine the influencing factors of the third booster dose acceptance. We collected 1,062 complete answers. Of these, 90.39% (<i>n</i> = 960) declared that they would accept the booster dose. Knowing more about the vaccine and recognizing the efficacy of vaccines were significantly associated with greater acceptance of the booster dose. People willing to take the booster dose had better psychological health. A belief that the booster dose could prevent severe infection caused by COVID-19 and enhance the effectiveness of the first two doses were the main contributing factors to vaccine acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy was mainly due to a low perceived risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that Chinese people were very receptive to the third booster dose, which is an inspiring result. More positive attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination were supported by its efficacy and few side effects.","Sun, Dai, Wang, Zhang, Cui, Huang, Zhang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.914950","20220729","COVID-19; Chinese people; acceptance; third booster dose; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35388,""
"Digital Interventions to Save Lives From the Opioid Crisis Prior and During the SARS COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review of Australian and Canadian Experiences","The potential for digital initiatives for opioid harm reduction is boundless. Synthesized evidence on current interventions and their efficacy are emerging. This scoping review is an effort to aggregate Canadian and Australian digital health initiatives used to prevent opioid-related deaths and minimize harm, prior to and particularly during the pandemic of SARs-COVID-19, when the crisis escalated. The Joanna Briggs Institute's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews was used. Peer reviewed and gray literature published between January 2016 to October 2021 were included. Search translation was performed across CINAHL, Cochrane, SCOPUS, MEDLINE Complete, and ProQuest Public Health with consistent use of key search terms. Citation checks were also conducted. Studies included were written in English and reported on digital technologies to prevent opioid-related harm and/or mortality in participants aged 18 years or older in Australia and Canada. A total of 16 publications were included in the final analysis (Australia = 5; Canada = 11). The most frequently reported digital technologies were telehealth to support access to treatment (<i>n</i> = 3) and mobile applications for overdose monitoring and prevention (<i>n</i> = 3). Telehealth-delivered opioid replacement therapy demonstrated equal outcomes and treatment retention rates compared to in-person and mobile applications for overdose monitoring demonstrated lifesaving capability through direct linkages with emergency response services. Digital interventions to minimize opioid crisis related harm and overdose prevention are fast emerging in Australia and Canada. During the pandemic, the crisis escalated in both countries as a public health emergency, and different initiatives were trialed. Digital harm reduction solutions via mobile apps (or SaaS solutions) were found to have the potential to prevent accidental overdose deaths and save lives, if rendered through privacy preserved, secure and trust enabled methods that empower users. Knowledge sharing between the two countries, relating to suitable interventions, may add significant value in combatting the escalating opioid crisis in the post pandemic era.","Donnell, Unnithan, Tyndall, Hanna","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.900733","20220729","Australia; COVID-19; Canada; digital health (e-health); harm reduction; mobile apps (SaaS); opioid crisis; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35389,""
"Recovering from COVID-19: psychological sequelae and post-traumatic growth six months after discharge","<b>Background:</b> Clinical and scientific evidence has shown that a range of long-lasting symptoms can persist in the post-virological period. However, little is known about the psychological sequelae of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <b>Objective:</b> This study aims to assess the prevalence of anxiety-depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and post-traumatic growth among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic 6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months after discharge, and to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with psychological outcomes. <b>Method:</b> This cross-sectional cohort study enrolled recovered COVID-19 patients during a multidisciplinary follow-up screening. At 6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months post-discharge, participants underwent a remote assessment with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. <b>Results:</b> The sample was composed of 100 patients, mainly males (72%), with a meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>SD</i> age of 58.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.8 years. Regarding psychological symptoms, 34% and 24% of patients, respectively, reported anxiety and depression over the clinical threshold, and 20% met the criteria for a possible PTSD diagnosis. Psychological symptoms were associated with the presence of a mood disorder in the patient's clinical history and having received a psychological consultation after discharge. Post-traumatic growth was associated with younger age and having received a psychological consultation after discharge. <b>Conclusions:</b> A high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, potentially indicative for a mood or anxiety disorder, and PTSD was confirmed among COVID-19 survivors after 6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months. Anxiety and depressive symptoms and PTSD were associated with a previous diagnosis of a mood disorder and having received psychological consultation. Post-traumatic growth was associated with younger age and having received psychological consultation. Tailored psychological interventions could help to elaborate the psychological suffering and foster post-traumatic growth after a traumatic experience such as COVID-19 hospitalization. A high prevalence of psychological symptoms has been observed among COVID-19 survivors 6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months after hospitalization.Tailored psychological interventions could help to contain the psychological sequelae and facilitate post-traumatic growth. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La evidencia clÃƒÂ­nica y cientÃƒÂ­fica reciente ha demostrado que una variedad de sÃƒÂ­ntomas duraderos pueden persistir incluso en el periodo post-virolÃƒÂ³gico.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patient- and Family-Centered Care and on the Mental Health of Health Care Workers, Patients, and Families","During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals around the world were forced to reorganize their processes in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus while still providing adequate care to patients. In the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) setting, changes in family visitation protocols and restrictions on parent chaperones during hospitalization, as well as other changes, interfered with care. Based on a narrative review of the literature, supported by the authors' observations in practice, we aimed to describe the impact of the pandemic on patient and family-centered care (PFCC) in the PICU environment, especially regarding the presence of family members, family support, and communication with patients and their families, as well as the effects of changes in these practices on the mental health of those involved. In this context, several strategies were used to sustain PFCC, and, despite many challenges, attempts were made to achieve the bare-minimum goals of humanized care for patients, families, and providers alike.","Lessa, Bitercourt, Crestani, Andrade, Costa, Garcia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.880686","20220729","children; family-centered care; health care; humanization of care; intensive care units; pediatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35391,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal attempts and death rates: a systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the risk factors associated with suicidal behavior and thus, prioritizing its prevention is recommended. This study systematically reviewed the global evidence on the incidence of suicide/suicidal attempts and the trend in suicidal rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional and cohort studies investigating the outcomes of suicidal death and suicidal attempts at any setting during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for papers published from December 2019 to May 2021. Out of 1052 studies18 studies with 12,746 suicidal attempts and 33,345 suicidal deaths were included in the final analysis. The mental health impact of social distancing, COVID-19 quarantine, and financial crises due to loss of employment were associated risk factors with suicide and/or suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six common thematic recommendations for preventing suicidal deaths and suicidal attempts were identified. Unexpected behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the increasing trend of suicidal attempts reported. Domestic conflicts and violence, financial loss, anxiety and depression, and pre-existing mental health condition/s should be considered in preventing suicidal attempts and deaths secondary to the COVID 19 pandemic. Early detection and timely intervention for individuals with suicidal behavior is crucial and collated recommendations in the current study can be utilized for those preventive interventions. More systematic suicide risk screening process should be introduced who are at risk, along with an evidence base prevention approach.","Pathirathna, Nandasena, Atapattu, Weerasekara","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04158-w","20220728","COVID-19 pandemic; Lockdown; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2 infection; Suicidal ideation; Suicide; Suicide attempted","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35392,""
"Robust antiviral activity of commonly prescribed antidepressants against emerging coronaviruses: in vitro and in silico drug repurposing studies","During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, symptoms of depression are commonly documented among both symptomatic and asymptomatic quarantined COVID-19 patients. Despite that many of the FDA-approved drugs have been showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and remarkable efficacy against COVID-19 in clinical trials, no pharmaceutical products have yet been declared to be fully effective for treating COVID-19. Antidepressants comprise five major drug classes for the treatment of depression, neuralgia, migraine prophylaxis, and eating disorders which are frequently reported symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Herein, the efficacy of eight frequently prescribed FDA-approved antidepressants on the inhibition of both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was assessed. Additionally, the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-MERS-CoV activities were evaluated. Furthermore, molecular docking studies have been performed for these drugs against the spike (S) and main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) pockets of both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Results showed that Amitriptyline, Imipramine, Paroxetine, and Sertraline had potential anti-viral activities. Our findings suggested that the aforementioned drugs deserve more in vitro and in vivo studies targeting COVID-19 especially for those patients suffering from depression.","Kutkat, Moatasim, Al-Karmalawy, Abulkhair, Gomaa, El-Taweel, Abo Shama, GabAllah, Mahmoud, Kayali, Ali, Kandeil, Mostafa","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17082-6","20220728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35393,""
"Relationships between Intolerance of Uncertainty, Worry, Rumination, and Distress in College Students During the Coronavirus Pandemic: the Role of COVID-19 Threat Appraisals","In two conditional process models, we examined whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) had both direct and indirect effects on coronavirus anxiety (through worry) and depressive symptoms (through rumination) among college students; these associations were hypothesized to be more likely among students who appraised COVID-19 as highly threatening. Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic from September 2020 to November 2020 in the USA. Participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°134) completed measures of IU, COVID-19 specific threat appraisal, rumination, worry, coronavirus anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The PROCESS macro (Model 8) was used for analyses with gender as a covariate. IU had a direct positive effect on coronavirus anxiety and the effect was strongest among students who perceived COVID-19 as more threatening. Threat appraisal did not moderate the IU-depressive symptoms relationship. IU had an indirect effect on depressive symptoms through rumination at all levels of threat appraisal. Unexpectedly, this indirect effect was strongest among students who perceived the pandemic as less threatening. Results may inform interventions that address IU, threat appraisals, and repetitive negative thinking to mitigate symptoms of coronavirus anxiety and depression.","MarÃƒÂ­n-Chollom, Panjwani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-022-10116-3","20220728","COVID-19; Coronavirus anxiety; Depressive symptoms; Intolerance of uncertainty; Rumination; Threat appraisal; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35394,""
"Sleep quality and mental health consequences of COVID-19 pandemic in the aviation community in Greece","To assess the mental health and sleep quality of aviation workers in Greece during the pandemic. A cross-sectional study of aviation workers in Greece was conducted. Sleep disturbances were observed in 25.4% of our 548 participants, while 8.2% and 5.8% reported at least mild depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively. The impact of the pandemic on their mental health was their primary concern which increased for many active pilots according to their workload. Those infected mainly faced daily tiredness and fatigue. Smoking habits and high BMI were a predisposition for more physical symptoms. Cabin crew and women generally yielded worse scores than the other groups. Fear of infection could explain mental health issues while physical symptomatology of those infected could be attributed to long-COVID syndrome. Flight attendants' lower ratings may be due to more occupational exposure.","Karkala, Moschonas, Sykas, Karagianni, Gilou, Papaefthymiou, Kourtidou-Papadeli","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002616","20220728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35395,""
"Evolution of Posttraumatic Symptoms and Related Factors in Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study","This study aimed to (1) evaluate the evolution of mental health (posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSSs], depression, and burnout) of healthcare workers during the second wave of the pandemic (November to December 2020) and compare it with the first wave (March to May 2020), and (2) ascertain the predictors of PTSSs. In March to May 2020 (T1), 269 healthcare professionals working in Spain completed PTSSs, sadness, resilience, and coping questionnaires. In November to December 2020 (T2, N = 58), we assessed PTSSs, sadness, burnout, and depression. Among the healthcare professionals, 63.8% displayed severe PTSSs, 51.7% depressive symptoms, and 79.3% emotional exhaustion (T2). Some risk factors were caring for patients who were severely ill or dying and using rumination, thinking avoidance, self-isolation, emotional expression, and self-blaming as coping strategies. The pandemic has had a deep and long-lasting impact on the healthcare workers' mental health.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Rey, Vega-MarÃƒÂ­n, Bueno-Guerra, Garrido-Hernansaiz","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002605","20220728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-30","",35396,""

"Risk and Resilience Correlates of Reading Among Adolescents with Language-Based Learning Disabilities During COVID-19","Students with language-based learning disabilities (LBLD) can face elevated socio-emotional well- being challenges in addition to literacy challenges. We examined the prevalence of risk and resilience factors among adolescents with LBLD (N = 93), ages 16-18, and the association with reading performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected at the start and end of the first full academic, and remote learning, year of COVID-19 (2020-2021). Participants completed standardized word and text reading measures, as well as self-report surveys of executive functions (EF), and socio-emotional skills associated with resilience (grit, growth mindset, self-management, self-efficacy, and social awareness) or risk (anxiety, depression, COVID-19 related PTSD, and perceived COVID-19 impact). Survey data at the start of the school year (Time 1) captured three underlying factors associated with socioemotional risk, socioemotional resilience, and regulation (i.e., EF). Path analyses revealed that studentsâ€™ Time 2 oral reading scores were significantly and uniquely predicted by socioemotional resilience, even when controlling for word-level reading at Time 1. Socioemotional risk, EF, and perceived COVID-19 impact were not directly related to Time 2 oral reading scores; however, studentsâ€™ resilience mediated the associations between risk and reading outcomes. These results demonstrate that adolescentsâ€™ mental health concerns, self-regulatory ability, and socioemotional resilience were all associated with their experiences of the COVID-19-related stress. However, despite the high-risk context of the pandemic and socio-emotional challenges faced by students with LBLD, our findings indicate that resilience directly predicts end of school year reading outcomes and mediates the impact of socioemotional risk on achievement.","Rebecca A.
