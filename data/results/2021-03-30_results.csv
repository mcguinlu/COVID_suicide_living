"Dysfunctional coping mediates the relationship between stress and mental health in health care staff working amid COVID-19 pandemic","The cross-sectional study aimed to assess the stress outcomes in health care staff working during the Covid-19 pandemic and to explore the role of coping in the relationship between stress outcomes and mental health dimensions with Preacher &amp; Hayes's mediation analysis. 170 participants including physicians (n=41; 24.1%), nurses (n=114, 67.1%) and paramedics (n = 15, 8.8%) with a mean age of 37.69 Ã‚Â± 12,23 years and an average seniority of 14.40 Ã‚Â±12.32 years. were administered The Toronto Alexithymia Scale- 20 (TAS - 20), Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Emotional Processing Scale (EPS) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The data were analyzed by estimation of simple correlation coefficients and a Preacher and Hayes's mediation procedure. Participants reported elevated levels of stress (7-8 sten on the sten scale developed for the PSS-10 questionnaire). Statistically significant differences in the stress levels between nurses, paramedics and physicians could not determined. In contrast, significant association between mental health outcomes and occupational category could not be found. Coping mediated the relationship between coping strategies and mental health outcomes. A positive and significant relationship was observed between stress, dysfunctional coping strategies and mental health. Our observations support the assumption about a controlling role of coping in the relationship between work-related stress and mental health outcomes in the medical staff working amid pandemic.","WarchoÃ…â€š-Biedermann, Daroszewski, BÃ„â€¦czyk, Greberski, Bugajski, KaroÃ…â€ž, Mojs, Ziarko, Jasielska, Samborski","https://doi.org/10.1159/000516181","20210329","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12450,""
"Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Changed the Daily Practices and Psychological State of Orthopaedic Residents?","The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been an unprecedented time for healthcare and has substantially changed resource availability in surgeons' work practices and routines. Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization's mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey's development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of Ã¢â€°Â¤ 7 , 8 to 10, and Ã¢â€°Â¥ 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean Ã‚Â± SD age was 30 Ã‚Â± 3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p &lt; 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p &lt; 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the daily practice of orthopaedic residents and has had important, far-reaching consequences on their health and well-being, including social implications. Residents showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the end of the lockdown. No differences were found in changes of anxiety and depression, over time, for residents who worked in a COVID-19 department compared with those who did not. The evaluation of anxiety and depression through standardized questionnaires could help to identify residents at risk of higher psychological distress who could be referred to regular psychological counseling as a possible prevention strategy during stressful times. Future studies should confirm the long-term effects of these findings.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality of Life of Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Their Caregivers: A Single-Center Survey in Tochigi Prefecture","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population. We investigated the determinants of quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL. Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (16.0%) experienced problems with hospital access, but none reported medication shortages. Strong concerns about COVID-19 were reported by 47.0% of caregivers and 50.0% of PD patients. In PD patients, increased gait disturbance and rigidity, disease severity, smoking, the levodopa equivalent dose and decreased body weight predicted a worse PCS score; anxiety, depression, female sex, stress and long disease duration predicted a worse MCS score. In caregivers, age and smoking contributed to a worse PCS score; depression, stress and worsening patient mood contributed to a worse MCS score. We report the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related QOL and its determinants in PD patients and their caregivers.","Suzuki, Numao, Komagamine, Haruyama, Kawasaki, Funakoshi, Fujita, Suzuki, Okamura, Shiina, Hirata","https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-212560","20210329","COVID-19; Caregivers; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; SARS-CoV-2; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12452,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Individuals With Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Comorbid Anxiety and/or Depression","The goal of this study was to describe the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on ability to engage in activities and the influence on psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms among individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression report increased symptoms and decreased quality of life compared with individuals with IBS alone. The current COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to further influence symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Individuals who met the Rome-IV IBS criteria and reported mild to severe anxiety and/or depression were included. Participants completed an online survey with questions about anxiety, depression, impact of COVID on activities and symptoms, and demographics. Fifty-five individuals participated in the study. The COVID-19 pandemic most commonly influenced their ability to spend time with friends and family, shop for certain types of food, and access health care. Participants also reported increased stress (92%), anxiety (81%), and depressive symptoms (67%). Finally, around half the sample reported increases in abdominal pain (48%), diarrhea (45%), or constipation (44%). The COVID-19 pandemic is related to self-reported increases in psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Additional research is needed to intervene on these symptoms.","Kamp, Levy, Munson, Heitkemper","https://doi.org/10.1097/MCG.0000000000001515","20210329","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12453,""
"The impact of Covid-19 healthcare emergency on the psychological well-being of health professionals: a review of literature","The Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, and later caused a severe health crisis, causing massive disruptions to most healthcare systems worldwide. The Covid-19 health emergency has seen healthcare workers in the front line facing all the difficulties related to the care burden. One of the most significant and probably underinvestigated aspects is the psychological stress of the healthcare staff managing the emergency. The aim of the paper is to analyze the literature on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the psychological well-being of health professionals. We conducted a systematic review of articles published on this topic during the months from January 2020 to December 2020, searching on Pub Med, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Most of the issues can be summarized into five conceptual categories: Stress, Depression and Infection Anxiety, Anguish, Insomnia, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Suicide. The literature identifies many factors contributing to the onset of anxiety, depression, and stress, like the fear of contracting the disease and transmitting it to family members and friends, stressful shifts, and little rest among several others. The literature highlights the needs for adequate measures, including proper psychological support. The conducted review suggests that the behaviours of healthcare professionals during the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic show psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, there is a call for those in chief like hospital managers and policymakers to take action, promoting measures like surveillance, monitoring, and psychological support among others, to increase the resilience of healthcare workers, limiting stress and anxiety and allowing them to keep their performance at work.","Della Monica, Ferrara, Dal Mas, Cobianchi, Scannapieco, F Ruta","https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2445","20210329","emergency management; Covid 19; Psychological stress; healthcare workers; pandemic; psychological assistance; resilience; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12454,""
"Digital Mental Health Challenges and the Horizon Ahead for Solutions","The demand outstripping supply of mental health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic presents opportunities for digital technology tools to fill this new gap and, in the process, demonstrate capabilities to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation. There is a complex range of issues with effectiveness, equity, access, and ethics (eg, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability), which warrant resolution. Evidence-informed policies, development of eminent digital products and services, and skills to use and maintain these solutions are required. Studies need to focus on developing digital platforms with explainable artificial intelligence-based apps to enhance resilience and guide the treatment decisions of mental health practitioners. Investments in digital mental health should ensure their safety and workability. End users should encourage the use of innovative methods to encourage developers to effectively evaluate their products and services and to render them a worthwhile investment. Technology-enabled services in a hybrid model of care are most likely to be effective (eg, specialists using these services among vulnerable, at-risk populations but not severe cases of mental ill health).","Balcombe, De Leo","https://doi.org/10.2196/26811","20210329","COVID-19; challenges; digital mental health implementation; explainable artificial intelligence; human-computer interaction; hybrid model of care; resilience; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12455,""
"Mental health impact of COVID-19 in frontline healthcare workers in a Belgian Tertiary care hospital: a prospective longitudinal study","<b>Objectives</b>: A prospective longitudinal single-centre study to assess the mental health impact of COVID-19 on nurses working in the frontline during the first wave of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Belgium, 2020.<b>Patients and Methods</b>: The study was performed between April 1<sup>st</sup> and 30 June 2020. Nurses who were actively and daily involved in the care of COVID-19 patients on selected intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU wards were included. Depression, somatization, anxiety and distress scores were calculated using the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Brief-COPE questionnaires were used to assess respectively the psychological impact and coping strategies. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire at the start of inclusion, 4Ã‚Â weeks later and 8Ã‚Â weeks later.<b>Results</b>: In total, 39/42 included nurses participated in the study. 4DSQ results showed low rates of depression, anxiety and somatization with a declining trend over time. Distress scores however were high throughout the study period. A past history of stress symptoms was significantly associated with higher distress scores at the inclusion and one month follow-up. As major psychological impact, more participants experienced 'intrusion' compared to 'avoidance' specifically among nurses working on ICU. In 10% of participants, IES-R-scores were predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder.<b>Conclusion</b>: Healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients during the pandemic reported high and enduring distress scores and experienced a major impact on mental health, especially when employed at ICU.

"Resilience, coping style, and COVID-19 stress: effects on the quality of life in frontline health care workers","The aims of the study were to assess the contribution of resilience, coping style, and COVID-19 stress on the quality of life (QOL) in frontline health care workers (HCWs). The study was a cross-sectional surveyperformed among 309 HCWs in a tertiaryhospital during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Data were collected through an anonymous, self-rated questionnaire, including demographic data, a 10-item COVID-19 stress questionnaire, Generic QOL Inventory-74, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Hierarchical regression was used to analyse the relationship between the study variables and the QOL. Among the 309 participants, resilience and active coping were positively correlated with the QOL (P&lt;0.001), whereas, working in confirmed case wards, COVID-19 stress, and passive coping were negatively correlated with the QOL (P&lt;0.001). Resilience and the active coping were negatively correlated with COVID-19 stress (P&lt;0.001). Resilience, coping style,and COVID-19 stressaccounted for 32%, 13%, and 8% of the variance in predicting the Global QOL, respectively. In conclusion, working in confirmed COVID-19 case wards and COVID-19 stress impaired the QOL in HCWs.

"Psychological well-being and coping strategies of elderly people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary","During COVID-19 lockdown the enforced social isolation and other pandemic-related changes highly increased the risk of mental health problems. We aimed to discover how elderly people coped with the psychological burdens of pandemic and the social isolation in Hungary. This study included 589 (441 females) Hungarian individuals, aged 60-83 (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°68.1, SD = 4.46). We collected online survey data to reach a wide population of elderly. Results of hierarchical linear modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses established how the current life-changing circumstances, the intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness and social support influence the mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, well-being) of the elderly. The model was used to explore how adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the effects. Findings showed that perceived change in mood, social connectedness, and quality of life was negatively affected by catastrophizing and loneliness; whereas positive refocusing and contamination fear had a positive effect. According to the SEM analysis, intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness directly affected mental health. Further, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategy mediated the connection between social support from friends, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Overall, our research might help the understanding of how external and internal factors contributed to the well-being of elderly people during the COVID-19. The model can also be translated into professional interventions to develop coping strategies among elderly for the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic in their lives.","LÃƒÂ¡badi, AratÃƒÂ³, Budai, InhÃƒÂ³f, Stecina, SÃƒÂ­k, ZsidÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1902469","20210329","Aging; coronavirus; mental health; social isolation; structural equation modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12458,""

"Gender Differences in Psychological and Behavioral Responses of Infected and Uninfected Health-Care Workers During the Early COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Objective:</b> Understanding gender differences in responses of health-care workers (HCWs) to COVID-19 outbreak is an effective way to promote customized supports. <b>Methods:</b> During February 2020, 103 HCWs infected with COVID-19 (64 females and 39 males) and 535 uninfected HCWs (383 females and 152 males) were recruited in a cross-sectional study. Level of attention, six emotional status, and self-evaluation of eight protective measures were recorded. Multivariable Firth's logistic regressions were applied to explored independent effect of gender. <b>Results:</b> During early outbreak, female HCWs were more likely to give greater attention, adjusted OR:1.92 (95%CI 1.14-3.23) in total HCWs. Higher proportion of anxiety was observed in female HCWs, adjusted OR:3.14 (95%CI 1.98-4.99) for total HCWs, 4.32(95%CI 1.32-14.15) for infected HCWs and 2.97 (1.78, 4.95) for uninfected HCWs. Proportion of pessimism, fear, full of fighting spirit, and optimism were low, and no gender differences were observed. During a later outbreak, a majority of HCWs reported being very familiar with eight protective measures. After training, a proportion of high self-evaluation in hand hygiene, wearing gloves, and surgical masks increased independently in female HCWs, and adjusted ORs were 3.07 (95% CI 1.57-5.99), 2.37 (95% CI 1.26-4.49), and 1.92 (95% CI 1.02-3.62), respectively.

"Media consumption and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown: a UK cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland","As individuals adjust to new 'norms' and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The cross-sectional study data was collected using an online survey following the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with some other basic information collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the influence of socio-demographic and media specific factors on anxiety and depression. The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores. This study indicated that higher media consumption was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Worldwide it should be acknowledged that excessive media consumption, particularly social media relating to COVID-19, can have an effect on mental health. However, as this was a cross-sectional study we cannot infer any directionality as we cannot infer cause and effect; therefore, future research involving longitudinal data collection and analyses of variables over time is warranted.","Neill, Blair, Best, McGlinchey, Armour","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01506-0","20210329","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Media consumption; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12462,""
"Meditating in Virtual Reality 3: 360Ã‚Â° Video of Perceptual Presence of Instructor","The need for remote delivery of mental health interventions including instruction in meditation has become paramount in the wake of the current global pandemic. However, the support one may usually feel within the physical presence of an instructor may be weakened when interventions are delivered remotely, potentially impacting one's meditative experiences. Use of head-mounted displays (HMD) to display video-recorded instruction may increase one's sense of psychological presence with the instructor as compared to presentation via regular flatscreen (e.g., laptop) monitor. This research therefore evaluated a didactic, trauma-informed care approach to instruction in mindfulness meditation by comparing meditative responses to an instructor-guided meditation when delivered face-to-face vs. by pre-recorded 360Ã‚Â° videos viewed either on a standard flatscreen monitor (2D format) or via HMD (i.e., virtual reality [VR] headset; 3D format). Young adults (<i>n</i> = 82) were recruited from a university introductory course and experienced a 360Ã‚Â° video-guided meditation via HMD (VR condition, 3D format). They were also randomly assigned to practice the same meditation either via scripted face-to-face instruction (in vivo [IV] format) or when viewed on a standard laptop display (non-VR condition, 2D format). Positive and negative affect and meditative experience ratings were self-reported and participants' maintenance of focused attention to breathing (i.e., meditation breath attention scores [MBAS]) were recorded during each meditation. Meditating in VR (3D format) was associated with a heightened experience of awe overall. When compared to face-to-face instruction (IV format), VR meditation was rated as less embarrassing but also less enjoyable and more tiring. When compared to 2D format, VR meditations were associated with greater experiences of relaxation, less distractibility from the process of breathing, and less fatigue. No differences were found between VR and non-VR meditation in concentration (MBAS). Baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms were risk factors for experiencing distress while meditating in either (VR and non-VR) instructional format. Of those who reported a preference for one format, approximately half preferred the VR format and approximately half preferred the IV format. Recorded 360Ã‚Â° video instruction in meditation viewed with a HMD (i.e., VR/3D format) appears to offer some experiential advantage over instructions given in 2D format and may offer a safe-and for some even preferred-alternative to teaching meditation face-to-face.

"Is COVID-19 Immune to Misinformation? A Brief Overview","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation is a major challenge, raising several social and psychological concerns. This article highlights the prevailing misinformation as an outbreak containing hoaxes, myths, and rumours. In comparison to traditional media, online media platforms facilitate misinformation even more widely. To further affirm this ethical concern, the researchers cite relevant studies demonstrating the role of new media in misinformation and its potential consequences. Besides other significant psychosocial impacts, such as xenophobia, psychological distress, LGBT rights violation, gender-based violence, misinformation is undermining healthcare workers' psychological health and their efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. In view of the adverse consequences of misinformation, this article addresses it as a massive ethical challenge during the current outbreak. Thus, the researchers make relevant suggestions to evaluate misinformation sources and mitigate the psychosocial impacts attributed to misinformation during crises. They include forming mental health teams comprising of psychologists, psychiatrists, and trained paramedical staff; rapid dissemination of authentic and updated COVID-19 situation reports regularly; establishing helpline services; and recognizing a broader range of personal needs. All health authorities should make clear that they are listening and responding to public concerns. Much effort is needed to counteract COVID-19 misinformation.","Ali, Khalid, Zahid","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-020-00155-x","20210329","COVID-19; Healthcare; Mass media; Misinformation; Pandemic; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12464,""
"A Longitudinal Study on Generalized Anxiety Among University Students During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Switzerland","The COVID-19 pandemic and government measures implemented to counter the spread of the infection may be a major stressor affecting the psychological health of university students. This study aimed to explore how anxiety symptoms changed during the pandemic. 676 students (76% females) at Zurich University of Applied Sciences participated in the first (T0) and second (T1) survey waves. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-Scale-7 (GAD-7). Risk and protective factors (e.g., COVID-19-related variables) were examined. GAD-7 scores decreased significantly from T0 to T1 (mean change: -0.446, SE = 0.132, 95% CI: -0.706, -0.186, <i>t</i> = -3.371, <i>df</i> = 659, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Participants with moderate-to-severe anxiety score were 20.2 and 15.6% at T0 and T1, respectively. The following positively predicted anxiety: older age, female gender, non-Swiss nationality, loneliness, participants' concern about their own health, and interaction between time and participants' concern about their own health. Resilience and social support negatively predicted anxiety. Our findings provide information for public health measures and psychological interventions supporting the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 emergency.","Amendola, von Wyl, Volken, Zysset, Huber, Dratva","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643171","20210329","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; coronavirus; linear mixed model; lockdown; longitudinal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12465,""
"Don't Think That Kids Aren't Noticing: Indirect Pathways to Children's Fear of COVID-19","The present study is couched within Rachman's three-pathway theory of fear acquisition (Rachman, 1977, 1991). Besides the direct contact with the objects of fear, this model also includes two indirect pathways to fear acquisition: negative information transmission and modeling. The study aims to explore the contribution of these three factors to the level of children's fear of COVID-19. The sample consisted of 376 children (59.6% girls), aged 7-19 (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 12.77, SD<sub>age</sub> = 3.57), and one of their parents (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 42.88, SD<sub>age</sub> = 6.00). The survey was conducted online during the COVID-19 national state of emergency in the Republic of Serbia. The children assessed their fear of COVID-19, general fearfulness, negative information transmission, and modeling by their parents, as well as the level of exposure to negative information outside their home. The parents assessed their own fear of COVID-19 and trait anxiety. Parents' anxiety, children's age, and children's general fearfulness were used as covariates. The results of our path analysis provide support for Rachman's notion of indirect pathways. The more the parents were afraid of COVID-19, the more they expressed this (either verbally or through their behavior), which in turn led to an increase in the children's fear of COVID-19. Furthermore, children's exposure to negative information related to COVID-19, provided by their teachers and peers or stemming from the media, directly contributed to the level of children's fear. The results of the study emphasize the importance of caregivers' behavior during global health crises and provide some clues as to what caregivers may do to protect their children's mental health in such circumstances.","RadanoviÃ„â€¡, MiciÃ„â€¡, PavloviÃ„â€¡, KrstiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635952","20210329","COVID-19; children; fear; indirect pathways; parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12466,""
"Longitudinal Trajectories of Study Characteristics and Mental Health Before and During the COVID-19 Lockdown","The <i>COVID-19 lockdown</i> has significantly disrupted the higher education environment within the Netherlands and led to changes in available study-related resources and study demands of students. These changes in <i>study resources</i> and <i>study demands</i>, the uncertainty and confusion about educational activities, the developing fear and anxiety about the disease, and the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown measures may have a significant impact on the <i>mental health</i> of students. As such, this study aimed to investigate the trajectory patterns, rate of change, and longitudinal associations between study resources-demands and mental health of 141 university students from the Netherlands before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The present study employed a longitudinal design and a piecewise latent growth modeling strategy to investigate the changes in study resources and mental health over a 3 month period. The results showed that moderate levels of student resources significantly decreased before, followed by a substantial rate of increase during, lockdown. In contrast, study demands and mental health were reported to be moderate and stable throughout the study. Finally, the growth trajectories of study resources-demands and mental health were only associated before the lockdown procedures were implemented. Despite growing concerns relating to the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 on students, our study shows that the mental health during the initial COVID-19 lockdown remained relatively unchanged.","van Zyl, Rothmann, Zondervan-Zwijnenburg","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.633533","20210329","COVID-19; coronavirus; mental health; piecewise latent growth modeling; study resources; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12467,""
"The Effect of Religion on Psychological Resilience in Healthcare Workers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Healthcare workers in the front line of diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at great risk of both infection and developing mental health symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the following: (1) whether healthcare workers in general hospitals experience higher mental distress than those in psychiatric hospitals; (2) the role played by religion and alexithymic trait in influencing the mental health condition and perceived level of happiness of healthcare workers amidst the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic; and (3) factors that influence the resilience of healthcare workers at 6 weeks' follow-up. <b>Methods:</b> Four-hundred and fifty-eight healthcare workers were recruited from general and psychiatric hospitals, and 419 were followed-up after 6 weeks. All participants filled out the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, five-item Brief-Symptom Rating Scale, and the Chinese Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> Under the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, 12.3% of frontline healthcare workers in general hospitals reported having mental distress and perceived lower social adaptation status compared with those working in psychiatric hospitals. Christians/Catholics perceived better psychological well-being, and Buddhists/Taoists were less likely to experience mental distress. The results at 6 weeks of follow-up showed that the perceived lower social adaptation status of general hospital healthcare workers was temporary and improved with time. Christian/Catholic religion and time had independent positive effects on psychological well-being; however, the interaction of Christian/Catholic religion and time had a negative effect. <b>Conclusions:</b> Collectivism and individualism in the cultural context are discussed with regard to alexithymic trait and Buddhist/Taoist and Christian/Catholic religious faiths. Early identification of mental distress and interventions should be implemented to ensure a healthy and robust clinical workforce for the treatment and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chang, Chen, Lee, Lin, Chiang, Tsai, Kuo, Lung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.628894","20210329","COVID-19; health care workers; mental distress; religion; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12468,""
"Social Support and Hope Mediate the Relationship Between Gratitude and Depression Among Front-Line Medical Staff During the Pandemic of COVID-19","The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has burdened an unprecedented psychological stress on the front-line medical staff, who are at high risk of depression. While existing studies and theories suggest that factors such as gratitude, social support, and hope play a role in the risk of depression, few studies have combined these factors to explore the relationship between them. This study examined the mediating roles of social support and hope in the relationship between gratitude and depression among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19. This study used the Gratitude Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the State Hope Scale (SHS), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to examine the gratitude, social support, hope, and depression among 344 front-line medical workers in Wuhan, which was the hardest-hit area of COVID-19 in China. The results showed that the prevalence of mild depressive disorder was 40.12% and the prevalence of major depressive disorder was 9.59% among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19; gratitude has a direct and negative effect on depression. Gratitude was negative predictors of depression through the mediating variables of social support and hope [ÃŽÂ² <sub> <i>gratitude</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>social support</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>depression</i> </sub> = -0.096, 95%CI(-0.129 to -0.064); ÃŽÂ² <sub> <i>gratitude</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>hope</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>depression</i> </sub> = -0.034, 95%CI(-0.055 to -0.013)], as well as via an indirect path from social support to hope [ÃŽÂ² <sub> <i>gratitude</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>social support</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>hope</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>depression</i> </sub> = -0.089, 95%CI (-0.108 to -0.070)]. The study findings indicate that gratitude as a positive emotion can reduce depression in medical staff by promoting social support and hope, respectively. Gratitude also reduced depression in health care workers through a chain mediating effect of social support and hope. Overall, gratitude can directly foster social support and hope, and protect people from stress and depression, which has implications for clinical interventions among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19.","Feng, Yin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623873","20210329","COVID-19; depression; gratitude; hope; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12469,""
"&quot;What If We Get Sick?&quot;: Spanish Adaptation and Validation of the Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation Scale in a Non-clinical Sample Exposed to the COVID-19 Pandemic","Distinct sources of stress have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, fear is expected to generate significant psychological burden on individuals and influence on either unsafe behavior that may hinder recovery efforts or virus-mitigating behaviors. However, little is known about the properties of measures to capture them in research and clinical settings. To resolve this gap, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel measure of fear of illness and viruses and tested its predictive value for future development of distress. We extracted a random sample of 450 Chilean adult participants from a large cross-sectional survey panel and invited to participate in this intensive longitudinal study for 35 days. Of these, 163 ended up enrolling in the study after the demanding nature of the measurement schedule was clearly explained to them. For this final sample, we calculated different Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) to evaluate the preliminary proposed structure for the instrument. Complementarily, we conducted a content analysis of the items to qualitatively extract its latent structure, which was also subject to empirical test via CFA. Results indicated that the original structure did not fit the data well; however, the new proposed structure based on the content analysis did. Overall, the modified instrument showed good reliability through all subscales both by its internal consistency with Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.814 to 0.913, and with test-retest correlations ranging from 0.715 to 0.804. Regarding its convergent validity, individuals who scored higher in fears tended to also score higher in depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms at baseline. Furthermore, higher fears at baseline predicted a higher score in posttraumatic stress symptomatology 7 days later. These results provide evidence for the validity, reliability, and predictive performance of the scale. As the scale is free and multidimensional potentially not circumscribed to COVID-19, it might work as a step toward understanding the psychological impact of current and future pandemics, or further life-threatening health situations of similar characteristics. Limitations, practical implications, and future directions for research are discussed.","Cottin, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez, LabbÃƒÂ©, Quevedo, Davanzo, Behn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.590283","20210329","COVID-19; FIVE; SARS-CoV-2; Spanish adaptation and validation; fear; pandemic; psychological impact; virus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12470,""
"Side by Side: Reflections on Two Lifetimes of Dance","Telling stories about our experiences in dance brings to light unconscious knowledge and memories of the past and helps us understand our own decisions and practices. Reflexivity and story telling is central in the process of remembering and embodies some of the key aspects of autoethnography as a research tool. We are directed to examine and reflect on our experiences, analyzing goals and intentions, making connections between happenings and recounting each single experience. Dance has the potential for positive impact on both physical and mental health among professional dancers as well as among dance students and has the power to connect them to culture and community in unique and important ways. Research has provided evidence that arts engagement provides positive forms of social inclusion, opportunities to share arts, culture, language, and values and points to the value of the arts in the prevention and amelioration of health problems. Together with those benefits of a dance experience there is clear evidence of what can be learned in, through and about dance. In this time of the Covid-19 pandemic it seemed more relevant and poignant to examine our own experiences in dance as well as those experiences of others that have influenced our lives.","Kipling Brown, Penniston Gray","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.587379","20210329","access; dance; education; embodiment; participation; self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12471,""
"Physical Activity Protects Against the Negative Impact of Coronavirus Fear on Adolescent Mental Health and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The severity of the Coronavirus pandemic has led to lockdowns in different countries to reduce the spread of the infection. These lockdown restrictions are likely to be detrimental to mental health and well-being in adolescents. Physical activity can be beneficial for mental health and well-being; however, research has yet to examine associations between adolescent physical activity and mental health and well-being during lockdown. <b>Purpose:</b> Examine the effects of adolescent perceived Coronavirus prevalence and fear on mental health and well-being and investigate the extent to which physical activity can be a protective factor against these concerns. <b>Methods:</b> During United Kingdom lockdown restrictions, 165 participants (100 female, aged 13-19) completed an online questionnaire assessing perceived Coronavirus prevalence and fear, physical activity, and indicators of mental health and well-being (stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, vitality, and perceived health). Separate hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses (with age, gender, perceived Coronavirus prevalence, and fear entered in step 1, and physical activity in step 2) were run to predict each well-being outcome. <b>Results:</b> Regression analyses indicated that in general, while Coronavirus fear was a negative predictor, physical activity was a positive and stronger predictor of enhanced mental health and well-being outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Findings suggest that physical activity during the Coronavirus pandemic can counteract the negative effects of Coronavirus fear on adolescent mental health and well-being. Therefore, physical activity should be promoted during lockdown to support good mental health and well-being.","Wright, Williams, Veldhuijzen van Zanten","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.580511","20210329","COVID-19; anxiety; exercise; fatigue; stress; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12472,""
"Coping Styles, Mental Health, and the COVID-19 Quarantine: A Nationwide Survey in Poland","<b>Background:</b> The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 that began from March 2020 is yet to be contained. Consequences of the ongoing pandemic may have a negative impact on the mental health of affected individuals. This particularly refers to those quarantined. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is currently one of the biggest health issues worldwide, a higher demand emerges for research concentrating on the worsening of psychological well-being among the general and the quarantined population, as well as on individual coping strategies that may moderate the occurrence of psychopathologies. <b>Method:</b> Data were collected within the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Participants represented quarantine (+) and quarantine (-) groups. Quarantine (+) group, different from quarantine (-), consisted of people who experienced it themselves or someone close to them did after contacting an infected individual. To measure psychopathological symptoms a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used. For measuring PTSD symptoms, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used. This study followed the coping strategies manifested among the participants using the MiniCope questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,036 individuals participated in this study. Quarantine (+) individuals had significantly higher total and subscales GHQ-28 scores (anxiety, insomnia, and somatic symptoms) as well as a higher IES-R arousal score. The quarantine (+) individuals were more likely to use self-distraction as a coping strategy. This research identified positive and negative correlations between presented coping styles and manifested psychopathology. <b>Conclusion:</b> This nationwide study suggests occurrence of negative effects on mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. It is observed on most of the measured psychopathological symptoms.

"Effectiveness of a Virtual Exercise Program During COVID-19 Confinement on Blood Pressure Control in Healthy Pregnant Women","The situation caused by COVID-19 has led to movement restrictions for the majority of the population due to the confinement established by the health authorities. This new situation has changed people's habits and significantly affected the pregnant population. Decreased exercise and increased psychophysical stress are associated with excessive weight gain, diabetes, and gestational cardiovascular complications that affect the mother, fetus, and newborn. Recent research shows that the dynamics of maternal blood pressure is one of the most important control factors during pregnancy. Thus, prevention of these type of pathologies through interventions without maternal-fetal risks is important. To examine the influence of a virtual exercise program on maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. A randomized clinical trial design was used (NCT04563065). Data from 72 pregnant women without obstetric contraindications under confinement conditions in the Madrid area were collected. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention (IG) or control group (CG). They previously signed informed consent forms. A moderate exercise program was performed as an intervention from 8-10 to 38-39 weeks of pregnancy. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) maternal blood pressure were measured during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, as well as before and immediately after delivery in both study groups. No differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the first, second and third trimesters were found between groups. Significant differences in SBP were found immediately before delivery (IG = 119.83 Ã‚Â± 10.16 vs. CG = 125.6 Ã‚Â± 10.91; <i>p</i> = 0.047) and immediately after delivery (IG = 115.00 Ã‚Â± 11.18 vs. CG = 122.24 Ã‚Â± 15.71; <i>p</i> = 0.045). Results show lower SBP values for the IG during delivery than CG. A virtual exercise program throughout pregnancy during COVID-19 confinement can help to control systolic blood pressure before and immediately after delivery in healthy pregnant women.","Silva-Jose, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-PolÃƒÂ¡n, Diaz-Blanco, CoterÃƒÂ³n, Barakat, Refoyo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.645136","20210329","exercise; gestational hypertension; maternal; pandemic; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12474,""
"Validation of the FCV-19 Scale and Assessment of Fear of COVID-19 in the Population of Mozambique, East Africa","This study aimed to validate the Portuguese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and investigate its association with sociodemographic and pandemic-related variables in the population of Mozambique. A cross-sectional online survey recruited 387 Mozambicans aged 18 to 70 years. The psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and Rash analysis. Additionally, the association of the FCV-19S with sociodemographic and pandemic-related variables was investigated using the two-sample <i>t</i>-test, one-way analysis of variance, and logistic regression. The unidimensional factor structure of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S was confirmed, and the scale showed good internal consistency reliability. The FCV-19S properties tested from the Rasch analysis were satisfactory. Women and those with lower education levels had higher scores of fear. Moreover, significantly higher levels of fear were observed among those being in an at-risk group for COVID-19, having family members or friends diagnosed or with death confirmed by COVID-19, and not being confident that they would receive adequate care from the public health services in case of COVID-19 infection. The Portuguese version of FCV-19S has strong psychometric properties and can be used to assess the fear of COVID-19 in the Portuguese-speaking population of Mozambique. As the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health represents a challenge to clinical psychiatry, and information on mental health in African countries is still scarce, our findings may assist in the planning of public mental health policies, aimed mainly at specific segments of the population, such as women and people in extreme poverty.","Giordani, Giolo, Muhl, Estavela, Mabuie Gove","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S298948","20210329","fear scale; infection; mental health; pandemic; psychometrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12475,""
"Adaptations of an Integrated Behavioral Health Program During COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has consistently been described as an &quot;unprecedented&quot; global health crisis. While the focus has been primarily on the medical and economic impact of the pandemic, psychological sequelae are anticipated. Primary care is the main point of access for mental health care in the United States, making it the ideal locale to provide psychological services for a larger proportion of the population than traditional mental health care settings. The aim of this paper is to describe how our multi-state, multi-site integrated primary care program adapted and applied cognitive behavioral therapy in the context of COVID-19. Access to mental health care was disrupted despite burgeoning mental health concerns, necessitating novel approaches to providing care. A stepped-care approach was implemented within our primary care practice, which consisted of a combination of low-intensity, high-yield stress management and resiliency building resources and cognitive behavioral therapy that were delivered flexibly based on patient preference, technological capabilities, state ordinances, insurance coverage, and institutional policies.

Study participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°82, <i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.07, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.55) were all Greek adults divided into an intervention (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44) and a control group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38). The intervention group attended a voluntary, online, two-week, six-session (each 50Ã‚Â min), group intervention. The intervention aimed at enhancing participants' personal strengths and resilience in order to cope more effectively with the psychological impact of social distancing (e.g., feelings of anxiety, sadness, fear, and/or loneliness). All participants completed an online questionnaire one week before the intervention's implementation, which included scales measuring their: demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. Participants in both the intervention and control group completed the same measures the week following the intervention's termination to examine its effects, and two weeks later to examine its long-term effectiveness. The intervention was found to be effective in alleviating the impact of the pandemic and in strengthening participants' resilience. More specifically, the results showed significant decreases for the intervention group in all measures of psychosocial distress (anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear) and significant increases in empathy, resilience, and experience of positive emotions. The study's implications for the development and implementation of online psychological interventions during a crisis are discussed.","Brouzos, Vassilopoulos, Baourda, Tassi, Stavrou, Moschou, Brouzou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01613-x","20210329","COVID-19; Group intervention; Resilience; Social distancing; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12477,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath: Knowledge, attitude, behavior, and mental health-care needs of medical undergraduates","The undeniable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the educational sector has left the students perplexed and uncertain. Infection-related fears, inevitable loneliness, disturbed routine making way for adverse lifestyle habits, stressors such as financial crisis faced by their families, and many more further accentuate their vulnerability to mental health issues. The aim was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of medical undergraduate students about the COVID-19 outbreak, and to assess their stress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL). The study also explored the correlation between the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the medical undergraduate students about the pandemic and their mental health issues. An online questionnaire-based survey was carried out on medical undergraduate students. The survey tool comprised a semi-structured proforma; General Health Questionnaire-12 items; Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale-21 items; and European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life-8 items. Nearly 61.8% of the students seemed well read and had good knowledge about the medical aspects of the pressing issue of COVID-19, and majority of the students had adaptive attitudes and behaviors toward the pandemic. Almost 23.2% of the students had depression, 20.7% had anxiety, and 13.0% had stress ranging from mild to extremely severe. Nearly 75.1% of the students experienced changes in appetite and 53.6% had changes in appetite. Nearly half of the students expressed excessive worries regarding studies. The mean score of QOL of students was 3.9 Ã‚Â± 0.6. Students with adaptive attitudes and behavior experienced relatively less severe depression, anxiety, and stress compared to their counterparts. A significant portion of the medical undergraduates are experiencing mental health issues and study related concerns due to the adversity brought by the pandemic. The concerned educational bodies and institutes must take up necessary steps to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on students.","Shailaja, Singh, Chaudhury, Thyloth","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_117_20","20210329","Anxiety; COVID-19; attitude; behavior; depression; knowledge; medical students; pandemic; psychiatric morbidity; psychological impact; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12478,""
"Psychological management of mental health concerns related to COVID-19: A review of guidelines and recommendations","Many publications have delineated strategies for mental health care to respond to psychological concerns and ramifications related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current review aims to encapsulate existing guidelines and recommendations of psychological management for mental health care for the general population, health-care professionals, children, and elderly populations, applied to a pandemic in particular reference to COVID-19. The literature on psychological care of such repercussions of COVID-19 was retrieved via a search in PubMed and Google database. Of 91 retrieved initial articles, only 18 were selected for final analysis, which was divided into two categories: (a) guidelines by government/public health bodies (<i>n</i> = 11) and (b) publications in peer-reviewed journals (<i>n</i> = 7). The recommendations can be summed but not limited to psychoeducation from a reliable source, normalization of stress, behavioral activation, scheduling of activities with a bespoke blending of recreational and daily chores, supportive care, staying digitally connected, relaxation techniques, ensuring rest, rotating shifts and short breaks during working hours, curtailing media consumption, fostering community resilience, seeking and sharing support from colleagues/supervisors, avoidance of abusing psychoactive substances, online consultation of mental health professionals on need, and participatory communication in a developmentally appropriate way with children. In the absence of observational and controlled studies on psychological management during pandemic times, we recommend such research soon.","Samantaray, Pattanaik, Srivastava, Singh","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_81_20","20210329","Children; coronavirus disease 2019; elderly; general populations; health-care professionals; mental health; pandemic; psychological management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12479,""

"[Indirect and direct psychosocial consequences of the corona pandemic-partÃ‚Â 1 of aÃ‚Â (preliminary) review]","The pandemic triggered by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, apart from aÃ‚Â few positive effects, led to massive and manifold impairments of human living conditions for which this article suggests aÃ‚Â taxonomy. According to the severity, these impairments have resulted in a deterioration of the psychological well-being for many people and an increased vulnerability for psychological disorders. This has been confirmed by numerous studies and review articles, which also dealt with the question of factors that positively as well as negatively influencing mental health. This review shows that, e.g. suffering from COVID-19 disease, younger age and female gender as well as aÃ‚Â pre-existing psychiatric or somatic disease must be considered as special risk factors. Psychotherapists are confronted with the pandemic in different ways. In view of the societal impact psychotherapists have aÃ‚Â special role.

"Contact Tracing for COVID-19: The Use of Motivational Interviewing and the Role of Social Work","One method in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 is that of contact tracing. It is estimated that in the US, 35,000-100,000 contact tracers will be hired (and trained) to talk to recently-infected individuals, understand who they have exposed to the virus, and encourage those exposed to self-quarantine. The Center for Disease Control recommends the use of motivational interviewing (MI) by contact tracers to encourage compliance with contact tracing/quarantine. Contact tracers need to sensitively communicate with COVID-19-exposed individuals who may also be experiencing other issues caused by the pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, grief, anger, intimate partner violence, health problems, food insecurity, and/or unemployment. Social workers are particularly prepared to address the mental health and other psychosocial problems that may be encountered in the tracing process. This article describes contact tracing, its use in other diseases, the role of MI, psychosocial issues that contact tracers may encounter, and how social work can respond to these needs. A sample dialogue of contact tracing using MI is presented with a discussion of the content and skills used in the process.","Hohman, McMaster, Woodruff","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00802-2","20210329","COVID-19; Contact tracing; Motivational interviewing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12483,""
"Burnout in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: New challenges for public health","During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline nurses have faced extraordinary personal and professional challenges. These challenges have had mental health consequences, and concerning reports of burnout have emerged globally. We conducted a cross-sectional survey at a designated COVID-19 hospital in Shanghai at the peak of the pandemic, i.e. about 2 months after the onset of the outbreak from February to April 2020. Findings revealed burnout in 6.85% of nurses. Of 336 respondents, 87 (25.89%) had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 61 (18.15%) had a high level of depersonalization, and 100 (29.76%) had a low level of personal accomplishment. Burnout can be prevented by offering more support from families and supervisors, paying attention to health monitoring and personal protection, and creating a rational human resource allocation and shift management system. Specific training on infection control and self-protection, mental health guidance, and stress coping techniques must be implemented. As the current health crisis ultimately abates, moving the focus from mental health issues to public health issues, more attention and support at the national and organizational levels are needed to reduce occupational discrimination, nurse autonomy and status need to be promoted, and public health emergency teams need to be created. A positive and fair working environment is essential to effective healthcare delivery.","Zhang, Chai, Zhao, Wang, Sun, Lu, Lu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2021.01099","20210329","COVID-19; Chinese nurses; Shanghai; burnout; workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12484,""
"Mental Health and Physical Activity among Children and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing disruptions in the global social system. Japanese children and adolescents have had their schools closed, government-mandated activity restrictions imposed, and interactions outside the home reduced. These restrictions can have a considerable psychological impact on children and adolescents. This review aims to describe the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity and psychological status of this population. The review was conducted by searching PubMed for information on the impact of COVID-19-related activity restrictions on children and adolescents. The search identified 11 articles, three of which contained data on anxiety and psychological problems due to physical inactivity. Next, a PubMed search was conducted about physical activity and psychological status in children and adolescents under psychological stress. The search identified 368 articles, 28 of which were included in the review. For children, data that revealed a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and sedentary time leading to mood disorders were included. For adolescents, there were nine studies that reported a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and four studies that reported no correlation between physical activity and psychological health. Of the studies that reported a correlation, seven reported that physical activity improves psychological health. The impact of psychologically stressful situations such as COVID-19 on children and adolescents has been experienced worldwide. Physical activity has been correlated with psychological health, and it may improve psychological status; physical activity should be recommended to better support the psychological health of children and adolescents under the influence of COVID-19.","Okuyama, Seto, Fukuda, Funakoshi, Amae, Onobe, Izumi, Ito, Imamura","https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.253.203","20210329","coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; disaster medicine; mental health; physical activity; school restriction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12485,""
"Longitudinal evidence on mental health changes of college students with and without mental disorder background during the Argentina's lengthy mandatory quarantine","This study examined the changes in the mental health state of college students with and without mental disorder background, during successive time cuts of the Argentina's lengthy mandatory quarantine, while adjusting for quarantine duration, sex, age, suicidal behavior history, loneliness, and region of residence. We used a longitudinal design (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1615, 26% with mental disorder history). Successive samplings were performed from three days before quarantine start and across quarantine phases of up to 103-days duration. Follow-up was one month later. Sex (woman) and age (younger) were significant predictors of worse mental health only in college students without mental disorder background. Having any suicidal behavior background significantly predicted worse mental health in college students both with and without mental disorder history. Loneliness and region of residence were not statistically significant. In the between-groups comparisons, college students having mental disorder background had worse mental health than those without such a background. However, in the within-subject comparisons, no statistically significant changes occurred across time in the mental health of college students having mental disorder history. Conversely, significant changes occurred in those without such a background, but only when the interaction between time and quarantine duration was considered. Worsening mental health occurred during the most heavily restrictive quarantine phases, while some of the remissions occurred during the longest, but less restrictive ones.","Steinmetz, Fong, Godoy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110308","20210329","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental illness; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12486,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children's Health in Portugal: The Parental Perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for healthcare services and has led to changes in the usageÃ‚Â pattern of the pediatric population. We aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on children's health, wellbeing, and access to medical care in Portugal. We conducted a cross-sectional study through an anonymous online survey via social media. The collected data refers to a period between the 16th of March and the 17th of May 2020. We obtained responses to the survey on 19 745 children. Of the previously scheduled outpatient consultations, 54.2% wereÃ‚Â postponed by healthcare institutions and 21.6% of planned vaccinations were missed. Parents expressed concerns regarding psychological, social, and physical consequences for their children due to the pandemic. The observed reduction of pediatric emergency department visits and the postponement of outpatient consultations andÃ‚Â vaccine administrations are potentially harmful for non-COVID patients. The current pandemic and the imposed social distance mightÃ‚Â have an important negative impact on the mental health of children. Further studies are necessary to fully comprehend the outcomes of the decreased access to medical care, as well as theÃ‚Â collateral damage for children beyond the clinical aspects of the pandemic. Defining strategies regarding the urge to vaccinate children and not postpone urgent evaluations should be a public health priority.

"Psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak","Quarantine, although essential during contagious outbreaks, has been correlated with poor psychological outcomes in the general population. Such outcomes include low mood, suicide, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Studies have mostly looked at the mental health of general citizens, healthcare workers, or infected survivors, with limited research targeting university students. This study aimed to understand the psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak. Undergraduate students enrolled at the American University of Beirut were invited to participate in a 47-item online questionnaire. 73 participants completed the questionnaire. Demographic data, data about COVID-19 exposure, stressors during quarantine, understanding the rationale, compliance, and difficulties associated with quarantine, and levels of psychological distress were analysed. 75.3% of the participants were considered as having a high risk of developing acute stress. Undergoing quarantine for more than 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, having a chronic medical illness, inadequate access to supplies, and fear of infection were all significantly associated with an increased risk of acute stress. Despite being a necessary preventive measure during infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be associated with negative psychological effects, particularly in undergraduate students. Providing preventive and effective interventions is of utmost necessity.KEY POINTSDuring COVID-19, three-quarter of students had high risk for acute stress.Females had higher odds of high-risk acute stress compared to males.Having a chronic medical condition was associated with high risk acute stress.Long quarantine and lack of supplies were associated with high risk acute stress.Providing interventions to protect the mental health of students is necessary.","Kassir, El Hayek, Zalzale, Orsolini, Bizri","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2021.1900872","20210329","COVID-19; Lebanon; quarantine; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12488,""

"[The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the elderly mental health and psychosocial support]","The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is accompanied by psychosocial problems that have negative consequences for the mental health (MH) and quality of life (QoL) of the majority of the population. The elderly (65+ individuals) with chronic somatic diseases and reduced adaptation reserves are particularly at risk. In General, the epidemic highlighted the growing problems of psychosocial work with the 65+ cohort in the conditions of progressive aging of the population of many developed and developing countries. These problems are directly related to the preservation of MH and QoL of elderly people, people with disabilities, and others. Additional reserves should be sought to support these categories of individuals. In particular, the use of remote tele-consulting and assistive information technologies that enhance the communication capabilities of older persons is relevant. The article analyzes publications that offer practical recommendations for reducing the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on MH and QoL in a cohort of 65+ individuals. As a starting point of the discussion, the article by A.G.Golubev et al., in which the issues of public support for 65+ persons are considered to be the most relevant in the field of gerontology in the context of emergency response to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, is considered.

"The impact of COVID-19 on prenatal care in the United States: Qualitative analysis from a survey of 2519 pregnant women","To explore if and how women perceived their prenatal care to have changed as a result of COVID-19 and the impact of those changes on pregnant women. Qualitative analysis of open-ended prompts included as part of an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant women in the United States. Online survey with participants from 47 states within the U.S. Self-identified pregnant women recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources. An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Javaid, Barringer, Compton, Kaselitz, Muzik, Moyer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.102991","20210328","COVID-19; Pregnancy; perinatal mental health; prenatal care; reproductive health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12491,""
"Urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation, not COVID-19 case numbers by residence area, are associated with severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","Recent studies indicate an urgent need to take action against mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the association between larger-scale environmental factors such as living conditions and mental health problems during the pandemic is currently unknown. A nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in Japan between August and September 2020 to examine the association between urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation as living conditions and COVID-19 case numbers by prefecture. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for severe psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic were adjusted for potential confounders. Among 24,819 responses analyzed, the prevalence of mental health problems was 9.2% for severe psychological distress and 3.6% for new-onset suicidal ideation. PRs for severe psychological distress were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.30, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.08-1.56). PRs for new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.83, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.37-2.45) and greater neighborhood deprivation (highest PRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.35, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.06-1.72). Severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly more prevalent when there was higher urbanization plus lower neighborhood deprivation (PRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.34 [1.15-1.56], and 1.57 [1.22-2.03], respectively). These findings suggest that it is not the number of COVID-19 cases by residence area but higher urbanization level and greater neighborhood deprivation (lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status) that are associated with severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic. These findings differ in part from evidence obtained before the pandemic.","Okubo, Yoshioka, Nakaya, Hanibuchi, Okano, Ikezawa, Tsuno, Murayama, Tabuchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.028","20210328","COVID-19; Deprivation; Psychological distress; Suicidal ideation; Urbanization level","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12492,""
"Anxiety, depression, trauma-related, and sleep disorders among healthcare workers duirng the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Healthcare workers have been facing the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous critical patients and deaths, and high workloads. Quality of care is related to the mental status of healthcare workers. This PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis, on Pubmed/Psycinfo up to October 8, 2020, estimates the prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare workers during this pandemic. The systematic review included 70 studies (101 017 participants) and only high-quality studies were included in the meta-analysis. The following pooled prevalences were estimated: 30,0 % of anxiety (95%CI, 24.2 - 37.05); 31,1 % of depression (95%CI, 25.7 -36.8); 56,5% of acute stress (95%CI - 30.6 - 80.5); 20,2% of post-traumatic stress (95%CI, 9.9 - 33.0); 44.0 % of sleep disorders (95%CI, 24.6 - 64.5). The following factors were found to be sources of heterogeneity in subgroups and metaregressions analysis: proportion of female, nurses, and location. Targeted prevention and support strategies are needed now, and early in case of future health crises.","Marvaldi, Mallet, Dubertret, Moro, Guessoum","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.03.024","20210328","COVID-19; acute; anxiety; depression; healthcare workers; meta-analysis; psychological trauma; sleep wake disorders; stress disorders; systematic review; traumatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12493,""

"Doomscrolling during COVID-19: The negative association between daily social and traditional media consumption and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Consumption of traditional and social media markedly increased at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as new information about the virus and safety guidelines evolved. Much of the information concerned restrictions on daily living activities and the risk posed by the virus. The term ``doomscrolling'' was used to describe the phenomenon of elevated negative affect after viewing pandemic-related media. The magnitude and duration of this effect, however, is unclear. Furthermore, the effect of doomscrolling likely varies based on prior vulnerabilities for psychopathology such as a history of childhood maltreatment. It was hypothesized that social and traditional media exposure was related to an increase in depression and PTSD and that this increase was moderated by childhood maltreatment severity. Participants completed a baseline assessment for psychopathology and 30 days of daily assessments of depression and PTSD. Using multilevel modeling on 1,117 daily observations, social media access was associated with increased depression and PTSD. This association was stronger for those with more severe maltreatment histories. Furthermore, those with more severe baseline psychopathology used more social media during this period. These results suggest that doomscrolling is associated with increases in psychopathology for those with existing vulnerabilities.","Matthew Price et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46028-EE6-197","20210330","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; ptsd; ema; multilevel model; doomscrolling; covid-19; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","",12496,""
