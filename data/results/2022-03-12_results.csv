"Risk and protective factors associated with suicidal behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis amongst college students in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have increased suicidal behavior. The current study evaluates the patterns, risk and protective factors of suicidal behavior among college students in Spain (NÂ = 517) one year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, alcohol use and cannabis use (risk factors), and social support and COVID-19 fear (protective factors), were associated with suicidal behavior. These were relatively high among students (22.8% indicated a suicide risk and 9.7% have planned suicide), making it essential to have suicide prevention strategies for university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications for Social Work are discussed.

"Sociodemographic characteristics, preventive behaviors, and the mental health status of social work students in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic","Using data from a cross-sectional online survey among social work students (N =Â 457) in the US, our study explored differences in mental health status based on sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed disparate experiences related to anxiety, depression, self-harming thoughts, stress and hopelessness by age, gender, employment status, marital status, education, number of children, living arrangement, and mask-wearing and social distancing preventive behaviors. Findings provide implications to mitigate both the current and prolonged impact of the pandemic among social work students who will be playing crucial roles in the provision and delivery of health and human services.

"Risky alcohol consumption in older people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom","There has been little previous research within mental health services exploring changes in drinking behavior among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compared alcohol use and risky drinking both before and after lockdown in this age group. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to identify risky drinking in people aged between 55 and 74, in a sample of 366 people. One hundred and eighty-five people were referred before and one hundred and eighty-one people after lockdown in the UK. Compared with before lockdown, it was more likely for older people referred after lockdown to be female, have less severe cognitive impairment, and to show other features of alcohol-related harm such as morning drinking and feeling guilt or remorse over their drinking. These findings have implications for both access to services and service provision in older people who experience restrictions on their independence during a pandemic.","Rao, Rahul, Mueller, Christoph, Broadbent, Matthew","https://doi.org/10.1080/14659891.2021.1916851","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Substance Use; 27(2):212-217, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28363,""
"Active and passive social media usage and depression among the elderly during COVID-19: does race matter?","Increasing depression and mental health problems among the elderly during the pandemic have become a grave concern. In the present study, we borrowed from the emotional contagion theory and examined the association between social media use (SMU) and depression among the elderly during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that active but not passive SMU is positively related to depression. Moreover, we also examined if SMU (both active and passive) has a varying effect on the mental health of the elderly based on their race, i.e. blacks and whites. Our findings suggest that active SMU is detrimental for both blacks and whites, whereas passive SMU is positively related to depression only among blacks. Further, we undertook multiperiod analyses where depression scores were measured at four different time periods. We found that the adverse impact of SMU on depression persists over time. The present study draws attention to the antecedents of depression among the elderly during COVID-19. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

"Biosensors for the detection of disease outbreaks through Wastewater-based Epidemiology","Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a novel community-wide monitoring tool that provides comprehensive real-time data of the public and environmental health status and can contribute to public health interventions, including those related to infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic). Nonetheless, municipalities without centralized laboratories are likely still not able to process WBE samples. Biosensors are a potentially cost-effective solution to monitor the development of diseases through WBE to prevent local outbreaks. This review discusses the economic and technical feasibility of eighteen recently developed biosensors for the detection and monitoring of infectious disease agents in wastewater, prospecting the prevention of future pandemics.","JimÃ©nez-RodrÃ­guez, Mildred G.; Silva-Lance, Fernando, Parra-Arroyo, Lizeth, Medina-Salazar, D.

"Mental health of healthcare workers of Latin American countries: a review of studies published during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic","Objective Identify and review articles that evaluated mental health of HCW of Latin American countries (except Brazil), published during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic. Method We systematically searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, PUBMED/ Medline, Web of Science, PePSIC, and Scielo for articles published during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemics. Two independent researchers reviewed titles and s and then, for eligible studies, extracted data from full texts. Outcomes included mental health variables, country where the study was conducted, period of data collection, healthcare professional categories, study design, mental health measurements and main outcomes. The quality and risk assessment was also performed. Results Out of 248 records identified, 24 initially were assessed for eligibility. From those, 17 studies matched eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Higher scores of anxiety were reported in different studies, as well as an increased level of depression among HCW. Being a female, younger age, and closer distance of the epicenter of the outbreak increased the likelihood to develop mental health disorder. Concerns and fear related to COVID-19 have a greater impact on stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Conclusion Our findings highlight that COVID-19 pandemic had been worse for HCW from Latin America, showing the harmful effects of burnout on their health. Greater psychological distress, as well as anxiety and depression had been experienced by HCW from Latin America in their fight against COVID-19, demonstrating the importance of psychological well-being policies for them during and post- the pandemic.","Rosales-Vaca, Kimberly Massiel, Cruz-Barrientos, Oscar Ivan, GirÃ³n-LÃ³pez, Samara, Noriega, Sayra, More-Ãrias, Adriana, Guariente, Suzana Maria Menezes, Zazula, Robson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114501","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114501, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28368,""
"Les dispositifs groupaux Ã  lâ€™hÃ´pital et en EHPAD durant la crise de la COVID-19","RÃ©sumÃ© Introduction: La crise de la COVID-19 a exacerbÃ© la demande de dispositifs groupaux dÃ©diÃ©s aux soignants et aux personnels hospitaliers et mÃ©dicosociaux. Objectif: Cet article souhaite faire apparaÃ®tre, par la synthÃ¨se de multiples retours dâ€™expÃ©rience de dispositifs groupaux menÃ©s par des psychologues cliniciennes et chercheuses durant la pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19, les enjeux de lâ€™ouverture de dispositifs groupaux, entre offre et demande, ainsi que leurs principaux apports et limites organisationnels et psychologiques. MÃ©thode: Six chercheuses-cliniciennes se sont rÃ©unies pour Ã©changer sur leurs expÃ©riences vÃ©cues lors de la mise en place de dispositifs groupaux. Lâ€™analyse des retours dâ€™expÃ©rience sâ€™est faite au moyen des concepts de la psychodynamique du travail et de la psychanalyse des groupes, permettant de faire ressortir les caractÃ©ristiques organisationnelles et psychologiques des dispositifs groupaux dÃ©diÃ©s aux professionnels. RÃ©sultats: Nos rÃ©sultats mettent en Ã©vidence que le dispositif groupal, en permettant le partage des Ã©prouvÃ©s, aide la reconnaissance mutuelle entre professionnels, et donc de nouvelles identifications afin dâ€™Ã©viter la fragmentation des collectifs de travail. Le point le plus central semble Ãªtre la capacitÃ© des dispositifs de groupe Ã  traiter lâ€™agressivitÃ© et la colÃ¨re ressenties face Ã  lâ€™impuissance Ã  agir dans des situations de crise. Les limites de ces groupes concernent leur difficultÃ© Ã  laisser sâ€™exprimer des paroles individuelles plutÃ´t que collectives, et le risque dâ€™Ãªtre le terrain dâ€™une rÃ©pÃ©tition du trauma pour les professionnels qui attaquent ou fuient parfois ces dispositifs, par peur de ce quâ€™ils pourraient faire ressurgir. Conclusion: Plusieurs points de vigilance et prÃ©conisations des expÃ©riences rapportÃ©es dans cet article sont explicitÃ©s, afin dâ€™Ã©clairer et guider les futurs meneurs de dispositifs de groupe construits avec et pour les professionnels du champ sanitaire. Introduction: The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the demand for group arrangements dedicated to healthcare professionals and more widely hospital and medicosocial staff. Objective: This article attempts to shhed light on the issues at stake in the opening of group settings, between supply and demand, as well as their main organizational and psychological contributions and limitations, through the synthesis of multiple feedbacks from group arrangements carried out by clinical psychologists and researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Six female researcher-clinicians met to discuss their experiences in setting up group care facilities. The analysis of the feedback used the concepts of work psychodynamics and group psychoanalysis, making it possible to bring out the organizational and psychological characteristics of group arrangements dedicated to professionals in the healthcare sector. Results: Our results show that the group arrangement, by allowing the sharing of experiences, helps the mutual recognition between professionals, and thus new identifications in order to avoid the fragmentation of work collectives. The most central point seems to be the capacity of group arrangements to deal with the aggressiveness and anger felt when facing the powerlessness to act in crisis situations. The limits of these groups concern their difficulty in allowing individual rather than collective words to be expressed, and the risk of being the site of a repetition of the trauma for the professionals who sometimes attack or flee from these mechanisms, for fear of what they might bring back to the surface. Conclusion: Several points of vigilance and recommendations from the experiences reported in this article are explained, in order to enlighten and guide future group facilitators when offering group arrangements built with and for professionals in the healthcare field.","Haliday, HÃ©loÃ¯se, Bonnet, Magali, Poujol, Anne-Laure, Masselin-Dubois, Anne, Deltour, Victoire, Nguyen, StÃ©phanie, Landbeck, Alicia, Fournier, Alicia, Laurent, Alexandra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prps.2022.02.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pratiques Psychologiques;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28369,""
"Trajectories of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in a population-based sample of middle-aged and older adults","The COVID-19 pandemic and the related governmental restrictions have greatly impacted the lives of people worldwide and have been suggested to negatively impact mental health. We describe the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic and their determinants in a large population-based sample of middle-aged and older adults. From April to June 2020, participants of the Rotterdam Study were asked to complete questionnaires including questions on depressive symptoms (Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, 10 item version) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, anxiety subscale). We compared depressive and anxiety symptom scores to those before the pandemic and described its trajectories during the pandemic by demographic variables, chronic disease status and pre-pandemic clinically relevant depressive or anxiety symptoms. In total, 6241 participants responded to the questionnaires (mean age [standard deviation] 70.1 years [11.6];58% women). Participants reported clinically relevant depressive symptoms more often during than before the pandemic (19% vs. 12%, PÂ &lt;Â .001), which was similar for clinically relevant anxiety symptoms (17% vs. 12%, PÂ &lt;Â .001). During the pandemic, depressive symptoms persisted over time while anxiety symptoms improved. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were more common among women, persons living alone, with chronic diseases and with pre-pandemic clinically relevant symptoms, although the trajectories of these symptoms over time were broadly similar for the subgroups. Together, these results suggest that it is important to be aware of long-term depressive symptoms following the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population.","Mooldijk, Sanne S.; Dommershuijsen, Lisanne J.; de Feijter, Maud, Luik, Annemarie I.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28370,""
"The impact of the initial and second national COVID-19 lockdowns on mental health in young people with and without pre-existing depressive symptoms","Background The evidence on mental health during COVID-19 evolved fast, but still little is known about the long-lasting impact of the sequential lockdowns. We examine changes in young people's mental health from before to during the initial and second more prolonged lockdown, and whether women and those with pre-existing depressive symptoms were disproportionally impacted. Methods Participants reported on mental health indicators in an ongoing 18-year data collection in the Danish National Birth Cohort and in a COVID-19 survey, including 8 data points: 7 in the initial lockdown, and 1 year post. Changes in quality of life (QoL), mental well-being, and loneliness were estimated with random effect linear regressions on longitudinal data (NÂ =Â 32,985), and linear regressions on repeated cross-sections (NÂ =Â 28,579). Findings Interim deterioration in mental well-being and loneliness was observed during the initial lockdown, and only in those without pre-existing depressive symptoms. During the second lockdown, a modest deterioration was again observed for mental well-being and loneliness. QoL likewise only declined among those without pre-existing symptoms, where women showed a greater decline than men. QoL did not normalise during the initial lockdown and remained at lower levels during the second lockdown. These findings were not replicated in the repeated cross-sections. Interpretation Except for an interim decrease in mental health, and only in those without pre-existing depressive symptoms, this study's findings do not suggest a substantial detrimental impact of the lockdowns.","Joensen, Andrea, Danielsen, Stine, Andersen, Per Kragh, Groot, Jonathan, Strandberg-Larsen, Katrine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28371,""

There is a lack of French data. The principal aim was to assess French medical students' mental health. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was performed between May 27 and June 27, 2021. An anonymous questionnaire was sent via academic email addresses by medical faculties and secondly on social media. We assessed 7-day anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Hospitalization Anxiety and Depression scale, 12-month major depressive episode (MDE) with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview- Short Form, burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 12-month suicidal ideation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and sexual aggression during their curriculum. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify main MDE associated factors. Outcomes 11,754 participants (response rate: 15.3%) were included. Prevalence of 7-day anxiety symptoms, 7-day depressive symptoms, 12-month MDE, and 12-month suicidal thoughts were 52%, 18%, 25%, and 19% respectively. Burnout syndrome concerned 67% of clinical students and residents and 39% of preclinical students.

"A scoping review of COVID-19-related stress coping resources among nurses","Objective The entire mental health hazard among the nurses dealing with COVID-19 is just the tip of the iceberg. The goal of this study was to find acceptable and adaptive coping techniques for nurses in order to keep the healthcare system resilient during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Method The scoping review search took place from January 2020 to May 2021 published articles, and the results were saved in Endnote software. For data synthesis and review, the Joanna Briggs Institute manual and PRISMA-ScR principles were followed. Following backward and forward screening to exclude redundant, irrelevant, and ineligible studies, 13 studies (3,613 nurses) were finally selected for this review. Results The majorities of participants in these studies were female and had children, and worked in departments of critical care, emergency, and fever clinics. Safety concerns for family or colleagues, as well as a lack of safe working environment, were the primary causes of the mental illness. Professional responsibility attitude, COVID-19 training, workplace safety, team spirit, and a few relaxation activities such as deep breathing, reading books, watching movies, and praying, on the other hand, were found to be beneficial for stress coping among nurses. Conclusion Mentally fit nurses are more capable and flexible in the face of any life-threatening outbreak, even if it is very contagious.

"Visitor satisfaction and behavioral intentions in nature-based tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study from Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, China","Nature-based tourism (NBT) has become a popular tool for developing countries to achieve economic growth by the non-destructive use of their natural resources. COVID-19 has caused severe financial impacts on tourism-dependent areas. Revitalizing NBT is needed for economic recovery in those regions and can also help deal with mental health issues worldwide. Zhangjiajie National Forest Park (ZNFP), the first national park created in China, was selected to examine the important factors that influence visitor satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationship between satisfaction and visitors' environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) intention. The authors collected 788 onsite and online questionnaires from visitors to ZNFP during Juneâ€“September 2020. This paper reveals previously underestimated factors and offers practical applications for park development at ZNFP and other NBT destinations. Visitors had a high level of satisfaction with the natural scenery of the park but were relatively dissatisfied with price reasonableness, park services, activities and events, and artificial attractions. Younger visitors, especially students, and well-educated visitors looking for environmental education opportunities tended to have lower satisfaction rates. Visitor satisfaction may have a positive but limited influence on promoting visitors' ERB intentions. We propose group-specific strategies for national park managers to attract more visitors and increase their length of stay.","Cheng, Yuqing, Hu, Fangbing, Wang, Guibin, Innes, John L.; Xie, Yiping, Wang, Guangyu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgeop.2022.03.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Geoheritage and Parks;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28374,""
"Update of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: Present experience and outlook for the future","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTS) has become a recognised clinical entity since the Japanese scientist Sato first described it in 1990. Despite an increasing number of confirmed cases, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and decision-making differs in the diagnosis and treatment. In addition, it is not evident whether a significant increase in TTS is due to better understanding among practitioners and widespread access to coronary angiography, or if it is a reflection of an actual increase in incidence. We analysed a series of international research studies from 1990 to 2021. Beyond epidemiology and clinical presentation, we evaluated and summarised fundamental knowledge about various predisposing factors, with particular attention to the iatrogenic impact of certain drugs, namely antidepressants, chemotherapy, and antiarrhythmics. Furthermore, we highlighted the main pathophysiological theories to date. In addition, based on published studies and clinical cases, we investigated the role of numerous diagnostic approaches in the differential diagnosis of TTS and identified predictors of TTS complications, such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular fibrillation, and left ventricular thrombi. Accordingly, we sought to propose a diagnostic algorithm and further treatment management of TTS under the presence of possible complications to help practitioners make more informed decisions, as the initial presentation continues to pose a challenge due to its close similarity to acute coronary syndrome with ST-elevation. In conclusion, this article examines Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from different perspectives and, along with future systematic reviews and meta-analyses, can be of particular interest to practising cardiologists and researchers in developing clinical guidelines.","Bairashevskaia, Anastasiia V.; Belogubova, Sofiya Y.; Kondratiuk, Mikhail R.; Rudnova, Daria S.; Sologova, Susanna S.; Tereshkina, Olga I.; Avakyan, Esma I.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcha.2022.100990","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: IJC Heart & Vasculature; 39:100990, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28375,""
"The role of current transport expenditure in mitigating the risk of modal shift during Covid-19 â€“ lessons from Polish cities","This article shows that current expenditure allocated by local authorities for the routine maintenance of public transport (i.e., providing passengers with clean and frequent services) is crucial to effectively limit the modal shift from public transit to private cars during the Covid-19 pandemic. In our analysis, we define public transport as the bus, tram, metro and trolley operations which are ordered and funded by 11 local authorities in Poland;we also assume that the modal shift is reflected in the growth of traffic congestion. Taking into account these assumptions and considering the long-term financial data from 2010 to 2020, we then conduct hierarchical linear regression and state that cities with a higher share of current expenses in citiesâ€™ total annual transport expenditure have registered during the pandemic a lower number of weeks with congestion level exceeding the pre-pandemic level. We argue that this is due to the allocation of current expenditure to cleaning services and the transport service supply, which could have a significant impact on perceptions of crowding and safety on public transport. Both issues belong to the essential determinants of the quality of public transport services and could play a key role in mitigating the modal shift by reducing the fear of catching Covid-19. In contrast to this finding, we also show that investment expenditure (allocated to improvements of transport infrastructure) does not have a similar impact on the congestion during the pandemic. In this context, we emphasise that cutting spending on cleaning services and the transport supply service as a response to the reduced number of passengers would be more devastating for public transport than postponing new infrastructure investments. Based on the results achieved in the analysis, we provide recommendations for local authorities that can help implement new funding models and reframe local transport policy, namely: (1) close the funding gap resulting from lower revenues to local budgets, (2) provide resources for maintaining the infrastructure investments and adapting them to a â€œnew normalityâ€, (3) maintain the attractiveness of public transport post-Covid.","Krysinski, Dawid, Uss-Lik, Aneta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cstp.2022.03.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Case Studies on Transport Policy;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28376,""
"Sleeplessness in COVID-19 Pandemic: Lockdown and Anxiety","This paper investigates the sleeplessness in Chinese cities during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We provide first evidence of a link from daily COVID-19 cases resulting in sleep loss in a panel of Chinese cities. We use Wuhan, which was the first city to be completely locked down, as basis to present the result that sleeplessness has become a considerably serious issue owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. In using the intervention policy of various cities as exogenous shocks, we find that lockdown policies significantly increase the sleeplessness level of Chinese cities. In addition, the severity of COVID-19 pandemic significantly exacerbates the negative effect of lockdown policies on sleep quality in the city. Overall, this study indicate that policy makers should pay more attention to public mental health when citizens recover from COIVD-19 by investigating the unintended consequences of COVID-19 on sleeplessness level of cities.","Kong, Gaowen, Kong, Dongmin, Shi, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101460","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Asian Economics;: 101460, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28377,""
"Mental health in the post-lockdown pandemic phase: Relief or exacerbation of psychological distress? A cross-sectional study in the general population in Italy","This study is one of the first aiming at investigating the mental health in the post-lockdown period in an Italian adult population and detecting demographic and psychological predictors for a worse outcome. 1401 participants answered a web-based survey including the Emotional Reaction Questionnaire (ERQ), the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS). Simple slope analyses highlighted that women, lower age, and suppression were related to higher scores for the PANAS negative affect scale, the DASS-21, the IES-R, the GHQ, and the DUWAS. In our sample, 1.2% of participants showed depressive symptoms, 0.5% anxiety symptoms, and 2% stress symptoms. Moreover, 5.4% of participants reported post-traumatic symptoms and 15% signs of psychological distress. Compared with data on the lockdown period, our results show lower levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, possibly due to the slackening of preventive measures adopted since June. Despite this, post-traumatic symptoms and signs of psychological distress were still present. Our data suggest the necessity to monitor psychological adaption over time in general and at-risk subjects.","Orfei, Maria Donata, Bossi, Francesco, D'Arcangelo, Sonia, Maggi, Francesca, Lattanzi, Nicola, Malizia, Andrea Patricelli, Ricciardi, Emiliano","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103555","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Acta Psychologica; 225:103555, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28378,""
"Depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal behavior among Bangladeshi undergraduate rehabilitation students: An observational study amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","Background and Aims Common mental health symptoms (CMHS) like depressive moods, anxiety, and stress are the underlying causes of suicidal behavior. The incidence of suicide is higher among Bangladeshi students. Due to the pandemic, students of health/rehabilitation sciences are at the most significant risk. This study aimed to measure the prevalence rate and predicting factors for depression, anxiety and stress, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts in Bangladeshi undergraduate rehabilitation students. Methods This cross-sectional study included data from 731 participants. Descriptive analyses estimated prevalence, and multivariate logistic regression models identified the factors associated with CMHS and suicidal behavior after adjusting the confounders. Results The result shows a high prevalence of moderate to very severe CMHS and a higher risk of suicidal ideation among rehabilitation students. Sociodemographic factors, illness, behavior, institution, and subject-related issues were identified as the predicting factors of CMHS and suicidal behavior. The students suffering from mental health symptoms reported suicidal ideation and attempted at a significantly higher rate. Conclusion To deal with CHMS and suicide risk, a holistic, supportive approach from government and academic institutions are essential for minimizing the predicting factors identified by this study. The study is helpful for the government regulatory body and policymakers to take immediate steps for preventing CMHS and suicidal behavior among rehabilitation students in Bangladesh.","Ali, Mohammad, Uddin, Zakir, Amran Hossain, Kazi M.; Uddin, Turjo R.","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.549","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Science Reports; 5(2):e549, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28379,""

"Artificial Intelligence to Combat the Sting of the Pandemic on the Psychological Realms of Human Brain","We are inhabitants of the universe in this anomalous time due to the novel corona virus. COVID-19, which WHO has annotated as a pandemic, is an infectious and contagious disease hastened by the most freshly perceived coronavirus. COVID-19 has gravely hit different people in different ways, some with physical symptoms and some patients will likely be more susceptible to insignificant and extreme symptoms of mental illness. Such patients often with pre-existing mobility limitations get imprisoned in their own homes. The current pandemic beseeches for intense contemplation of the mental health of patients to reduce their worry and heal their fear, depression and anxiety due to quarantine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is more and more remarkable in public, academic, and clinical provinces.

"Addressing Transportation Barriers to Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives of Care Coordinators","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation barriers prevented millions of Americans from accessing needed medical care. Then the pandemic disrupted medical and transportation systems across the globe. This research explored ways the COVID-19 pandemic changed how people experienced transportation barriers to accessing health care. We conducted in-depth interviews with social workers, nurses, and other care coordinators in North Carolina to identify barriers to traveling for medical care during the pandemic and explore innovative solutions employed to address these barriers. Analyzing these interviews using a flexible coding approach, we found that the pandemic exacerbated existing transportation barriers and created new barriers. Yet, simultaneously, temporary policy responses expanded the utilization of telehealth. The interviews identified specific advantages of expanded telehealth, including increasing access to mental health services in rural areas, reducing COVID-19 exposure for high-risk patients, and offering continuity of care for COVID-19 patients with other health conditions. While telehealth cannot address all medical needs, such as emergency or cancer care, it may be well-suited for preliminary screenings and follow-up visits. The findings provide insights on how post-pandemic telehealth policy changes can benefit individuals facing transportation barriers to accessing health care and support more accommodating and convenient health care for patients and their families.","Oluyede, Lindsay, Cochran, Abigail L.; Wolfe, Mary, Prunkl, Lauren, McDonald, Noreen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+Transportation+Barriers+to+Health+Care+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Perspectives+of+Care+Coordinators","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Transportation research.

"Exploring the mechanisms behind HIV drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa: conceptual mapping of a complex adaptive system based on multi-disciplinary expert insights","Background HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) continues to threaten the effectiveness of worldwide antiretroviral therapy (ART). Emergence and transmission of HIVDR are driven by several interconnected factors. Though much has been done to uncover factors influencing HIVDR, overall interconnectedness between these factors remains unclear and African policy makers encounter difficulties setting priorities combating HIVDR. By viewing HIVDR as a complex adaptive system, through the eyes of multi-disciplinary HIVDR experts, we aimed to make a first attempt to linking different influencing factors and gaining a deeper understanding of the complexity of the system. Methods We designed a detailed systems map of factors influencing HIVDR based on semi-structured interviews with 15 international HIVDR experts from or with experience in sub-Saharan Africa, from different disciplinary backgrounds and affiliated with different types of institutions. The resulting detailed system map was conceptualized into three main HIVDR feedback loops and further strengthened with literature evidence. Results Factors influencing HIVDR in sub-Saharan Africa and their interactions were sorted in five categories: biology, individual, social context, healthcare system and â€˜overarchingâ€™. We identified three causal loops cross-cutting these layers, which relate to three interconnected subsystems of mechanisms influencing HIVDR. The â€˜adherence motivationâ€™ subsystem concerns the interplay of factors influencing people living with HIV to alternate between adherence and non-adherence. The â€˜healthcare burdenâ€™ subsystem is a reinforcing loop leading to an increase in HIVDR at local population level. The â€˜ART overrelianceâ€™ subsystem is a balancing feedback loop leading to complacency among program managers when there is overreliance on ART with a perceived low risk to drug resistance. The three subsystems are interconnected at different levels. Conclusions Interconnectedness of the three subsystems underlines the need to act on the entire system of factors surrounding HIVDR in sub-Saharan Africa in order to target interventions and to prevent unwanted effects on other parts of the system. The three theories that emerged while studying HIVDR as a complex adaptive system form a starting point for further qualitative and quantitative investigation.

Serious psychological distress includes mental health problems severe enough to cause moderate-to-serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning;and to require treatment.5 Other key findings related to psychological distress include the following: * Incidences of NSPD have nearly doubled since 2018 (16% in 2018). * 57% of respondents perceived increases in psychological distress in the month prior to the survey, indicating that negative effects on mental health are still accumulating approximately a year after the COVID-19 pandemic started. * Respondents reported that feelings associated with psychological distress affected their ability to work four days per month on average. For reference, feelings of positive effect are attributed to the following sentiments: * daily life full of things that are interesting to the respondent * feeling calm, peaceful, cheerful, or light-hearted * relating to the sentiment of being a generally happy person Next Steps With the participation of other related professions, the report is intended to be followed by an account of mental health status with allied health professionals included in the joint research project.","Djukic, Brandon BSc PhD Researcher Csmls","https://www.google.com/search?q=MENTAL+HEALTH+SURVEY:+TAKING+STOCK+OF+YOUR+HEALTH","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Medical Laboratory Science; 83(4):30-32, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28390,""
"Substance use during COVID-19 pandemic: impact on the underserved communities","The number of overdose deaths are on the rise all over the world. An estimate of 93,000 drug overdose deaths have been estimated in the United States in 2020. COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the drug crisis. Factors, such as existing health disparities among underserved communities, lack of resources for people of color, lack of belief in available resources, social isolation and economic burden, limited access to treatment, regulatory barriers in telehealth, and stress from the on-going COVID-19 pandemic have been identified as some of the key factors behind the acute health effects of people with substance use disorder. These interrelated factors exacerbate the impact of already existing disparities in the underserved communities. Policy and regulatory changes around telehealth and access of treatment for substance use disorder are warranted. Evidence-based strategies and other safer drug practices should be implemented to mitigate the impact on human health. Investment in programs that increase access to treatment, will be useful for potential future pandemics, where increasing mental health services and overall access to healthcare in disadvantaged communities would lessen the disparities in physical and mental ailments. In this review, we are evaluating and summarizing the acute health effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with substance use disorder.","Chacon, Natalia C.; Walia, Namrata, Allen, Abigail, Sciancalepore, Anthony, Tiong, Joyce, Quick, Rachel, Mada, Sanjana, Diaz, Miguel A.; Rodriguez, Ivan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Substance+use+during+COVID-19+pandemic:+impact+on+the+underserved+communities","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Discoveries (Craiova, Romania); 9(4), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28391,""
"COVID-19: The Urgency of Engaging during Crisis","IMPACT: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the UTMB Institute for Translational Sciences has sought to answer our communitiesâ€™ needs for research, for knowledge of research, and involvement in research, while recognizing that meaningful engagement involves understanding all emergent needs and responding to maximize the health and well-being of those we serve. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: ITS community programs responsive to COVID-19 include: <U+03BF> Ongoing communication with community and business stakeholders <U+03BF> Social media and public health campaigns promoting safe practices, research updates, and testing information <U+03BF> Community initiatives to increase testing among vulnerable populations METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Like sister hubs across the US, the UTMB ITS has brought available resources to bear on addressing COVID-19 through research, medical response, and public health outreach. Community engagement activities have included facilitating communication, particularly by rapidly translating information for multiple audiences and wherever possible and appropriate, providing opportunities for the patientâ€™s voice to inform and guide development of research. We realized the communityâ€™s need for trustworthy and reliable information about COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Key partnerships with community members and organizations were critical in enabling us all to be most responsive in meeting these needs. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: ITS community outreach included developing infographics, media notices, and educational materials related to prevention and testing as well as appropriate use of PPE. These efforts resulted in an article in a regional newspaper, which was disseminated widely through social media networks. ITS faculty also engaged doctoral and MPH trainees to support the Health Districtâ€™s contact tracing effort. We held several events on mental health impacts as well as discussions related to health disparities. Both activities shaped plans for community-based interventions and research. The ITS also hosted a virtual workshop to facilitate discussion around key research questions related to the pandemic. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Throughout the pandemic, the ITS has maintained contact with stakeholders. Our roles have been to communicate, disseminate, translate, provide resources, and build bridges. We also listen, share, and provide opportunities for patients and communities to engage in all phases of the research spectrum.","Bohn, Krista, Croisant, Sharon, Hallberg, Lance, Prochaska, John, Singleton, Chantele","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19:+The+Urgency+of+Engaging+during+Crisis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of clinical and translational science; 5(Suppl 1):74-74, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28392,""
"The Impact Of The COVID-19 Pandemic On Sexual Health In Cis Women Living In Germany","Background : Preliminary research shows a substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's sexual health, whereby empirical work on sexual well-being of minoritized sexual identities is still rare. Aim : The objective of this study was to explore sexual health in heterosexual, lesbian and bisexual cis women during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Methods : An anonymous nationwide online survey was conducted among cis women during the first nationwide lockdown in Germany from April 20th to July 20th, 2020. The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, online chats and social-media platforms. Main Outcome Measures : Demographic variables and self-report measures from the Sexual Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ-G) ""before the pandemic"" and ""since the pandemic"" were collected. Results : A total of 1368 cis women participants were included: heterosexual women (nÂ =Â 844), lesbian women (nÂ =Â 293), bisexual women (nÂ =Â 231). Results indicate overall decrease in frequency of sexual contacts and masturbation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding differences before and during the pandemic lesbian women showed significant changes in sexual arousal whereas heterosexual women showed significant changes in all dimensions except capability to enjoy sexual intercourse. The data of bisexual women showed significant changes in almost all dimensions except for frequency of sexual intercourse and sexual arousal. Results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that being younger than 36 years-old, and being in a relationship as well as being heterosexual (compared with being lesbian) is positively associated with general satisfaction with sexual life during the pandemic. Clinical Implications : The findings suggest that during a pandemic sexual and mental health care for (cis) women should be provided and address the specific needs of sexual minority groups. Strengths & Limitations : This is the first study to describe sexual behavior in heterosexual, lesbian and bisexual women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Limitations, however, include the fact that the data described were obtained at only one time point so there is a possibility of recall bias, and that the results cannot be generalized because of the underrepresentation of women over age 46. Conclusion : This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social constraints on the sexual health of particular groups of lesbian and bisexual women, which may improve preparedness for future public health and policy crises.","Batz, Falk, Lermer, Eva, Hatzler, Laura, Vilsmaier, Theresa, SchrÃ¶der, Lennard, Chelariu-Raicu, Anca, Behr, Joachim, Mahner, Sven, Buspavanich, Pichit, Thaler, Christian J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+Of+The+COVID-19+Pandemic+On+Sexual+Health+In+Cis+Women+Living+In+Germany","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The journal of sexual medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28393,""
"Azithromycin Misuse During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study from Jordan","Objective Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a global pandemic, repurposing known drugs was the quickest way to combat the disease. The initial screening revealed that azithromycin (AZM) might have potential against COVID-19. Although clinical trials did not prove such efficacy, many countries have put AZM within their guidelines for treating COVID-19. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the misuse of AZM in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Results A cross-sectional study was conducted among community pharmacies in Jordan from March 27 to May 8, 2021, and 184 pharmacies data were collected from the Google forms. During COVID-19, 42.9% of pharmacies sold more than 20 packs of prescribed AZM per month compared to 46.7% of pharmacies used to sell 0â€“5 packs AZM prescriptions per month before the pandemic. During COVID-19, pharmacists significantly dispensed AZM with and without prescriptions 107% and 127%, respectively, more than before the pandemic (p &lt; 0.0001). Overall, pharmacists stocked 121% more AZM packs during COVID-19 than before the pandemic (p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, most pharmacists (59.7%) believed that AZM could cure COVID-19 patients. However, using multinomial logistic regression analysis, low-experienced pharmacists were unsure if AZM could positively affect COVID-19 patients (p &lt; 0.05, OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 1.23â€“11.52). Furthermore, low-experienced pharmacists believed that increased use of AZM for the treatment of viral infections could lead to negative consequences (p &lt; 0.001, OR = 0.161, 95% CI 0.063â€“0.414). Conclusion This study demonstrated that AZM is misused by physicians, pharmacists, and the public in Jordan. Since AZM efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 is scarce, there is a need for new guidelines by governmental health authorities to implement strict enforcement of AZM dispensing during COVID-19 to avoid negative consequences of bacterial resistance.","Abdelmalek, Suzanne M.

"Occupational Risk Factors and Mental Health Among Frontline Health Care Workers in a Large US Metropolitan Area During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To assess depression, anxiety, and burnout among health care workers using well-established validated scales and to examine associations of these mental health outcomes with personal protective equipment (PPE) and high-risk patient contact. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This prospective survey was conducted between August and October 2020 among 970 essential health care workers from 2 health systems in central Texas. The survey captured basic demographic, occupational, and baseline health information including history of mental health disorders. Depression, anxiety, and burnout were assessed with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and 23-item Burnout Assessment Tool. Questions about clinical contact with patients with suspected or known COVID-19 were also incorporated. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Approximately 24% of respondents had moderate or severe anxiety, 14% had moderate or severe depression, and 7% were at high risk for burnout. Statistically significant associations were found between perceived PPE adequacy and the 3 mental health outcomes, while accounting for age, gender, and education. Hours of contact with COVID-19 patients during aerosolizing procedures was positively correlated with measures of anxiety, burnout, and depression after adjustment for age, gender, and occupational role. Perception of PPE adequacy was inversely correlated with measures of depression, anxiety, and burnout among essential members of 2 health care systems, whose roles precluded working remotely during the pandemic. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This study highlights the correlations of perceptions of PPE adequacy and contact hours with COVID-19 patients undergoing aerosolizing procedures and employee mental well-being. Future work confirming the findings can help identify ways that systems can support their employees through similarly stressful and demanding events.","Cahill, Olshavsky, Newport, Benzer, Chambers, Custer, Rathouz, Nutt, Jwaied, Leslie, Matsui","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.21m03166","20220311","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28395,""
"Applying the Health Belief Model to Characterize Racial/Ethnic Differences in Digital Conversations Related to Depression Pre- and Mid-COVID-19","The prevalence of depression in the United States is &gt;3 times higher mid-COVID-19 versus pre-pandemic. Racial/ethnic differences in mindsets around depression and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are not well characterized. To describe attitudes, mindsets, key drivers, and barriers related to depression pre- and mid-COVID-19 by race/ethnicity using digital conversations about depression mapped to health belief model (HBM) concepts. Advanced search, data extraction, and AI-powered tools were used to harvest, mine, and structure open-source digital conversations of US adults who engaged in conversations about depression pre- (February 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and mid-COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020-November 1, 2020) across the internet. Natural language processing, text analytics, and social data mining were used to categorize conversations that included a self-identifier into racial/ethnic groups. Conversations were mapped to HBM concepts (ie, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy). Results are descriptive in nature. Of 2.9 and 1.3 million relevant digital conversations pre- and mid-COVID-19, race/ethnicity was determined among 1.8 million and 979,000 conversations, respectively. Pre-COVID-19, 1.3 million conversations about depression were analyzed among non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), 227,200 among Black Americans (BA), 189,200 among Hispanics, and 86,800 among Asian Americans (AS). Mid-COVID-19, a total of 736,100 conversations about depression were analyzed among NHW, 131,800 among BA, 78,300 among Hispanics, and 32,800 among AS. Conversations among all racial/ethnic groups had a negative tone, which increased pre- to mid-COVID-19; finding support from others was seen as a benefit among most groups. Hispanics had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group of conversations showing an avoidant mindset toward their depression. Conversations related to external barriers to seeking treatment (eg, stigma, lack of support, and lack of resources) were generally more prevalent among Hispanics, BA, and AS than among NHW. Being able to benefit others and building a support system were key drivers to seeking help or treatment for all racial/ethnic groups. There were considerable racial/ethnic differences in drivers and barriers to seeking help and treatment for depression pre- and mid-COVID-19. As expected, COVID-19 has made conversations about depression more negative, and with frequent discussions of barriers to seeking care. Applying concepts of the HBM to data on digital conversation about depression allowed organization of the most frequent themes by race/ethnicity. Individuals of all groups came online to discuss their depression. These data highlight opportunities for culturally competent and targeted approaches to address areas amenable to change that might impact the ability of people to ask for or receive mental health help, such as the constructs that comprise the HBM.","Castilla-Puentes, Pesa, Brethenoux, Furey, Valletta, Falcone","https://doi.org/10.2196/33637","20220311","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28396,""
"Effects of COVID-19 Mental Health Interventions Among Children, Adolescents, and Adults Not Quarantined or Undergoing Treatment Due to COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review of Randomised Controlled Trials","Our objective was to assess the effects of mental health interventions for children, adolescents, and adults not quarantined or undergoing treatment due to COVID-19 infection. We searched 9 databases (2 Chinese-language) from December 31, 2019, to March 22, 2021. We included randomised controlled trials of interventions to address COVID-19 mental health challenges among people not hospitalised or quarantined due to COVID-19 infection. We synthesized results descriptively due to substantial heterogeneity of populations and interventions and risk of bias concerns. We identified 9 eligible trials, including 3 well-conducted, well-reported trials that tested interventions designed specifically for COVID-19 mental health challenges, plus 6 other trials with high risk of bias and reporting concerns, all of which tested standard interventions (e.g., individual or group therapy, expressive writing, mindfulness recordings) minimally adapted or not specifically adapted for COVID-19. Among the 3 well-conducted and reported trials, 1 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°670) found that a self-guided, internet-based cognitive-behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry significantly reduced COVID-19 anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.90) and depression symptoms (SMD 0.38, 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.55) in Swedish general population participants.

"Predictor variables of mental health in the Spanish population confined by COVID-19","Drastic changes in the lifestyle of individuals have been caused by coronarivus SARS-CoV-2 with lethal effects associated with COVID-19, which acts as a stressor for the population with adverse effects on mental health status. The aim was to identify which sociodemographic variables and psychological factors predict psychological disorders in the general Spanish population. The sample consisted of 699 people exposed to a confinement situation, where 402 (57.51%) were women and 297 (42.49%) were men, between 18 and 73 years old (MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 27.79; SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 12.68). Different sociodemographic and psychological variables were assessed to see if they predicted levels of anxiety and depression. The results identify the predictive capacity of some sociodemographic risk variables such as sex (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .144; IC95%Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.341-3.376) and living with people who are ill with COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .088; IC95%Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.157-6.785), as well as protective factors such as self-efficacy (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -.126; IC95%Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.282-0.066) and hope (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -.429; IC95%Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.591-0.408) in mental health. In predicting anxiety levels, self-efficacy and hope are protective factors, especially when living with people in essential services.

"Major Impact of Coping Styles on Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Healthcare Workers During the Outbreak of COVID-19","In the early days of COVID-19 outbreak, the normally orderly health system was severely challenged by large numbers of feverish patients and shortage of healthcare workers. The outbreak played a harmful role in the mental health of these healthcare workers. We aim to assess the prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety and depression symptoms (ADSs) of healthcare workers in different regions during COVID-19 disaster and identify the potential risk factors. We did a cross-sectional study on ADS of healthcare workers in epicenter-Hubei province and regions in lower epidemic-other provinces by questionnaire online. The data of ADS, the demographic characteristics, occupational exposure, physical condition, family situation, and coping styles were collected and analyzed. A total of 24.68% of the respondents had experienced moderate or severe ADS. Moderate or severe ADSs were in a higher prevalence in Hubei (32.39%) than other provinces (18.22%). Suspicious symptoms on their own and in family members were independent risk factors of moderate or severe ADS of all health workers. Working on the frontline was the independent risk factor for participants in Hubei province, whereas quarantine was the independent risk factor for those in other provinces. Moreover, among all participants, those with negative coping style were more than four times more likely to have moderate or severe ADS than those with positive coping style. Moderate or severe ADSs were in a higher prevalence in healthcare workers of Hubei province during COVID-19 outbreak.

"Interventional Response of Hospital and Health Services to the Mental Health Effects of Viral Outbreaks on Health Professionals","The aim of this integrative review was to examine the impact of past viral epidemics on staff mental health interventional responses, with a specific focus on healthcare provider response in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following PRISMA methodology, databases were searched for relevant articles. A total of 55 articles with a range of methodologies (e.g., commentary papers, cohort studies, qualitative studies) were included to ensure broad coverage of this rapidly emerging research area. The literature showed that many healthcare providers implemented a variety of wellbeing initiatives to support their staff during a viral outbreak. Most of these interventions, however, were not formally evaluated. Interventions included leadership/team support; online psychoeducational resources and updated information on the pandemic; respite spaces; peer support outreach; staff resilience training; telephone hotline support; staff support groups; and individual counseling. Staff were generally supportive of the initiatives offered by hospital and health services, with certain interventions being more appreciated (e.g., staff respite areas). Rapid, locally, and culturally appropriate workplace-based responses may counter the negative mental health impact on staff; but a stepped response is required for a smaller number of staff at risk of mental illness, or those with pre-existing mental illness. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> Unique Identifier: CRD42020222761.","Branjerdporn, Bowman, Kenworthy, Stapelberg","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.812365","20220311","COVID-19; health service; healthcare workers; mental health interventions; pandemic; psychiatric services; staff wellbeing; system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28404,""
"Affective touch perception and longing for touch during the COVID-19 pandemic","Interpersonal touch and affective touch play a crucial role in social interactions and have a positive influence on mental health. The social distancing regulations implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the ability to engage in interpersonal touch. This could cause longing for touch, and it might subsequentlyÃ‚Â alter the way in which affective touch is perceived. To investigate this, we conducted an online survey and included 1982 participants, which contained questions regarding the COVID-19 regulations, longing for touch, and the perceived pleasantness of affective and non-affective touch. Results showed that participants reported feelings of longing for touch. This significantly increased with the duration and severity of the COVID-19 regulations. In addition,Ã‚Â participants who experienced more longing for touch rated videos of affective and non-affective touch as more pleasant. Current results provide insight in the impact of sudden and prolonged COVID-19 regulations and show that increasing the duration and severity of these regulations is associated with a higher desire for touch, which is associated with increased perceived pleasantness of observing touch.","Meijer, Hasenack, Kamps, Mahon, Titone, Dijkerman, Keizer","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07213-4","20220311","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28405,""
"Network analysis of depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents during the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic","Network analysis is an effective approach for examining complex relationships between psychiatric symptoms. This study was designed to examine item-level relationships between depressive and anxiety symptoms using network analysis in an adolescent sample and identified the most central symptoms within the depressive-anxiety symptoms network model. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), respectively. The structure of depressive and anxiety symptoms was characterized using ""Strength"" and ""Bridge Strength"" as centrality indices in the symptom network. Network stability was tested using a case-dropping bootstrap procedure. Finally, a Network Comparison Test (NCT) was conducted to examine whether network characteristics differed on the basis of gender, school grade and residence. Network analysis revealed that nodes PHQ2 (""Sad mood""), GAD6 (""Irritability""), GAD3 (""Worry too much""), and PHQ6 (""Guilty"") were central symptoms in the network model of adolescents. Additionally, bridge symptoms linking anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample were nodes PHQ6 (""Guilty""), PHQ2 (""Sad mood""), and PHQ9 (""Suicide ideation""). Gender, school grade and residence did not significantly affect the network structure. Central symptoms (e.g., Sad mood, Irritability, Worry too much, and Guilty) and key bridge symptoms (e.g., Guilty, Sad mood, and Suicide ideation) in the depressive and anxiety symptoms network may be useful as potential targets for intervention among adolescents who are at risk for or suffer from depressive and anxiety symptoms.","Cai, Bai, Liu, Chen, Qi, Liu, Cheung, Su, Lin, Tang, Jackson, Zhang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-01838-9","20220311","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28406,""
"Depressive symptomsÃ‚Â among Olympic athletes during the Covid-19 pandemic","The aim of this study was to analyze athlete-specific psychological strain among Olympic athletes following the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey that comprised three sub-sections (Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-Depression Module (PHQ-8) and Participant characteristic) concerning mental health, performance issues and concerns about the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, was distributed online and sent to 102 Olympic athletes. A total of 85 participants from 11 Olympic sportsÃ‚Â were enrolled. Results indicated that most athletes showed psychological strain related to concerns regarding the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics. Depression severity was positively associated with maladaptive avoidance coping patterns, negative effects in training, worries and fear. Depression severity was also negatively associated with motivation and adaptive factors such as chances and opportunities that can be drawn from the pandemic. The present sample of Olympic athletes reported suffering from psychological uncertainty associated with the postponement of the Olympic games. Sports federations should therefore, provide ongoing wellbeing support to athletes and offer them, for example, sports psychological support in order to be able to better deal with pandemic-related uncertainties and changes.","Lambert, Schuetz, Rice, Purcell, Stoll, Trajdos, Ritzmann, BÃƒÂ¶hm, Walz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13102-022-00427-z","20220311","Athletes; COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health; Olympic Games Tokyo","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28407,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on management of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had widespread impacts on the lives of parents and children. We determined how the pandemic affected Type 1 diabetes patients at a large urban pediatric teaching hospital. We compared patient characteristics, glycemic control, PHQ-9 depression screen, in person and virtual outpatient encounters, hospitalizations and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) utilization in approximately 1600 patients in 1 year periods preceding and following the local imposition of COVID-related restrictions on 3/15/2020 (""2019"" and ""2020"" groups, respectively). In a generalized linear model, increasing age, non-commercial insurance, Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, and non-utilization of CGMs were all associated with higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), but there was no difference between the 2019 and 2020 groups. The time in range in CGM users was lower with non-commercial insurance and in Black and Hispanic patients; it improved slightly from 2019 to 2020. CGM utilization by patients with non-commercial insurance (93% of such patients were in government programs, 7% uninsured or ""other"") increased markedly. In 2020, patients with commercial insurance (i.e., private-pay or provided by an employer) had fewer office visits, but insurance status did not influence utilization of the virtual visit platform. There was no change in hospitalization frequency from 2019 to 2020 in either commercially or non-commercially insured patients, but patients with non-commercial insurance were hospitalized at markedly higher frequencies in both years. PHQ-9 scores were unchanged. Hospitalization frequency, glycemic control and depression screening were unchanged in our large urban pediatric teaching hospital during the COVID pandemic. Increased utilization of CGM and rapid adoption of telemedicine may have ameliorated the impact of the pandemic on disease management.","Choudhary, Adhikari, White","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-022-03189-2","20220311","Continuous glucose monitor; Generalized linear model; Hemoglobin A1c; Patient health questionnaire -9; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28408,""
"Differential response to three antidepressants in patients with major depressive episode who suffered Covid-19-related trauma","The Covid 19 pandemic might have impacted response to drug treatment in major depressive episode (MDE). We compared responses to three different antidepressant drugs, i.e., vortioxetine, sertraline, and trazodone, in outpatients with MDE during Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), or schizophrenia and related psychoses (SSOPDs) during two time periods, i.e., prior to suffering Covid-19-related trauma and after suffering such trauma. We conducted an observational study on clinically stabilised for at least 6 months outpatients with MDE during the course of MDD (N=58), BD (N=33), or SSOPDs (N=51). Patients, whose baseline assessments of Montgomery-Ãƒâ€¦sberg Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (Ham-A), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Visual Analogue Scale for Craving (VAS-crav) and World Health Organization Quality of Life, Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF) were available, were recruited at the time they suffered Covid-19-related traumas. Fifty patients, prior to the pandemic, when they were clinically stable, were treated with 15 mg/die vortioxetine, 44 with 450 mg/die trazodone, and 48 with 150 mg/die sertraline. After experiencing a major Covid-19-related personal trauma, patients showed clinical worsening which required dosage adjustment (20 mg/day vortioxetine; 600 mg/day trazodone, and 200 mg/day sertraline) and, for a part of them, a month of hospitalisation. Scores on the MADRS, Ham-A, BPRS, VAS-crav and WHOQOL-BREF were compared drug-wise and gender-wise with Student's t test for continuous variables and Ãâ€¡2 for categorical variables. The sample consisted of 142 outpatients (age, mean 39.63 Ã‚Â± 16.84; 70 men and 72 women); women were older than men (mean age 43.18 Ã‚Â± 17.61 vs. 35.98 Ã‚Â± 15.30; p=0.01). The two genders did not differ on other variables). For all treatments, symptoms worsening was observed at the time of trauma, followed by slow recovery with treatment readjustment. Trauma-related worsening in patients on vortioxetine was less intense than patients on the other two antidepressants and recovery was faster. All drugs were associated with an improvement in QoL. The vortioxetine group showed a lower hospitalisation rate (24%) than sertraline (35.4%) and trazodone (38.6%), but this was not significant (p=0.27). All drugs improved symptoms after Covid-19 trauma in patients with MDE, with vortioxetine showing a small advantage. No differences between vortioxetine, sertraline and trazodone were found as concerns the need for hospitalisation.","De Filippis, Lombardozzi, Matrone, Amici, Trovini, Perrini, Di Giovanni, Giovanetti, Kotzalidis","https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159X20666220310122849","20220311","Anxiety; Covid-19; Craving; Hospitalization; Major Depressive Episode; Pandemic-related trauma; Quality of Life; Sertraline; Substance Use Disorders; Trazodone; Vortioxetine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28409,""
"The indirect health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents: A review","It is pertinent to examine potentially detrimental impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on young people. We conducted a review to assess the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents. Databases of MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched in June 2020, using keywords for 'children', 'adolescents' and 'COVID-19'. English papers discussing young people in context to the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Quality of selected studies was evaluated and scored. Of the 2013 identified articles, 22 met the inclusion criteria, including 11 cohort studies, ten cross-sectional studies and one report. Five main issues emerged: Increased mental health conditions, declines in presentations to paediatric emergency departments, declines in vaccination rates, changes in lifestyle behaviour (mainly decreased physical activity for specific groups of children), and changes in paediatric domestic violence and online child sexual abuse. There are early indications that the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the health of young people, and this is amplified for those with existing health conditions and vulnerabilities. Despite this, there is limited insight into the protective factors for young people's health and wellbeing, as well as how the impacts of the pandemic can be mitigated in both the short and long term.","Oostrom, Cullen, Peters","https://doi.org/10.1177/13674935211059980","20220311","ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights; epidemiology; psychology; vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28410,""
"Association among sleep, depression, and health-related quality of life in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","Sleep disturbance is well documented as a crucial element that impairs health. Depression and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which on behalf of a patient's overall perception of emotional, physical and social well-being, are increasingly emphasized self-reported health outcomes especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Among dialysis patients, sleep disturbance is associated with depression and poorer HRQOL. The study was designed to depict the prevalence of sleep disturbance, and to explore the association among sleep, depression, and HRQOL in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 172 non-dialysis CKD patients enrolled in this cross-sectional study, with sociodemographic and clinical data recorded. Sleep, HRQOL, and depression were evaluated via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Kidney Disease Quality of Life 36-Item Short-Form Survey (KDQOL-36), and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. A total of 100 (58%) met the criteria for poor sleep. Good sleepers had strikingly disparate HRQOL and depression scores compared to poor sleepers. Sleep disorders were significantly associated with decreased HRQOL and increased depression in regression models adjusted or unadjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation analysis indicated depression was a significant mediator explaining 51% of the relationship between sleep status with physical component summary (PCS) and played a fully mediating role in the association between sleep and mental component summary (MCS). Our study suggested the high incidence of sleep disorders in patients with non-dialysis CKD during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the tight associations among sleep, depression, and HRQOL. Considering the negative influences of sleep and depression on HRQOL, appropriate screening and treatment for these treatable health-related domains are necessary for patients with non-dialysis CKD.","Chen, Li, Zhou, Chen, Li, Meng, Wei, Zhang, Feng, Li, Sun, Liu","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-3416","20220311","Chronic kidney disease (CKD); depression; health-related quality of life (HRQOL); sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28411,""
"Dual guidance structure for evaluation of patients with unclear diagnosis in centers for rare diseases (ZSE-DUO): study protocol for a controlled multi-center cohort study","In individuals suffering from a rare disease the diagnostic process and the confirmation of a final diagnosis often extends over many years. Factors contributing to delayed diagnosis include health care professionals' limited knowledge of rare diseases and frequent (co-)occurrence of mental disorders that may complicate and delay the diagnostic process. The ZSE-DUO study aims to assess the benefits of a combination of a physician focusing on somatic aspects with a mental health expert working side by side as a tandem in the diagnostic process. This multi-center, prospective controlled study has a two-phase cohort design. Two cohorts of 682 patients each are sequentially recruited from 11 university-based German Centers for Rare Diseases (CRD): the standard care cohort (control, somatic expertise only) and the innovative care cohort (experimental, combined somatic and mental health expertise). Individuals aged 12Ã‚Â years and older presenting with symptoms and signs which are not explained by current diagnoses will be included. Data will be collected prior to the first visit to the CRD's outpatient clinic (T0), at the first visit (T1) and 12Ã‚Â months thereafter (T2). Primary outcome is the percentage of patients with one or more confirmed diagnoses covering the symptomatic spectrum presented. Sample size is calculated to detect a 10 percent increase from 30% in standard care to 40% in the innovative dual expert cohort. Secondary outcomes are (a) time to diagnosis/diagnoses explaining the symptomatology; (b) proportion of patients successfully referred from CRD to standard care; (c) costs of diagnosis including incremental cost effectiveness ratios; (d) predictive value of screening instruments administered at T0 to identify patients with mental disorders; (e) patients' quality of life and evaluation of care; and f) physicians' satisfaction with the innovative care approach. This is the first multi-center study to investigate the effects of a mental health specialist working in tandem with a somatic expert physician in CRDs. If this innovative approach proves successful, it will be made available on a larger scale nationally and promoted internationally. In the best case, ZSE-DUO can significantly shorten the time to diagnosis for a suspected rare disease.

"Clinical effectiveness of music interventions for dementia and depression in elderly care (MIDDEL): Australian cohort of an international pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial","Background Dementia and depression are highly prevalent and comorbid conditions among older adults living in care homes and are associated with individual distress and rising societal costs. Effective, scalable, and feasible interventions are needed. Music interventions have shown promising effects, but the current evidence base is inconclusive. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of two different music interventions on the depressive symptoms of people with dementia living in residential aged care. Methods We implemented a 2 Ã— 2 factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial to determine whether group music therapy (GMT) is more effective than no GMT with standard care, or recreational choir singing (RCS) is more effective than no RCS with standard care, for reducing depressive symptoms and other secondary outcomes in people with dementia with mild to severe depressive symptoms living in residential aged care. Care home units with at least ten residents were allocated to GMT, RCS, GMT plus RCS, or standard care, using a computer-generated list with block randomisation (block size four). The protocolised interventions were delivered by music therapists (GMT) and community musicians (RCS). The primary outcome was Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 months, assessed by a masked assessor and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed-effects models, which examined the effects of GMT versus no-GMT and RCS versus no-RCS, as well as interaction effects of GMT and RCS. We report on the Australian cohort of an international trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03496675, and anzctr.org.au, ACTRN12618000156280. Findings Between June 15, 2018, and Feb 18, 2020, we approached 12 RAC facilities with 26 eligible care home units and, excluding six units who could not be enrolled due to COVID-19 lockdowns, we screened 818 residents. Between July 18, 2018, and Nov 26, 2019, 20 care home units were randomised (318 residents). Recruitment ceased on March 17, 2020, due to COVID-19. The primary endpoint, available from 20 care home units (214 residents), suggested beneficial effects of RCS (mean difference â€“4Â·25, 95% CI â€“7Â·89 to â€“0Â·62; p=0Â·0221) but not GMT (mean difference â€“0Â·44, â€“4Â·32 to 3Â·43; p=0Â·8224). No related serious adverse events occurred. Interpretation Our study supports implementing recreational choir singing as a clinically relevant therapeutic intervention in reducing depressive symptoms for people with dementia in the Australian care home context.

"Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of the BEAM App-based program for mothers of children 18-36 months","Background: The prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and pregnant individuals are experiencing concerningly elevated levels of mental health symptoms worldwide. Many individuals may now be at heightened risk of postpartum mental health disorders. Recent evidence suggests that the cognitive development of children born during the pandemic has been impacted. There are significant concerns that a cohort of children may be at-risk for impaired self-regulation and mental illness due to elevated exposure to perinatal maternal mental illness. The intergenerational effects of maternal mental illness are most pronounced when depression persists. With both an increased prevalence of depression and limited availability of services due to the pandemic, there is an urgent need for accessible eHealth interventions for mothers of young children. The aims of this trial are to evaluate the efficacy of the Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) app-based program for reducing maternal depression symptoms (primary outcome) as well as for improving anxiety symptoms, family relationships, parenting, mother and child functioning (secondary outcomes) compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with repeated measures will be used to evalute the efficacy of the BEAM intervention compared to TAU among a sample of 140 mothers with children aged 18 to 36 months, who self-report moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Individuals will be recruited online and those randomized to the treatment group will participate in 10 weeks of modules on mental health and parenting, an online social support forum, and weekly group teletherapy sessions. Assessment of depression (primary outcome), family relationship quality, anxiety, parenting, and mother and child functioning will occur at 18-36 months postpartum (pre-test, T1), immediately after the last week of the BEAM intervention (post-test, T2), and at 3 months after the intervention (follow-up, T3). Primary outcomes will also be assessed weekly throughout the 10 week intervention. Discussion: eHealth interventions have the potential to address elevated maternal mental health symptoms, parenting stress, and child funtioning concerns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and provide accessible programming to mothers who are in need of support. This RCT will build on an open pilot trial of the BEAM program and provide further evaluation of this evidence-based intervention for mothers experiencing depression. Findings will increase understanding of depression and parenting stress in mothers with young children and reveal the potential for long-term improvements in maternal and child health and family well-being.","Elisabeth Bailin Xie et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01BE-950-329","20220310","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; maternal; mental health; parenting; psychoeducation; depression; rct","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-12","",28415,""
