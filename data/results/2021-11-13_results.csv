"Healthcare worker resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study of primary care providers in India","Since 2020, the world saw a myriad of creative health-care policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article studied the experience of rural primary care providers (PCPs) in India deputized for COVID-19 care in urban areas. In-depth interviews were conducted with PCPs (n = 19), who served at COVID-19 facilities. Lack of epidemic management and intensive tertiary care experience, limited and inadequate training, and fear of infection emerged as the primary sources of distress, in addition to absent systemic mental health support and formalized recognition. Even so, resilience among the respondents emerged as a result of encouragement from their families, peers, and mentors through various means including social media, and from individual recognition from communities and local governments. Rural PCPs expressed an eagerness to serve at the frontlines of COVID-19 and demonstrated indomitable spirit in the face of an acutely understaffed health system, growing uncertainty, and concerns about personal and family health. It is imperative to reconfigure health-care education and continuing professional development, and equip all health-care professionals with mental health support and the ability to deal with public health emergencies and build a more resilient health workforce.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the health-related anxiety and behavioral changes among pregnant women - A cross-sectional study","Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has been the cause of agony for millions of people worldwide. Anxiety of losing near ones and stress of rearing children besides bearing the bulk of domestic tasks have led to certain behavioral changes in the pregnant women. Aims and Objectives: This study aims to assess anxiety, awareness, and behavioral changes among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, College of Medicine and J.N.M. Hospital, Kalyani, West Bengal, India, from May 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. All antenatal patients after the second trimester visiting the OPD or maternity ward, satisfying inclusion criteria after formal consent, were considered for the study. Results: Out of a total of 139 patients, mostly primigravida, 122 (87.7%) participants were of 18-33 years age. Observations revealed that 24% more women were worried about their own health after the arrival of pandemic. The overall worry percentage for unborn baby (88%), existing children (76%), and older relatives (38%) remained uniform throughout the study period. Staying at home, stocking of food, and medical equipment showed a downward trend toward the end of the study. Conclusion: The impact of the pandemic has been mammoth, taking a toll on the behavior and anxiety of the pregnant women, which when unnoticed may have a long-term effect on their mental health as well as family life. Physical and mental support from external and internal sources will pave the way to a healthier mental well-being of these antenatal mothers.

"Routledge Handbook of Health Geography Edited by Valorie A Crooks, Gavin J Andrews and Jamie Pearce (2018)","In this section, three cross-cutting themes are examined: inequalities and inequities;structural drivers of global and local differences in health;and global processes affecting health and inequalities. Some ideas for the future of this discipline are also presented in this last section: among them, the notion that health geographers must develop practices that recognise and help tackle pressing health issues head-on and must consider the health consequences of ageing populations and widening health inequalities as well as the health impacts of climate change and other global health phenomena. Other interesting concepts examined in the chapters include therapeutic landscapes, poststructuralist geographies of health, and the influence of the nonrepresentational theory in health geography.

"Impact of COVID-19 Public Health Safety Measures on Births in Scotland between March and May 2020","Objective To combat the wide-spread transmission of COVID-19, many countries, including the United Kingdom, have imposed nationwide lockdowns. Little is known about how these public health safety measures affect pregnant mothers and their offspring. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 public health safety measures on births in Scotland. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Using routinely collected health data on pregnancy and birth in Scotland, this study compares all births (N = 7342) between 24th of March and May 2020 to births in the same period in 2018 (N = 8323) to investigate the potential negative impact of public health safety measures introduced in Scotland in spring 2020. Birth outcomes were compared using Mann-Whitney-U tests and chi-square tests. Results Mothers giving birth during the pandemic tended to combine breastfeeding and formula-feeding rather than exclusively breastfeed or exclusively formula-feed, stayed in hospital for fewer days and more often had an epidural or a spinal anaesthetic compared to women giving birth in 2018. Conclusion Overall, results suggest little impact of public health safety measures on birth outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the longer-term impacts of being born in the pandemic on both maternal mental health and child development.","Speyer, Lydia Gabriela, Marryat, Louise, Auyeung, Bonnie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+Public+Health+Safety+Measures+on+Births+in+Scotland+between+March+and+May+2020","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Public health;2021.; Publication details: Public health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-13","",21829,""
"Caring Science to Mitigate Nurses' Moral Distress in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Frontline nurses have cared for seriously ill patients during the COVID 19 pandemic since March 2020. Although an occupational hazard, the repetitive nature of the stress during the pandemic predisposes nurses to emotional harms of anxiety, grief, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicide. Struggling to care for waves of critically ill patients, despite workplace obstacles and personal challenges, has rendered nurses vulnerable. Nurses deserve assistance to navigate hazards to their well-being and are an essential and irreplaceable human resource.

"Determinants of Psychological Distress during the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Lockdown Measures in Greece and Cyprus","Background: Psychological distress in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures represents an important public health issue. Aim: We studied psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population in Greece and Cyprus. Also, we investigated several demographic, clinical and job characteristics of the participants as possible determinants of distress. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Greece and Cyprus. Data collection was performed during lockdown measures and in particular during April 21st to May 4th 2020. We used the Greek version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R-Gr) to measure the distress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. Also, we collected data regarding the demographic, clinical and job characteristics of the participants. All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study. Results: Seventeen point four percent of the participants had overall IES-R score from 24 to 32 indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical concern, while 33.5% had overall IES-R score &gt;32 indicating that PTSD is a probable diagnosis. Females, Cyprus residents, participants that live with elderly people or patients with a chronic disease in home, participants with a mental health disease or/and chronic disease, participants under pharmaceutical treatment, participants that lost their work due to the pandemic and participants that work in hospital experienced greater distress. Also, increased age and decreased educational level was associated with increased distress. Conclusions: Findings suggest that our sample experienced great distress and this distress was affected by several demographic, clinical and job characteristics. Appropriate interventions should be established in order to support psychologically high risk groups and decrease their distress.","Galanis, Petros R. N.

"Burnout, Discrimination, Abuse and Mistreatment in Latin America Neurosurgical Training During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background Discrimination, abuse and mistreatment are prevailing problems reported in neurosurgical-training programs globally. Moreover, the current COVID-19-pandemic may also display a negative impact on burnout levels in neurosurgery-residents. This study aims to evaluate burnout, discrimination and mistreatment in neurosurgical-residents training in Latin-America during the SARS-CoV-2 era. Methods A 33-item electronic survey was sent to neurosurgery-residents from Latin-America from May-10 to May-25, 2021. Statistical analysis was made using IBM-SPSS-25. Results 111 neurosurgery residents responded the survey. Mean age was 29.39Â±2.37 years;22.5% were female and 36% were training in Mexico. Residents who reported suffering from discrimination for testing positive to COVID-19 had the highest levels of depersonalization (66.7%, p=0.043) and emotional-exhaustion (75%, p= 0.023). Female respondents presented higher rates of gender discrimination (80%vs.1.2%, p=0.001), abuse (84%vs.58.1%, p&lt;0.005) and sexual-harassment (24%vs.0%, p&lt;0.001) than male respondents. Residents training in Mexico presented lower rates of emotional or verbal abuse (59.2%vs.32.5%, p=0.007) and bullying (p&lt;0.005) than other countries in Latin-America. Older-age was a protective factor for high depersonalization scores (OR 0.133, 95%CI 0.035-0.500). Suffering from discrimination represented a risk factor for presenting high emotional-exhaustion scores (OR 3.019, 95%CI 1.057-8.629). High levels of depersonalization were associated with a 7-fold increased risk of presenting suicidal ideation (OR 7.869, 95%CI 1.266-48.88). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant burden on several aspects of healthcare workersâ€™ lives. Our results provide a broad overview of its impact on burnout, discrimination and mistreatment as experienced by neurosurgery residents training in Latin-America, laying the groundwork for future studies and potential interventions.","De la Cerda-Vargas, MarÃ­a F.; Stienen, Martin N.; Campero, Ãlvaro, PÃ©rez-Castell, Armando F.; Soriano-SÃ¡nchez, JosÃ© A.; Nettel-Rueda, Barbara, Borba, Luis A.

"Gender Variation and Late-life Depression: Findings from a National Survey in the USA","Based on the Wave 3 National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (2015â€“2016), this study has extensive breadth in examining the roles of multiple stressors (i.e., health-related, social relationship, community) and coping resources (i.e., social participation and social support from family and friends) in explaining depressive symptomatology among a recent cohort of the U.S. national sample of community-dwelling older men (n = 1,431) and women (n = 1,673). Statistical additive and interactive models were tested. Results from this pre-COVID study serve as a baseline, and show that gender had significant independent and joint effects on stress and coping factors in explaining depressive symptoms. Parallel regression analyses were conducted for each group. Findings suggest that significantly more women (26.9%) reported depressive symptoms than men (19.9%) (CESD-11 score = 9). Multivariate analyses show that unique predictors for older menâ€™s depression include less support from friends, more cognitive challenges, and feeling less control in life. For women, less social participation, less emotional support from spouse, greater IADL impairment, and family disharmony were more significantly associated with their depressive symptoms than menâ€™s. Contrary to the literature, community factors were not statistically significant in predicting depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that correlates of depressive symptoms impact older women and men differently. Results point to the need for gender-sensitive mental health services and programs to protect community-dwelling older adults in USA against depression, especially in light of the recent COVID era social proximity restrictions.","Cheung, Ethan Siu Leung, Mui, Ada C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Gender+Variation+and+Late-life+Depression:+Findings+from+a+National+Survey+in+the+USA","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Ageing international;: 1-18, 2021.; Publication details: Ageing international;: 1-18, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-13","",21833,""

Exposure The COVID-19 lockdown period. Main outcome (s) and measure (s) The hypothesis being tested was formulated before the study. The null hypothesis tested was a decline in number of self-harm and violence cases during the lockdown. Results A total of 828 patients were analysed over both the time periods, out of which 30% (248) were females while 70% (580) were males. Increases in self-harm and violence were 12.71% and 95.32% respectively per 1000 ED admissions. A significant correlation was found between the COVID-19 lockdown and the increased incidence (X2 (1, NÂ =Â 828)Â =Â 9.2, pÂ &lt;Â .05). An increase of violence by known individuals and between partners was seen. Intimate partner violence also increased to 7%. X2 (3, NÂ =Â 662)Â =Â 21.03, pÂ &lt;Â .05. In the self harm dataset an increase in mortality, ICU admissions and decision to leave against medical advice was noted (X2 (4, NÂ =Â 166)Â =Â 24.49, pÂ &lt;Â .05). Increase in the use of alcohol prior to acts of self harm and violence was noted. Conclusions Increase in the incidence of cases of self-harm and violence reported to the ED was noted during the lockdown period. Upgradation of health-care and law enforcement infrastructure maybe needed to deal with similar circumstances in a more efficient manner.

"Health anxiety is associated with fearful imagery of contracting COVID-19: An experimental study","Background : Aversive mental images of contracting or having a severe disease are assumed to contribute to the development and maintenance of health anxiety (HA) via the elicitation of fear, arousal and defensive mobilization. The current COVID-19 pandemic is known to trigger fears of contracting COVID-19. Methods : In this study, we used an experimental approach to investigate whether COVID-19-related mental images lead to a fearful response and whether this is associated with levels of HA. 139 participants vividly imagined neutral, standard fear and COVID-19 related narrative scenes. Results : Standard fear and COVID-19 scripts prompted higher anxiety, arousal, displeasure and avoidance tendencies as compared to neutral scripts. HA was associated with higher anxiety, arousal, displeasure, imagery vividness and stronger avoidance tendencies during imagery of COVID-19 scenes. No associations were found for anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, there was no association of HA with emotional responses during imagery of standard fear scenes. Limitations : Fear responses were assessed via verbal reports. Future studies should also assess behavioral and physiological correlates of fear. Conclusions : The present results indicate that individuals with high levels of HA are prone to fearful mental imagery of contracting COVID-19 which might be crucial factor contributing to the exacerbation and chronicity of excessive HA in times of a pandemic.","Benke, Christoph, SchÃ¶nborn, Tabea, Habermann, Nina, PanÃ©-FarrÃ©, Christiane A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+anxiety+is+associated+with+fearful+imagery+of+contracting+COVID-19:+An+experimental+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Journal of affective disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of affective disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-13","",21836,""

Objetivo. Describir y correlacionar el nivel de temor, estrÃ©s, conocimientos, actitudes y prÃ¡cticas frente al Covid-19 en estudiantes y reciÃ©n egresados de EnfermerÃ­a en Colombia. MÃ©todo. Se realizÃ³ un estudio observacional de carÃ¡cter transversal y analÃ­tico en Colombia entre octubre y noviembre de 2020. Los instrumentos de temor, estrÃ©s y conocimientos, actitudes y prÃ¡cticas ante el Covid-19 fueron respondidos en lÃ­nea por 1621 estudiantes y reciÃ©n egresados de EnfermerÃ­a. Resultados. Se observÃ³ una media de temor de 20.69 Â± 6.1 puntos, una media de estrÃ©s de 89.15 Â± 29.5 puntos y frecuencias relativas superiores al 80% para los conocimientos actitudes y prÃ¡cticas ante el Covid-19. Correlaciones directas fueron observadas entre los conocimientos y actitudes y a su vez, las actitudes con las prÃ¡cticas. El temor se correlacionÃ³ de forma inversa con los conocimientos y de forma directa con el estrÃ©s ante el Covid-19. ConclusiÃ³n. Se observa un adecuado nivel cognitivo en los estudiantes y reciÃ©n egresados de enfermerÃ­a, pero una deficiencia emocional frente al Covid-19, en tÃ©rminos de estrÃ©s y temor. Es necesario establecer estrategias de soporte en salud mental para esta poblaciÃ³n clave en el control actual y futuro de situaciones de crisis en salud.; Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the emotional health of human resources in health care, despite having knowledge about the virus and its management, health care personnel, including nurses, have shown stress and fear of Covid-19.  Objective. To describe and correlate the level of fear, stress, knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding Covid-19 in nursing students and recent graduates in Colombia. Method. A cross-sectional and analytical observational study was conducted in Colombia between October and November 2020. The instruments of fear, stress and knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding Covid-19 were answered online by 1621 nursing students and recent graduates. Results. A mean fear score of 20.69 Â± 6.1 points, a mean stress score of 89.15 Â± 29.5 points and relative frequencies above 80% for knowledge, attitudes and practices to Covid-19 were observed. Direct correlations were observed between knowledge and attitudes and, in turn, attitudes with the practice. Fear was inversely correlated with knowledge and directly correlated with Covid-19 stress. Conclusion. An adequate cognitive level is observed in nursing students and recent graduates, but an emotional deficiency in the Covid-19, in terms of stress and fear. It is necessary to establish mental health support strategies for this key population in the current and future control of health crisis situations.; IntroduÃ§Ã£o: A pandemia de Covid-19 teve um impacto sobre a saÃºde emocional dos trabalhadores da saÃºde, apesar de terem conhecimento do vÃ­rus e seu manejo, os trabalhadores da saÃºde, incluindo os da Enfermagem, estÃ£o estressados e com medo da Covid-19.
