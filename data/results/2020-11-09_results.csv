"Risk mitigating behaviours in people with inflammatory joint and skin disease during the COVID-19 pandemic differ by treatment type: a cross-sectional patient survey","Objectives Registry data suggest that people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) receiving targeted systemic therapies have fewer adverse COVID-19 outcomes compared to patients receiving no systemic treatments. We used international patient survey data to explore the hypothesis that greater risk-mitigating behaviour in those receiving targeted therapies may account, at least in part, for this observation. Methods Online surveys were completed by individuals with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMD) (UK only) or psoriasis (globally) between 4th May and 7th September 2020. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between treatment type and risk-mitigating behaviour, adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics. We characterised international variation in a mixed effects model. Results Of 3,720 participants (2,869 psoriasis, 851 RMD) from 74 countries, 2,262 (60.8%) reported the most stringent risk-mitigating behaviour (classified here under the umbrella term shielding). A greater proportion of those receiving targeted therapies (biologics and JAK inhibitors) reported shielding compared to those receiving no systemic therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.35-1.97) and standard systemic agents (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.56). Shielding was associated with established risk factors for severe COVID-19 (male sex [OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24], obesity [OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54], comorbidity burden [OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.78]), a primary indication of RMD (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.27-1.48) and a positive anxiety or depression screen (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36-1.80). Modest differences in the proportion shielding were observed across nations. Conclusions Greater risk-mitigating behaviour among people with IMIDs receiving targeted therapies may contribute to the reported lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The behaviour variation across treatment groups, IMIDs and nations reinforces the need for clear evidence-based patient communication on risk mitigation strategies and may help inform updated public health guidelines as the pandemic continues.","Satveer K Mahil; Mark Yates; Sinead M Langan; Zenas ZN Yiu; Teresa Tsakok; Nick Dand; Kayleigh J Mason; Helen McAteer; Freya Meynall; Bolaji Coker; Alexandra Vincent; Dominic Urmston; Amber Vesty; Jade Kelly; Camille Lancelot; Lucy Moorhead; Herve Bachelez; Ian N Bruce; Francesca Capon; Claudia Romina Contreras; Andrew P Cope; Claudia De La Cruz; Paola Di Meglio; Paolo Gisondi; Kimme Hyrich; Denis Jullien; Jo Lambert; Hoseah Waweru; Helena Marzo-Ortega; Iain McInnes; Luigi Naldi; Sam Norton; Lluis Puig; Phyllis Spuls; Raj Sengupta; Tiago Torres; RIchard B Warren; John Weinman; Christopher EM Griffiths; Jonathan N Barker; Matthew A Brown; James B Galloway; Catherine H Smith","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226662","20201107","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-09","",6925,""

"Jiang_2020_Weakened Resilience During Quarantine","Adolescents facing adversities are susceptible to depression and sleep problems. Resilience is an important protective mechanism for coping with difficulties. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents faced multiple hardships including being pulled from their schools and being unable to socialize with friends. Yet, it is unclear whether adolescentsâ€™ resiliency weakened during the global crisis or if the protective power of resilience is maintained under such circumstances. Here, in a partially longitudinal study, we demonstrate that Chinese adolescentsâ€™ resilience weakened during the pandemic-related quarantine compared to before the pandemic. However, resilience protected against depression and sleep problems for adolescents. A mediation model showed that higher resilience was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, which in turn reduced sleep problems. Moreover, social support moderated this mediation. Our findings suggest that, though the resilience of adolescents weakened during the pandemic-related quarantine, it still serves as a protective process helping adolescents cope with adversities such as depression and sleep problems. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.","Huangqi Jiang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-62D-4FE","20201109","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; quarantine; sleep problems; social support; resilience; adolescents; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-09","",6931,""
"Associations of Household Structure and Presence of Children in the Household with Mental Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Abstract Purpose: The objectives of the current study were to: (1) assess the impact of household structure (i.e. living alone compared to living with children, a partner, or both) and presence of children on mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) determine whether these associations are moderated by income or sex. Results: A total of 2,524 adults aged 25-55 were included in the analytic sample. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between explanatory variables and mental distress, measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4. In adjusted models, each additional child under the age of 12 was associated a decrease in mental distress (ÃŸ=-0.21, p=0.03). This finding was significant when adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age, sex, race, education, household income, living with a partner, and currently having a job) and historical depressive symptoms (CESD-8). Having children between the ages of 13 and 18 and household structure were not significantly associated with mental distress. Conclusion: This study supports prior literature that demonstrates the positive association of childrearing with psychological well-being, and suggests that these benefits may be present even under stay-at-home orders in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Emily Smail et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-133-B20","20201109","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; parenting paradox; mental distress; covid-19; family structure","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-09","",6932,""
"Pandemic-Induced Depression and Anxiety in Healthcare Professionals","Medical staff has been at the centre of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, facing diverse work-related stressors. Studies from various countries have shown that healthcare professionals have an increased risk of burnout and mental disorders during pandemic outbreaks. The present study aimed to investigate what kind of work-related stressors healthcare professionals in Germany have been facing and how they have been affected psychologically by the COVID-19 pandemic. N=300 healthcare professionals completed an online survey including the ISR symptom checklist to measure psychological well-being and questions on help-seeking behaviour. Findings were analyzed using t-tests, regression, and comparisons to large clinical and non-clinical samples assessed before and during the pandemic. Results show that healthcare professionals were most affected by protective measures at their workplace and changes in work procedures. Psychological symptoms, especially of anxiety and depression, were significantly more severe than in a non-clinical pre-pandemic sample and in the general population during the pandemic. At the same time, most professionals indicated that they would not seek help for psychological concerns. These findings indicate that healthcare employers need to pay increasing attention to the mental health of their staff, encourage help-seeking behaviour, as well as provide access to mental health support.","Stephan Weibelzahl et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46180-00F-FC8","20201109","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-09","",6933,""
"Correlates of financial concerns, depression symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic: A face-to-face interview approach","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical, mental and financial health of many individuals. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals are specifically impacted amid this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate correlates of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (â€œslumsâ€) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: A total of 435 individuals (male=54.7%; mean age=45.0Â±12.0 years; age range=18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Associated factors included female gender, primary education, jobless, food scarcity, and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, being jobless, being divorced, living in a joint family, excessive sleep, and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness, and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. Limitations: Potential limitations included cross-sectional study design and limited sample size. Conclusions: Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services, should be introduced to mitigate against psychological and financial effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.","Saiful Islam et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-0D3-AD5","20201108","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-09","",6934,""
