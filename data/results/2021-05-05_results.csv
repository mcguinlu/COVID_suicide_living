"Persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms after COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: The nature and extent of persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 are not established. To help inform mental health service planning in the pandemic recovery phase, we systematically determined the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in survivors of COVID-19. Methods: For this pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID CRD42021239750) we searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO to 20th February 2021, plus our own curated database. We included peer-reviewed studies reporting neuropsychiatric symptoms at post-acute or later time-points after COVID-19 infection, and in control groups where available. For each study a minimum of two authors extracted summary data. For each symptom we calculated a primary pooled prevalence using generalised linear mixed models. Heterogeneity was measured with I2. Subgroup analyses were conducted for COVID-19 hospitalisation, severity, and duration of follow-up. Results: From 2,844 unique titles we included 51 studies (n=18,917 patients). The mean duration of follow-up after COVID-19 was 77 days (range 14-182 days). Study quality was generally moderate. The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptom was sleep disturbance (pooled prevalence=27.4% [95%CI 21.4-34.4%]), followed by fatigue (24.4% [17.5-32.9%]), objective cognitive impairment (20.2% [10.3-35.7%]), anxiety (19.1%[13.3-26.8%]), and post-traumatic stress (15.7% [9.9-24.1%]). Only two studies reported symptoms in control groups, both reporting higher frequencies in Covid-19 survivors versus controls. Between-study heterogeneity was high (I2=79.6%-98.6%). There was little or no evidence of differential symptom prevalence based on hospitalisation status, severity, or follow-up duration. Conclusion: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and persistent after recovery from COVID-19. The literature on longer-term consequences is still maturing, but indicates a particularly high frequency of insomnia, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and anxiety disorders in the first six months after infection.","James B Badenoch; Emma R Rengasamy; Cameron J Watson; Katrin Jansen; Stuti Chakraborty; Ritika D Sundaram; Danish Hafeez; Ella Burchill; Aman Saini; Lucretia Thomas; Benjamin Cross; Camille K Hunt; Isabella Conti; Sylvia Ralovska; Zain Hussain; Matthew Butler; Thomas A Pollak; Ivan Koychev; Benedict D Michael; Heinz Holling; Timothy R Nicholson; Jonathan P Rogers; Alasdair G Rooney; - The SARS-CoV-Neuro Collaboration","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.30.21256413","20210504","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13452,""
"Drilling Under the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Diary Study of Professional Football Players' Mental Health and Workout Performance","There is little research examining how individuals' daily experience during a pandemic affects their daily mental health status and work performance. To address this knowledge gap, we invoke conservation of resources (COR) theory to propose a resource-based framework explaining how individuals' daily COVID-19 intrusive experience affects their daily mental health status (depression and anxiety) and work performance via its effect on daily psychosocial resource loss and gain; We further examine whether their supervisors' daily visionary leadership behavior alleviates the adverse impacts of daily COVID-19 intrusive experience. Results, based on daily diary data from 139 football players (or soccer players) at 15 professional football clubs over 5 days during the COVID-19 pandemic, provided support for our predictions. Our study extends the literature by providing previously undocumented evidence on daily within-person variations in mental health status and work performance during a pandemic and by offering theory-driven insights into the mediating and moderating mechanisms involved in within-person variations.

"Unleashing the potential of cell membrane-based nanoparticles for COVID-19 treatment and vaccination","<b>Introduction</b>: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a particular coronavirus strain responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), accounting for more than 2.8 million deaths worldwide. Several health-related strategies have been successfully developed to contain the rapidly-spreading virus across the globe, towards reduction of both disease burden and infection rates. Particularly, attention has been focused on either the development of novel drugs and vaccines, or by adapting already-existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment, which mobilized huge efforts to block disease progression and overcome the shortage of effective measures available at this point.<b>Areas covered</b>: This perspective covers the breakthrough of multifunctional and biomimetic cell membrane-based nanoparticles as next-generation nanosystems for cutting-edge COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccination, specifically cell membrane-derived nanovesicles and cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, both tailorable cell membrane-based nanosystems enriched with the surface repertoire of native cell membranes, towards maximized biointerfacing, immune evasion, cell targeting and cell-mimicking properties.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Nano-based approaches have received widespread interest regarding enhanced antigen delivery, prolonged blood circulation half-life and controlled release of drugs. Cell membrane-based nanoparticles comprise interesting antiviral multifunctional nanoplatforms for blocking SARS-CoV-2 binding to host cells, reducing inflammation through cytokine neutralization and improving drug delivery toward COVID-19 treatment.","Pereira-Silva, Chauhan, Shin, Hoskins, Madou, Martinez-Chapa, Steinmetz, Veiga, Santos","https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2021.1922387","20210504","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; bacteria; biomimetic; cell membrane-coated; infection; nanoparticles; virus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13454,""
"Violations of Suicide-Prevention Guidelines in US Media Coverage of Physician's Suicide Death During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b/><i>Background:</i> Healthcare workers are at elevated risk for suicide; though it has yet to be studied, this risk may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. News media coverage of high-profile suicide is associated with an increased risk of subsequent suicides. No analysis has yet been published of US media practices for reporting on healthcare worker suicides during the pandemic. <i>Aims:</i> The researchers aimed to evaluate pandemic-era media practices by investigating adherence to best-practice suicide reporting guidelines in coverage of Dr. Lorna Breen's death. <i>Methods:</i> The researchers conducted a content analysis of all unique articles by top outlets reporting Dr. Breen's death between April 26 and 29, 2020, and scored them based on their adherence to the 15 best-practice suicide reporting guidelines. <i>Results:</i> Every media outlet violated an average of at least 5 of 15 suicide guidelines in reporting on Dr. Breen's death; some abided by as few as 2 of 15 recommended guidelines. Seven of 15 guidelines were adhered to by fewer than one third of articles. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, notably easy to include, appeared in only 75% of articles. <i>Limitations:</i> The researchers were limited to reviewing media coverage of one specific instance of COVID-era healthcare worker suicide, making these findings applicable as a prominent case study rather than forming a generalizable claim about suicide reporting during the pandemic or about reporting on healthcare suicides. <i>Conclusion:</i> These violations highlight a range of opportunities to improve suicide prevention in the media, which has a responsibility to ensure reporting does not exacerbate the risk of suicide. Improved adherence to these guidelines could reduce harm for healthcare workers during the pandemic.","Lynn-Green, JaÃ…ÂºwiÃ…â€žska, Beckman, Latham","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000778","20210504","COVID-19; ethics; healthcare professionals; media coverage; suicide contagion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13455,""
"Selecting and imagining rewarding activities during the COVID-19 lockdown: Effects on mood and what moderates them","The COVID-19 outbreak strongly restricted daily activities, creating a risk factor for negative affect and depression. This study assessed the immediate effects of a behavioural activation (BA) intervention on positive (PA) and negative (NA) state affect. We expected depression and anxiety to function as moderators reducing the intervention effects. In a quasi-experimental online study, 3624 German-speaking participants evaluated a list of rewarding activities between 9 April and 26 April 2020. A subsample of 2561 (71%) additionally engaged in an imagination task. Depression, anxiety, socioeconomic variables and COVID-19 related burdens were assessed as moderators. There was an increase in PA (total sample dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .13; subsample: dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .27) and a decrease in NA (total sample dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.68; subsample: dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.71; all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The effects rose with higher levels of depression and anxiety (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Furthermore, living with family enhanced the effects on NA, while additionally having to take care of children reduced them. An easy-to-use intervention prompting BA could improve state mood during lockdown. Participants with higher depression and anxiety benefit more. Implications for the prevention of mental health problems during a pandemic are discussed.","Hoyer, Dechmann, Stender, Ã„Å’oliÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12759","20210504","Behavioural activation; COVID-19; Imagination; Mental health; Negative affect; Prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13456,""
"Creating a Scalable Physical Activity Breaks Resource Through the Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model: HYPE The Breaks!","Physically active children have lower rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and depression than their inactive counterparts, and further evidence suggests that integrating physical activity breaks into the school day improves children's classroom behavior, fitness, and cognitive functions.

"Physical activity and medication in Brazilians suffering with non-communicable diseases in quarantine by COVID-19","This study aimed to compare the practice of physical activity in groups of people with chronic diseases with and without medication, before and during the pandemic. 298 Brazilian individuals with chronic non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular, metabolic / endocrine, respiratory, orthopedic, gastrointestinal diseases, anxiety and depression were separated into two groups: with and without medication. A questionnaire with 14 questions was applied, tracing the behavioral profile in relation to physical exercises before and during isolation, interpreted through descriptive analysis, and the groups were compared through Mann-Whitman's statistics. The drop in the percentage of active individuals with or without medication occurred when comparing the scenarios before and during quarantine. However, the difference in the prevalence of active individuals between the groups was significant, showing that the group with medication remained more active. The fear of contamination, the measures of distance and the lack of adherence of the population to classes by videoconference reduced the frequency of physical activities in the general sample population. However, people who used medication showed greater concern about the practice of physical activity to optimize treatment. The isolation period had a negative impact on the practice of physical activity, regardless of the presence of some chronic disease or the use of medication.","Doro, Ferreira Marques, Cantarinho de Lima, De Oliveira Caccalano, De Oliveira Nessi, Chagas Caperuto, De Oliveira Alonso, Leite Portella","https://doi.org/10.4081/ejtm.2021.9772","20210504","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13458,""

"Evolution of psychosocial burden and psychiatric symptoms in patients with psychiatric disorders during the Covid-19 pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic highly impacts mental health worldwide. Patients with psychiatric disorders are a vulnerable risk population for worsening of their condition and relapse of symptoms. This study investigates the pandemic-related course of psychosocial burden in patients with pre-existing mental disorders. With the newly developed Goettingen psychosocial Burden and Symptom Inventory (Goe-BSI) psychosocial burden has been traced retrospectively (1) before the pandemic (beginning of 2020), (2) at its beginning under maximum lockdown conditions (March 2020), and (3) for the current state after maximum lockdown conditions (April/May 2020). The Goe-BSI also integrates the Adjustment Disorder New Module (ADNM-20), assesses general psychiatric symptoms, and resilience. A total of 213 patients covering all major psychiatric disorders (ICD-10 F0-F9) were interviewed once in the time range from April, 24th until May 11th, 2020. Across all diagnoses patients exhibited a distinct pattern with an initial rise followed by a decline of psychosocial burden (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, partial ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09; Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons between all three time-points: pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 to 0.001). Female gender and high ADNM-20 scores were identified as risk factors for higher levels and an unfavorable course of psychosocial burden over time. Most psychiatric symptoms remained unchanged. Trajectories of psychosocial burden vary in parallel to local lockdown restrictions and seem to reflect an adaptive stress response. For female patients with pre-existing mental disorders and patients with high-stress responses, timely and specific treatment should be scheduled. With the continuation of the pandemic, monitoring of long-term effects is of major importance, especially when long incubation times for the development of mental health issues are considered.","Belz, Hessmann, Vogelgsang, Schmidt, Ruhleder, Signerski-Krieger, Radenbach, Trost, Schott, Wiltfang, Wolff-Menzler, Bartels","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-021-01268-6","20210504","Adjustment disorder; Coronavirus; Mental health; Psychosocial stress; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13462,""
"Do Psychological Needs Play a Role in Times of Uncertainty? Associations with Well-Being During the COVID-19 Crisis","Across the world, measures were taken to contain the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. Many of these measures caused a sudden rupture in people's daily routines, thereby eliciting considerable uncertainty and potentially also hampering the satisfaction of individuals' psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Drawing upon Maslow's Hierarchical Need Theory and Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the unique role of felt insecurity and the psychological needs, as well as their dynamic interplay, in the prediction of mental health. A large and heterogeneous sample of adults (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5118; <i>M</i>ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43.45Ã‚Â years) was collected during the first ten days of the lockdown period in Flanders, Belgium. A subsample (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°835<i>, M</i>ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41.39) participated during a second wave one week later. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that felt insecurity, need satisfaction and need frustration all independently predicted various positive (life satisfaction, sleep quality) and negative indicators depressive symptoms, anxiety) of mental health, with little systematic evidence for interactions between the predictors. The pattern of findings obtained concurrently largely held in the longitudinal analyses. Finally, results showed that associations between felt insecurity and lower concurrent and prospective mental health were partially mediated by need satisfaction and frustration, with especially psychological need frustration predicting changes in mental health over time. Overall, the findings suggest that satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness is not just a 'luxury good'. Satisfaction of these needs is important also in times of insecurity, while need frustration represents a risk factor for maladjustment during such times.","Vermote, Waterschoot, MorbÃƒÂ©e, Van der Kaap-Deeder, Schrooyen, Soenens, Ryan, Vansteenkiste","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-021-00398-x","20210504","Basic psychological needs; Hierarchical needs theory; Insecurity; Self-determination theory; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13463,""
"The Role of Alcohol Biomarkers in Detecting a Physician's COVID-19-Related Acute Stress Response: A Case Report","Alcohol biomarkers are used to detect alcohol exposure in clinical and forensic settings. This includes professional health program (PHP) monitoring of healthcare workers in recovery from substance use disorders. Here we present the case of a physician whose positive alcohol biomarker test result was complicated by a traumatic stress response to frontline work during COVID-19. An anesthesiologist under PHP monitoring for substance use disorder and depression was interviewed extensively, urine and blood biomarkers were obtained, and longitudinal structured and semi-structured interviews related to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and cravings were used to monitor responses to the unanticipated death of a patient who succumbed to COVID-19. After an initial positive ethylglucuronide (EtG) and ethylsulfate (EtS) toxicology test result, all subsequent testing was negative. Standardized assessments and clinical interviews provided documentation of a post-traumatic stress reaction. The physician described compulsive sanitizing of hands/arms and mask with highly concentrated ethanol-based products. Inhalation of ethanol vapors is a possible explanation for the initial positive EtG/EtS results. To our knowledge, this case represents the highest reported levels of EtG/EtS likely due to workplace exposure. The importance of rapid intervention to thoroughly assess positive toxicology testing and its source(s) cannot be overstated, particularly as it relates to frontline healthcare workers during the pandemic. The PHP monitoring process provides an opportunity to promptly detect healthcare workers in distress, allowing for efficient connection to supportive resources and/or treatment when indicated, and possibly preventing escalation of symptoms or disease recurrence.","Polles, Jacobs, Brazle, Merlo","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000865","20210504","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13464,""

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults and children in the United Arab Emirates: a nationwide cross-sectional study","The psychosocial impact of previous infectious disease outbreaks in adults has been well documented, however, there is limited information on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults and children in the United Arab Emirate (UAE) community. The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children.

"Structural Correlates of Mental Health Support Access Among Sexual Minority Youth of Color During COVID-19","Objective: Many youth with mental health needs cannot access treatment, with multiply-marginalized youth, such as sexual minority youth of Color (SMYoC), experiencing both structural and identity-related barriers to care. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to exacerbate multi-level treatment access barriers facing SMYoC youth nationwide. However, little large-scale research has examined access to mental health care among SMYoC across the United States, either during or prior to the pandemic. Such work is critical to understanding and ameliorating barriers in this domain. Methods: Using data from adolescents who self-identified as SMYoC and who endorsed a desire for mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=470, ages 13-16, from 43 U.S. states), we examined associations between state-level, structural factors (income inequality; mental healthcare provider shortage; anti-Black racism; homophobia; and the interaction between anti-Black racism and homophobia) and SMYoC mental health treatment access. Results: Multinomial logistic regressions revealed state-level mental healthcare provider shortage as the only significant predictor of SMYoC reporting they never (versus always) accessed mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic. SMYoC living in areas with both lower homophobia and lower anti-Black racism were more likely to report always (versus sometimes) accessing mental health treatment. Conclusions: Results highlight the critical importance of considering diverse structural factors and applying an intersectional lens when exploring barriers to mental health treatment among multiply-marginalized youth. In locations where provider shortages are less severe, cultural stigmaâ€”including anti-Black racism and homophobiaâ€”may still pose challenges for SMYoC in need of mental health care.","Chantelle A.

"Snapshot of a social movement: mental health and protest classes in Hong Kong","Background: Popular protests have broken out in worldwide, particularly in the last few years. In 2019, numerous demonstrations against an extradition bill occurred in Hong Kong until pandemic restrictions were imposed. The policing response relied heavily on methods such as batons, tear gas and rubber bullets. Given the relevance for other geographical contexts, the current study investigated the mental health impacts on protest participants and spillover to community members. Methods: Surveys were disseminated on social media in August and October 2019 to collect demographics, political views, protest participation, exposure to (protest-related) potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and mental health symptoms. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted using demographic data and inter-class differences in PTEs and mental health symptoms were examined. Results: There were 37,541 (59.8% female) and 40,703 (50.0% female) responses in August and October. Respondents, even those with low participation, reported significant levels of depression, anxiety, and symptoms of traumatic stress (STS). The LCA suggested a 5-class solution (youth, allies, supporters, sympathizers, and frontliners). Mental health symptoms and PTEs varied with class membership, with 50.8% of frontliners reporting severe STS. Limitations: The non-random sampling and self-reported measures may over-estimate the prevalence of mental distress in the wider population. Conclusions: Large numbers of pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong reported high rates of depression, anxiety and STS during mass protests. Younger and more heavily involved respondents faced the highest mental health risks, however elevated rates were also observed for respondents with low participation.","Adrienne Li et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DC-72A-651","20210416","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; trauma; protests; police brutality; civil conflict; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13470,""
"Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the Context of COVID-19: A Nationwide Randomized-Controlled Trial","The COVID-19 pandemic caused financial hardship, social isolation, and distress, increasing risk for adolescent depression. Even before the pandemic, <50% of youth with depression accessed care, and not all benefited from existing treatments. Accordingly, this randomized-controlled trial tested online single-session interventions (SSIs) during COVID-19 in adolescents with elevated depression (N=2,452, ages 13-16). Adolescents recruited via social media were randomized to 1 of 3 SSIs: a behavioral activation SSI, an SSI teaching that personal traits are malleable, or a supportive control. We tested each SSIâ€™s effects on post-intervention (hopelessness, agency) and 3-month outcomes (depression, hopelessness, agency, generalized anxiety, COVID-related trauma). Compared to the control, both active SSIs reduced 3-month depressive symptoms; decreased post-intervention and 3-month hopelessness; and increased post-intervention agency. Several differences between active SSIs emerged. Results confirm the effectiveness of two free-of-charge, online SSIs for adolescents with elevated depression, even in the high-stress context of COVID-19.","Jessica L.

"Associativity between COVID-19 Pandemic and Serious Mental Illness: Rapid Systematic Review within Salutogenesis Model for Public Health Management","The COVID-19 Pandemic, SARS-COV-2 virus-form transformations, and ensuing psychosocial stress stemming from environmental change and isolation, has led to the conjecture that there would be a surge in psychosis cases. Intuitively, patients with Serious Mental Illness (SMI), like Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Major Depression, would be particularly susceptible. Existing literature illustrates psychological distress as a primary effect of the Pandemic - on people with/without SMI. We initiated a rapid review to determine the impact of the SARS-COV-2 virus - in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases - on people with/without psychosis. We envisioned that this would provide insights on effective clinical-intervention methods for psychotic-patients, during and after the Pandemic. Our review draws from papers, published in 2020, that considered participants - with/without psychiatric illness and exposure to SARS-COV-2 infection. The Salutogenesis Model was used to comprehend observations from the systematic-review, leading to suggestions and recommendations for preventive and promotive public health strategies.","Sweta Kaman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46167-E3D-17D","20210405","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; serious mental illness (smi); covid-19; sense of coherence (soc); salutogenesis model; public health management","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13472,""
"Investigating the feasibility of MePlusMe, an online intervention to support mental health, wellbeing, and study skills in higher education students","Introduction: While there are several web-based interventions to support mental health, few target students in higher education (HE). Importantly, more research is needed to establish their effectiveness. Here, we provide a pragmatic evaluation of an online intervention (MePlusMe) specifically designed to improve the mental health, wellbeing, and study skills of HE students. Methods: In accordance with the published protocol for a feasibility study, we obtained a convenience sample of 137 HE students, with students recruited to participate in an 8-week intervention. To evaluate the feasibility and assess the effects of this online intervention, validated measures of mood (depression and anxiety), wellbeing and self-efficacy were collected at baseline, 2, 4 and 8 weeks, alongside two feedback forms assessing design and functionality (baseline), and engagement (week 4 and 8). Results: We observed statistically significant reductions in levels of anxiety and depression, and increases in wellbeing over the 8-week intervention period. However, there were no significant changes in self-efficacy. Participants rated the system design and functionality positively, and qualitative findings indicated high levels of satisfaction with MePlusMe. Some areas for improvement were also identified. Discussion: Rates of initial consent, subsequent engagement with the programme, and measure completion, together with qualitative feedback, support the acceptability of the intervention. Significant benefits were observed for the main intended outcomes, with the overall results providing qualified support for the effectiveness of MePlusMe. The significant positive changes associated with use of this system are encouraging. Nonetheless, modest retention rates limit the precision and generalisability of these findings. Further investigation should ascertain optimal duration of engagement, most acceptable means of outcome assessment, and further detail about obstacles to utilisation.","Rhianna Goozee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-99E-5F6","20210402","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19; digital intervention; higher education institutions; mental health; students","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13473,""
"A pragmatic randomized wait-list controlled trial of a smartphone-based well-being training in public school system employees during the COVID-19 pandemic","While the extraordinary pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health have received considerable attention, less attention has been placed on the well-being of school system employees despite their vital role in society and the education of young people. The need for innovative mental health promotion strategies that are acceptable, accessible, and scalable has never been more evident. In a remote pragmatic randomized wait-list controlled trial of Wisconsin public school system employees (N=662) during the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigate a candidate program: a freely available four-week smartphone-based meditation app designed to train key constituents of well-being (Healthy Minds Program; HMP). Following our preregistered analysis plan and consistent with hypotheses, assignment to the HMP predicted significantly larger reductions in psychological distress, our primary outcome, at post-intervention (standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.52 95% CI [-0.68 to -0.37], P<0.0001) and at the three-month follow-up (SMD=-0.33 [-0.48 to -0.18], P<0.001). Also consistent with hypotheses, similar indications of immediate and sustained benefit following the HMP were observed on all six preregistered secondary outcomes selected to tap skills targeted in the app (absolute value SMDs=0.19 to 0.42, all Ps<0.031 corrected). Secondary outcomes included an antecedent to anxiety and depression (perseverative thinking) and a measure of loneliness. We found no evidence for elevated adverse effects in the HMP group and the HMP was at least as effective in subsample analyses involving participants with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms at baseline. These data suggest that the HMP has promise as an acceptable, accessible, and scalable mental health intervention.","Matthew J Hirshberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46068-649-CD1","20210330","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; covid-19 | mental health| psychological distress| mobile health | meditation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13474,""
"Parent and child mental health trajectories April-October 2020: Strict lockdown versus no lockdown in Australia","Objective: To control a second-wave COVID-19 outbreak, the state of Victoria in Australia experienced one of the worldâ€™s first long and strict lockdowns over July-October 2020, while the rest of Australia experienced â€˜COVID-normalâ€™ with minimal restrictions. We (1) investigate trajectories of parent/child mental health outcomes; and (2) identify baseline demographic, individual, and COVID-19-related factors associated with mental health trajectories. Method: Online community sample of 1,877 Australian parents with rapid repeated assessment over 10 time-points over April-October, 2020. Measures assessed parent mental health (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21); child depression symptoms (13-item Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire); and child anxiety symptoms (four-items from Brief Spence Childrenâ€™s Anxiety Scale). Results: Mental health trajectories shadowed COVID-19 infection rates. Victorians reported a large peak in mental health symptoms at the time of the second-wave lockdown compared to other states. Key baseline predictors, including parent and child loneliness (standardized regression coefficient [ÃŸ]=Â·09-Â·39), parent/child diagnoses (ÃŸ=Â·11-Â·22), couple conflict (ÃŸ=Â·09-Â·19), and COVID-19 stressors, such as worry/concern about COVID-19, illness, and loss of job (ÃŸ=Â·07-Â·22), predicted elevated trajectories. Effects of predictors on parent and child mental health trajectories are illustrated in an online interactive app for readers (https://lingtax.shinyapps.io/CPAS_trend/). Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence of worse trajectories of parent and child mental health symptoms associated with strict, sustained, COVID-19 lockdown in Victoria, compared to non-locked states in the rest of Australia. We identified several baseline factors that may be useful in detecting high risk families who are likely to require additional support early on in future lockdowns.","Elizabeth Westrupp et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-E8C-13D","20210326","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; parenting; child mental health; couple conflict; covid-19 pandemic; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13475,""
"Self-reported wellbeing and sample characteristics in a survey of 19000 school pupils during the first UK COVID-19 school closures","Abstract Background Understanding the impact of COVID-19 and associated school closures on the wellbeing of children and young people is important for guiding the provision of support for educational and wellbeing needs, and to prevent long-term negative impacts. Such insight can benefit most from research with large representative samples, which are difficult to capture via most means of recruitment. Methods We surveyed 19000 pupils in years 4-13 at schools or Further Education Colleges (FECs) in Southern England during the first period of UK COVID-19 partial school closures (June-July 2020). We asked participants to report how they perceived the impact of lockdown on wellbeing and lifestyle factors. We also collected information on key demographics and characteristics, to assess the representativeness of a sample that can be recruited via schools during a lockdown. Results Most responses were from pupils in years 7-10 and most were female and receiving educational provision from home during the first lockdown. The sample captured some responses from young people who said they felt unsafe at school or at home, and some who said they had self-harmed during lockdown. Compared to primary school pupils, responses from pupils at secondary school or FECs revealed higher percentages reporting negative impacts of lockdown, most notably to changes in general happiness, loneliness and management of school work. Conclusions Self-perceived changes to wellbeing by school pupils reveal negative impacts of school closures in terms of social deprivation and education on many pupils at secondary schools and FECs. The findings highlight that there have been both positive and negative impacts on the self-perceived wellbeing of school-aged children, with almost one third reporting sleeping and feeling better.","Karen Mansfield et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46242-038-77D","20210326","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; school; adolescents; wellbeing; lockdown; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13476,""
"Social network factors in university student well-being and resilience during a large-scale stressor","The transition to college is a challenging time during which many students suffer declines in well-being. Social connections play a key role in supporting mental health, but only tell part of the story of social life on campus. For instance, the personalities of oneâ€™s friends and neighbors on campus contribute to a â€œsocial microclimate.â€ Here, we quantify the collective impact of individual, social network, and community factors in the well-being of a first-year college cohort during (i) their first academic term and (ii) a stressor (the COVID-19 pandemic). Students who maintained supportive connections and belonged to emotionally stable and tight-knit microclimates reported greater well-being in their first academic term, and less anxiety when exposed to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of both personal relationships and community factors in supporting mental health.","Andrea Courtney et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E7-428-776","20210317","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; social environment; well-being; anxiety; social networks; mental health; depression; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13477,""
"The impact of lockdown stress and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among university students in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a shutdown of universities in Germany. In a longitudinal design, we compared mental health (depression, anxiety, somatic complaints) of university students in Germany before (June to August 2019) and in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020) with two online surveys. Additionally, we determined the impact of lockdown stress and loneliness on studentsâ€™ mental health. Among 443 participants (mean age 22.8 years), there were 77% female, and 10.4% medical students. Elevated levels of depression were reported more often during than before the pandemic (38.5% vs. 27.7%). Likewise, symptoms of anxiety (35.8% vs. 29.8%) and somatic complaints (32.3% vs. 27.5%) were more present in the course of the pandemic. A small increase of depression mean scores was observed, no significant changes of anxiety and somatic complaints became evident. Current loneliness and pre-pandemic distress represented the strongest associations with mental health during the pandemic. Pandemic-related psychosocial stress contributed indirectly to mental health through loneliness. The results imply increased levels of loneliness as the most substantial consequence of the pandemic. Given their high levels of pre-pandemic distress and pandemic-specific stress, university students represent a risk group for social and economic long-term ramifications of the pandemic.","Antonia M.

"Gender and Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Undergraduate and Graduate Studentsâ€™ Mental Health and Treatment Use amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: To investigate gender and racial/ethnic disparities in mental health and treatment use in college and graduate students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Based on a large-scale online survey (N = 1,415) administered during the weeks following a pandemic-related university-wide campus closure in March 2020, we examined gender and racial disparities in current internalizing severity and treatment use with t-tests and logistic regression models. Results: Specifically, we found that students with marginalized gender (e.g., woman [p < .001], non-binary gender [p < .001]) or Hispanic/Latinx identity (p = .002) reported higher levels of internalizing problem severity compared to their privileged counterparts (e.g., man, non- Hispanic/Latinx White). Regarding treatment use, Asian (p < .001) and multiracial students (p = .002) reported lower treatment use after controlling for internalizing problem severity. Internalizing severity was generally associated with higher treatment use (logit = 0.53, p = .001), indicating a match of objective needs with service use. However, this relationship was offset by a negative interaction between internalizing problem severity and Asian (logit = -0.49, p < .001) or Black identity (logit = -0.57, p = .03) in predicting treatment use. Conclusion: The findings revealed unique mental health challenges faced by different demographic groups and served as a call that specific actions to enhance mental health equity, such as continued mental health support for students with marginalized gender identities, additional COVID-related mental and practical support for Hispanic/Latinx students, and promotion of mental health awareness and trust in Asian/Black students, are desperately needed.","Sin-Ying Lin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-9A2-303","20210309","bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences; bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; pandemic; mental health equity; internalizing symptoms; race; marginalized identity; gender; ethnicity; treatment use; covid-19; minority","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13479,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic, Personality and Geriatric Population: Proposed Pragmatism","Elderly people are the most sensitive and delicate part of society who must bear the major burn of disruptive social behavior of human being amidst the 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Our aim was (1) to find out the root of disruption of societal integrity and self-centeredness by analyzing spokes of HEXACO; 2) to delineate its possible relationship with the formation of Neuroticism and eventually Psychopathy, and 3) to search for the potential ways to get rid of this darkness. Human civilization is experiencing unique psychosocial problems through emerging COVID 19. Depression, panic buying, herd behavior, yellow journalism, â€œinfodemicâ€ spreading through social media, immense sufferings of marginalized people, children and elderly, a surge of addictive behavior, racism, domestic violence, rape, divorce, financial constraints, and stigmatization, all possibly stem from a constellation of different negative human behaviors which probably originate from negative deflection of components of HEXACO model of personality towards the genesis of the dark triad. COVID-19 and surge of the dark triad in form of Neuroticism, Narcissism and Machiavellianism are causing major mental health threat.

"Design, content, and fieldwork procedures of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study â€“ Wave 4","Objectives: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the adult population in multiple countries. This paper describes the design and execution of the fourth wave of the UK survey (the â€˜parentâ€™ strand of the Consortium) during November-December 2020. Methods: This survey prioritised the collection of data pertaining to respondentsâ€™ socio-political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours, as well as core mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress). In Phase 1, adults (n=2878) were reinvited to participate in this wave. A new recruitment strand (Phase 2) oversampled respondents from Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland to facilitate robust between-country analyses for core study outcomes. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure that the cross-sectional sample is representative of the baseline sample characteristics (gender, age, household income, household composition, ethnicity, urbanicity, and born/raised in UK). Results: In Phase 1, 1796 adults were successfully recontacted and provided full interviews at Wave 4 (62.4% retention rate). Phase 2 recruitment achieved a robust sample of 1779 respondents from Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, who were largely representative of the socio-demographic and political characteristics of the adult populations in these nations. The raking procedure successfully re-balanced the cross-sectional sample to within 1% of population estimates across selected socio-demographic characteristics.

"Longitudinal change in adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic: A collaborative of 12 samples from 3 countries","This study aimed to examine changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from before to during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 1,339 adolescents from three countries (9-18 years old, 59% female). We also examined if age, race/ethnicity, disease burden, or strictness of government restrictions moderated change in symptoms. Data from 12 longitudinal studies (10 U.S., 1 Netherlands, 1 Peru) were combined. Linear mixed effect models showed that depression symptoms increased significantly (median increase=28%), whereas anxiety symptoms remained stable overall. The most negative mental health impacts were reported by multiracial adolescents and those under â€˜lockdownâ€™ restrictions. Policy makers need to consider these impacts by investing in ways to support adolescentsâ€™ mental health during the pandemic.","Marjolein Barendse et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604B-73A-69B","20210203","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; anxiety; adolescence; covid-19; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13482,""
"Racial Prejudice and Police Stops: A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature","A police stop must be based on founded suspicion, an officerâ€™s ability to correctly discriminate suspicious behavior. However, police stops can be influenced by negative attitudes towards Black individuals. We conducted a systematic review of empirical articles published from 2014 until 2019 that investigated the relationship between racial prejudice and police stops on PsycInfo, using keywords such as â€œraceâ€, â€œethnicâ€, â€œpolice stopâ€, â€œtraffic stopâ€, and â€œstop and friskâ€. Results included 16 studies conducted in the United States (US), England, Wales, and the Netherlands, and showed that: Black men were the most frequent targets of police stops; many individuals who have been stopped by the police reported negative perceptions of the police force; the Stop, Question, and Frisk strategy used by some US police departments proved to be a type of stop that favors racial selectivity; and that traffic stops were favorable environments for racially biased actions by officers. We conclude that institutional racism in police stops proves to be a problem shared by several countries, including Brazil. We suggest more investigations to characterize institutional racism in the police force and in other settings and interventions aimed at reducing individual biases and collective racist practices.","Aline Ara Carvalho et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-7CA-158","20210130","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Physiology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; stop and frisk; racial issues; police stop; racial prejudice; terry stop; systemic racism","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13483,""
"Short Research Report: Does Playing Apart Really Bring us Together? Investigating the Link Between Perceived Loneliness and the Use of Video Games During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries implemented social distancing measures to contain virus transmission. However, these vital safety measures have the potential to impair mental health or well-being, for instance, from increased perceived loneliness. Playing social video games may offer a way to continue to socialize while adhering to social distancing measures. To examine this issue further, the present online survey investigated social gaming during the pandemic and its association to perceived loneliness within a German-speaking sample. Results indicated a small positive correlation between general gaming frequency and perceived loneliness. Detailed analysis revealed a negative association between perceived loneliness and increased social forms of video gaming. Specifically, gamers with more social motive for gaming perceived less loneliness, but gamers with a dominant escape motive demonstrated a positive link to perceived loneliness. The use of social gaming in times of social distancing seems to play a small but significant factor in perceived loneliness compared to other demographical data. The findings are discussed with respect to methodological limitations, effect sizes, and sample characteristics. The results enrich the current knowledge on video gaming and its link to social well-being and provide a more nuanced picture than simplistic investigations of screen time.","Steve Nebel et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-7ED-338","20201209","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Physiology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13484,""
"Parental depressive and anxiety symptoms as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic: a birth cohort follow-up study","Background During the COVID-19, significant rises in psychiatric symptomatology have been reported. However, very few studies have examined change in symptoms in comparison to pre-pandemic levels. Especially parents of young children may be particularly vulnerable due, for example, homeschooling and other caregiving responsibilities. Aims We examined the change in depressive and anxiety symptoms from pre-pandemic to pandemic period among parents, and the factors explaining the symptom levels and within-subject change. Methods The sample (N=651) consists of parents recruited to the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in 2010-2015. Maternal and paternal depressive (EPDS) and anxiety symptoms (SCL-90) were measured using self-reports at 2 and 4 years of childâ€™s age and during the pandemic in May 2020 around two months after the first COVID-19 cases were identified in Finland. Results Higher symptom level was associated with COVID-related stressors, being mother (vs. father), prior symptoms and prior negative life events. Importantly, there was a significant increase in both depressive and anxiety symptoms and in subjects scoring above the screening cut-off of depression from pre-pandemic to pandemic. The significant within-subject increase in symptoms was predicted by experiencing pandemic restrictions affecting free time and prior negative life events. The increase in symptoms more pronounced in mothers (Cohenâ€™s d=0.38 and 0.30) versus fathers (Cohenâ€™s d=0.19 and .00). Conclusions A remarkable increase in symptoms is observed among parents in a general population sample. The study has implications for identifying parents as well as providing support for families in the face of pandemic.","Saara Nolvi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605D-570-E3B","20200922","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Couples, Marriage, and Family; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; child mental health; mental health; depression; parents; covid-19; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13485,""
"Empathy and its associations with sociodemographic and personality characteristics in a large UK population sample","Background Empathy is fundamental to social cognition, driving prosocial behaviour and mental health. Self-reported empathy varies across cultures and there are differing reports of associations with demographic characteristics. We therefore aimed in a UK survey to characterise two main self-reported components of empathy, namely empathic concern (feeling compassion) and perspective taking (understanding othersâ€™ perspective). We hypothesised that empathy would be associated with age, gender, ethnicity, relationship status, employment, socio-economic status, education, and personality. Methods We asked participants in the COVID-19 Social Study - an internet-based survey of UK-dwelling adults aged =18 years - to complete the Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscales measuring empathic concern and perspective taking, and sociodemographic and personality questionnaires. We weighted the sample to be UK population representative and employed multivariable weighted linear regression models. Results In 30,033 respondents, mean empathic concern score was 3.86 (95% confidence interval 3.85, 3.88) and perspective taking was 3.57 (3.56. 3.59), the correlation between these subscores was 0.45 (p < 0.001). In adjusted models, greater empathic concern was associated with female gender, non-white ethnicity, having more education, working in health, social-care, or childcare professions, and having higher neuroticism, extroversion, openness to experience and agreeableness traits. Perspective taking was associated with younger age, female gender, more education, employment in health or social-care, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness. Conclusions Women and people working in caring professions have higher empathy levels. Perspective taking declines with age but empathic concern does not. Empathic compassion and understanding are distinct dimensions of empathy with differential associations with demographic factors.","Andrew Sommerlad et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46071-782-BD3","20200916","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13486,""
"Families of Austerity: Intergenerational Spillovers of Income Loss in Great Britain","We study the intergenerational spillovers of income shocks. Compared to income boosts, income losses due to policy change have been seldom examined via an intergenerational lens. Besides, research on income boosts has centred around parental investments of time and money, and has largely focused on maternal inputs during early and middle childhood. To complement that, we show how income losses may spill over via financial hardship, psychological distress, and parenting. We consider both maternal and paternal inputs and highlight how shocks timed around childrenâ€™s adolescence can affect socio-emotional skills that are key to long-run outcomes. We analyse income losses following tax-benefit reform in Great Britain in the period 2009-2019 (UK Household Longitudinal Study). Based on an instrumental variable approach, our findings show that benefit income losses stiffened financial hardship, particularly in the form of housing arrears and subjective worries. These are accompanied by worsening maternal mental health, less effective parenting by both mothers and fathers, and increased problem behaviour among their adolescent children. Benefit income loss also seems to push parents into employment, but effects suggest neither a substantial re-direction of time from the household to the market nor do labour earnings offset benefit income losses money-wise. Findings thus speak to debates on the consequences and timing of income for children and family environments, bringing to the fore the intergenerational consequences of welfare cutbacks.","Gabriele Mari et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46094-643-6F7","20201007","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; intergenerational; child development; adolescence; timing of income; parenting; family income; welfare reform; mental health; family stress; income; instrumental variable; social policy; austerity; uk","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-05","",13487,""
