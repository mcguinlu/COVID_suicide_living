"GRATITUDE AND WELL-BEING DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MALAYSIA: MEDIATING ROLE OF RESILIENCE","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the well-being and mental health of people around the world. Positive emotions like resilience and gratitude have been proven to be able to improve oneâ€™s well-being. The theory of Broaden-and-build was used to explore resilienceâ€™s mediating role in the relationship between gratitude and well-being among Malaysian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data of 530 participants aged 18 to 35 years was analyzed using SmartPLS. The results showed that grateful and more resilient participants showed a better well-being, and the effects were further moderated by financial income and marital status. The results also supported the hypothetical statistical mediation model in which resilience is the statistical mediator for the association between gratitude and well-being. The results highlighted the significant influence of gratitude and resilience on Malaysian adultsâ€™ well-being and explained the role of gratitude in boosting their well-being. It is suggested that policymakers and mental health professionals should consider promoting gratitude and resilience to increase positive emotions and well-being in young adults and help society to be prepared for challenging times of adversity in the future.","Khodabakhsh, Sonia, Chia Sin, Ooi","https://doi.org/10.37708/psyct.v15i1.639","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychological Thought; 15(1):189-214, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31772,""
"WELL-BEING AND PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN: THE ROLE OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE, SELF-COMPASSION AND RUMINATION","The COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying restrictions, apart from the destructive global economic and social impact, brought negative psychological consequences to the world. The aim of the current study is to investigate the factors that help individuals maintain psychological well-being under the condition of self-isolation, a global restriction against the spread of the pandemic. Specifically, the role of trait emotional intelligence, self-compassion, and rumination was explored in order to determine how these variables relate to psychological well-being. According to the results, trait emotional intelligence and self-compassion positively correlate with psychological well-being, while rumination is negatively correlated. Self-compassion mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and well-being. The relationship between rumination and well-being is affected by emotional intelligence and self-compassion: Self-compassion mediates the relationship between depression related rumination and well-being, while self-control and emotionality factors of trait emotional intelligence moderate the relationship between reflection rumination and well-being. The findings of the current study provide insight about self-compassion, rumination, and emotional intelligence as different contributing factors to the individualsâ€™ well-being in self-isolation, suggesting further implications about the use of these strategies to help people cope with this stressful situation.","Martskvishvili, Khatuna, Lagidze, Nato","https://doi.org/10.37708/psyct.v15i1.623","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychological Thought; 15(1):105-131, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31773,""

"Nurses Psychological Well-Being During Covid19 Outbreak in Saudi Arabia","Background: The global coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) has caused health care provider to experience extraordinary psychological stress. Objective: This study assessed the psychological well-being of nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak and factors associated with it. Methods: An online survey was sent to all nurses working at the Ministry of Health Hospitals and living in Tabuk city, Saudi Arabia. A total of 219 nurses were completed the survey. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale -- 21 items (DASS-21) assessed the psychological well-being of respondents in the previous week. Results: One -quarter of nurses (24.7%) reported extremely severe symptoms of anxiety, more than one third (37%) reported extremely sever symptoms of stress, less than one quarter (14.1%) reported extremely sever symptoms of depression. Higher anxiety scores were significantly associated with direct contact with confirmed COVID 19 cases (p= 0.08), general health status (p= 0.001) and marital status (p= 0.042). Higher DASS-21 Stress scores were significantly associated with working more than eight hours per shift (p=0.024), marital status(P=0.036) and general health status (p &lt;0.001). Higher DASS-21 Depression scores was significantly associated general health status (p &lt;0.001). Conclusions & implication for practice: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant effect on the psychological well-being of Saudis nurses, particularly nurses who were married, had contact with COVID 19 cases, had working more than eight hours per shift, and had poor general health status.

"Start small and aim big in conducting a basic surgical skills workshop for medical students","Introduction: Medical students (MS) may lack the knowledge and experience in performing basic surgical skills (BSS) when they first commence their postgraduate surgical training. We conducted a pilot BSS workshop with specific learning outcomes for MS. Methods: Our BSS workshop program consisted of reading the pre-workshop online modules, watching the instructional videos of skills demonstration, and completing the pre-workshop multiple-choice questions (MCQ). MS attended the onsite workshop a week later, which consisted of a basic surgical theory lecture, live demonstration of the skills by the teaching faculty and, supervised skills training coupled with feedback. Surgical skills taught were knot tying, suturing techniques, laparoscopic peg transfer, precision cutting, application of endoloop ties. A standardised surgical skills rubric was used to assess the competency and safety of BSS. A post-workshop MCQ was administered to assess the knowledge learned. The criteria for successful completion of BSS were a satisfactory grade in the surgical skills assessment and a pass score in the MCQ. Results: All the participating MS achieved a satisfactory grade in the surgical skills assessment and passed the MCQ. Several pedagogical methods were used to enhance knowledge learning and practical skills competency including a flipped classroom in blended learning, technology-enhanced learning, kinesthetic learning, and providing effective feedback. Conclusion: MS taught in BSS workshop can achieve competency in knowledge, skills, safe attitude and prepare them for future postgraduate surgical training. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, our challenge is to develop similar BSS in a safe environment using technology-enhanced tools such as online instructional videos and online feedback.

"The Impact of Social Support on The Mental and Physical State of Patients with Epilepsy During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Background: Social support has a significant role for patients with chronic conditions like epilepsy. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on people around the world and is expected to have a greater impact on people with disabilities. As a part of our Covid-19 pandemic study, we're looking at the impact of social support on patients with epilepsy (PWE). Objective: This study aims to assess social support and its effects on PWE during the Covid-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: A total of 290 PWE were included in this study. Personal interviews with each patient were conducted using the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS 3) for measuring social support, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHO 9) scale for diagnosing and assessing the severity of depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale for diagnosing and assessing the severity of anxiety (GAD 7). Results: During the pandemic, we observed a decrease in family support for PWE, which was associated with an increase in depression and anxiety. As the pandemic spreads, we found that a lack of social support is linked to an increase in depressive symptoms and seizures. Conclusion: Social support plays an important role in psychological well-being and for a better course of disease in PWE.

"Mental Health Literacy: Strengthening Community Mental Health Through Awareness","According to WHO, mental health is the state of a person who realizes his potential, copes with stress factors, is productive and efficient in society, and maintains a state of internal balance (WHO 2012). According to the 2021 data of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), it was found that the number of people diagnosed with major depressive disorder increased by 28.1%, and the number of people diagnosed with anxiety by 27.9% compared to other years in the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators 2021). According to the health literacy study performed in our country, while 64.6% of the society was found to have a low level of health literacy (Tas ve Akis 2016, Kaya and Karaca Sivrikaya 2019), there was no study revealing the mental health literacy of the society. While there are some studies that reveal the mental health literacy of societies in the international literature (Reavley and Jorm 2011, Gulliver et al. 2017, Ratnayake and Hyde 2019), it is remarkable that there are only a limited number of studies examining the mental health literacy levels of healthcare professionals in our country (Ã–ztas and Aydogan 2021, Ã‡inÃ§inoglu and Okanli 2021).

"Evaluation of the condition of social processes based on qualimetric methods: The COVID-19 case","The Covid-19 pandemic mainly affected those target groups who, due to the nature of their duties, were unable to isolate themselves. The consequences of such work are psychological tension with various symptoms. In this situation, the formation of a system for localizing its consequences becomes a very important task. Three parts are distinguished: a quantitative assessment of the scale and nature of the pandemic, a quantitative assessment of the need to localize the consequences and the analysis of current system;third, the formation of a monitoring system. The chosen system allows verbal assessments to be transformed into quantitative ones. Based on it, the aggregated values of seven essential signs of psychological stress in the target groups (medical and social workers, police, customs officers, educators, pharmacists, and entrepreneurs) were identified: anxiety (0.80), stress (0.78), aggression (0.63), insomnia (0.62), persistent fatigue (0.61), depression (0.56), sadness (0.49). The application of the methodology allows forming a monitoring system considering the scale of the pandemic impact and the psychological consequences. The mental distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be characterized by such negative effects as anxiety, stress, insomnia, persistent fatigue, depression and persistent sadness. The study revealed that the major shortcomings in the system developed for localizing the negative effects are as follows: insufficient efforts of state institutions even in the case the negative effects are getting worse;inadequate provision of psychological assistance conditioned by unreasonably high prices and deficient legal framework.","Ginevicius, R.; TriÅ¡c, R.; Remeikiene, R.; Zielinska, A.; Strikaite-LatuÅ¡inskaja, G.","https://doi.org/10.14254/2071-8330.2022/15-1/15","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of International Studies; 15(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31783,""
"Correlation of Depression and Anxiety With Rheumatoid Arthritis","BackgroundPsychiatric comorbidity with a chronic disease is linked with poor patient outcomes. Therefore, the current research assessed the correlation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with depression and anxiety disorders.Â MethodologyA prospectiveÂ observational study was undertaken at a public sector hospital between December 2020 to June 2021. All individuals who presented with rheumatoid arthritis were included in the study. A healthy cohort acted as the control group. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and the Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAM-A), respectively. The patients were inquired about their gender, age, and duration of RA. Further stratification was done using the Chi-squared test. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was decided as the cut-off for significance. All data from the patients were collected in a predefined pro forma.Â ResultsA total of 169 patients with RA and 85 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The mean depression score among patients with RA was 19.65 Â± 1.44 versus 14.4 Â± 1.31 in the control group (p&lt;0.001). Moreover, the mean anxiety score in patients with RA was 19.44 Â± 2.4. About 71% of patients with RA were diagnosed with psychiatric issues, while only 7.1% of individuals in the control group had either depression or anxiety (p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, it was found that the majority of the patients with RA had depression with a frequency of 70 (58.3%), while only six participants in the control group had depression. None of the participants had moderate or severe depression. However, 16 (69.6%) patients with RA had major anxiety issues. In 27 patients, mixed anxiety-depression disease was diagnosed. Out of these, 23 (85.2%) had the depression-dominant mixed disorder.Â ConclusionThe present study highlighted the alarming incidence of depression and anxiety among patients with RA. Furthermore, it also indicated the relationship between severity of psychiatric comorbidity with chronic rheumatoid arthritis in our population. Further large-scale studies are needed to ascertain the demographic confounders that may help predict psychiatric disorders among patients with RA.","Jones Amaowei Emilia, E.; Anwar, Sana, Kavanoor Sridhar, Kumudhavalli, Khadeja, Shabbir, Mohammed, Ehtesham H.; Bahar Abdul, Rasheed, Talpur Abdul, Subhan, Bhat, Sadaf, Zafar, Shumaila, Qadar Laila, Tul","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.23137","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cureus; 14(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31784,""

"Internet, Mobile Device, Social Media Use, and Gaming Behavior During COVID-19: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies","This systematic review aimed to assess the pattern and factors associated with internet, mobile device, social media use, and gaming behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased internet, smartphone, social media use as well as online gaming were noted. Younger age group, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and stress were associated with an increase in internet, smartphone, and social media use. The majority of studies were of poor quality. These conclusions highlight the need to conduct research with robust methodology and implement public health initiatives which address those at greater risk to alleviate pathological use.

"Research highlights on kidney transplantation in 2021: voices from China","Over the past 70 years, kidney transplantation has become not only the most mature but also the highest-success-rate surgery among all organ transplantation surgeries. However, the long-term survival of kidney transplant recipients is still challenged by such key factors as ischemia-reperfusion injury related to kidney transplantation, rejection, chronic renal allograft dysfunction, renal allograft fibrosis, immunosuppressive therapy, infections and others. Relevant fundamental and clinical studies have emerged endlessly. At the same time, the research related to kidney transplantation also becomes a new hot spot accordingly in the context of the normalization of novel coronavirus pneumonia. This article reviewed the cutting-edge hot spots in relation to the fundamental and clinical aspects of kidney transplantation together with relevant new techniques and new visions. The studies included in this article focused on the reports published by Chinese teams that are more applicable to the current situation of kidney transplantation in China, for the purpose of providing new thoughts and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of kidney transplantation related issues in China.

"A Welcoming Space to Manage Crisis: The Wellness Respite Program","The need for behavioral health care prevention, treatment, and recovery supports, including crisis alternatives, has grown and is now receiving federal support through enhanced funding. When a person experiences severe emotional distress, crisis alternatives are a viable option instead of inpatient hospitalization to address the distress and restore balance. Peer respite programs are voluntary, short-term, crisis alternatives for people experiencing mental distress. Models have evolved in response to funding and regulatory requirements, yet research is limited. The current article describes a unique peer-led program, Wellness Respite, in operation for 7 years, including data from recent satisfaction surveys and the role of nurses in the program. Implications of a home-like, short-term crisis alternative and the role of the nurse are emphasized.

"Relationships between Coerced Sexting and Differentiation of Self: An Exploration of Protective Factors","Pressure to send sexually explicit messages, or â€˜sexting coercionâ€™ is associated with adverse mental health outcomes and sexual risk behaviors. This study explores Differentiation of Self (DoS) as a potential protective factor to reduce susceptibility to sexting coercion. A convenience sample of 399 Australian participants, aged 18 to 21 years (Mage = 19.63;SD = 1.14, 68.2% women) completed an online survey measuring sexting behaviors and DoS. Women were four times more likely to send willing unwanted sexts, and seven times more likely to engage in coerced unwanted sexting than men. Participants with low DoS were four times more likely to engage in coerced unwanted sexting. DoS significantly mediated the relationship between gender and coerced unwanted sexting. Results support the proposal of a sexting coercion typology encompassing discrete sub-types of sexting coercion. Results also indicate DoS may operate as a protective factor for young people in Australia, reducing compliance with sexting when coerced.","Laird, Jessica, Klettke, Bianca, Clancy, Elizabeth, Fuelscher, Ian","https://doi.org/10.3390/sexes2040037","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sexes; 2(4):468, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31790,""
"Association of low-grade glioma diagnosis and management approach with mental health disorders: a MarketScan analysis 2005-2014","Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) comprise 13-16% of glial tumors. As survival for LGG patients has been gradually improving, it is essential that the effects of diagnosis and disease progression on mental health be considered. This retrospective cohort study queried the IBM Watson Health MarketScanR Database to describe the incidence and prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs) among LGG patients and identify associated risk factors. Among the 20,432 LGG patients identified, 12,436 (60.9%) had at least one MHD. Of those who never had a prior MHD, as documented in the claims record, 1915 (16.7%) had their first, newly diagnosed MHD within 12 months after LGG diagnosis. Patients who were female (odds ratio (OR), 1.14, 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.03-1.26), aged 35-44 (OR, 1.20, 95% CI, 1.03-1.39), and experienced glioma-related seizures (OR, 2.19, 95% CI, 1.95-2.47) were significantly associated with MHD incidence. Patients who underwent resection (OR, 2.58, 95% CI, 2.19-3.04) or biopsy (OR, 2.17, 95% CI, 1.68-2.79) were also more likely to develop a MHD compared to patients who did not undergo a first-line surgical treatment. These data support the need for active surveillance, proactive counseling, and management of MHDs in patients with LGG. Impact of surgery on brain networks affecting mood should also be considered.","Bhanja, D.; Ba, D.; Tuohy, K.; Wilding, H.; Trifoi, M.; Padmanaban, V.; Liu, GuoDong, Sughrue, M.; Zacharia, B.; Leslie, D.; Mansouri, A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14061376","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cancers; 14(6), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31791,""
"Regular Low-Intensity Exercise Prevents Cognitive Decline and a Depressive-Like State Induced by Physical Inactivity in Mice: A New Physical Inactivity Experiment Model","Regular exercise has already been established as a vital strategy for maintaining physical health via experimental results in humans and animals. On the other hand, regarding physical inactivity, namely lack of physical activity, numerous human studies have reported that physical inactivity is a primary factor that causes obesity, muscle atrophy, metabolic diseases, and deterioration in cognitive function and mental health. However, an established animal experimental method to examine the effect of physical inactivity on physiological, biochemical, and neuroscientific parameters has yet to be reported. Here, we made a new rearing cage, named a physical inactivity cage (PI cage), for investigating the effect of physical inactivity on cognitive function and depressive-like state and obtained the following experimental results by its use. (1) Physical activity of mice in the PI cage was decreased to approximately half of that in the standard cage. (2) Physical inactivity via rearing in PI cages caused a cognitive decline and onset of a depressive-like state without increasing body weight and plasma corticosterone. (3) Physical inactivity decreased neuronal cell proliferation, blood vessel density, and gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. (4) Regular low-intensity exercise prevented cognitive decline and onset of a depressive-like state caused by physical inactivity. These results showed that rearing in the PI cage would be an adequate and valuable experimental method for examining the effect of physical inactivity on cognitive function and depressive-like state.","Kim, Jimmy, Park, Jonghyuk, Mikami, Toshio","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.866405","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience; 16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31792,""

"Use of laboratory data for illicit drug use surveillance and identification of socioeconomic risk factors","Drug overdose is the leading cause of death among people 25-44 years of age in the United States. Existing drug surveillance methods are important for prevention and directing treatment, but are limited by delayed reporting and lack of geographic granularity. Laboratory urine drug screen and complete metabolic panel data from patients presenting to the emergency department was used to observe long-term and short-term temporal and geospatial changes at the zip code-level in St. Louis. Multivariate linear regression was performed to investigate associations between zip code-level socioeconomic factors and drug screening positivity rates. An increase in the fentanyl positive drug screens was seen during the initial COVID-19 shutdown period in the spring of 2020. A decrease in cocaine positivity was seen in the fall and winter of 2020, with a return to baseline coinciding with the second major COVID-19 shutdown in the summer of 2021. These changes appeared to be independent of changes in emergency department utilization as measured by complete metabolic panels ordered. Significant short-term changes in fentanyl and cocaine positivity rates between specific time periods were able to be localized to individual zip codes. Zip code-level multivariate analysis demonstrated independent associations between socioeconomic/demographic factors and fentanyl/cocaine positivity rates as determined by laboratory drug screening data. Analyzing clinical laboratory drug screening data can enable a more temporally and geographically granular view of population-level drug use surveillance. Additionally, laboratory data can be utilized to find population-level socioeconomic associations with illicit drug use, presenting a potential avenue for the use of this data to guide public health and healthcare policy decisions.","Azimi, Jackups, Farnsworth, Budelier","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109499","20220523","Big Data; Illicit drug use; Laboratory surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31795,""
"Disentangling the associations between past childhood adversity and psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating roles of specific pandemic stressors and coping strategies","Individuals with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) display heightened symptoms of psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, no study has investigated what aspects of the pandemic are of particular concern for this population and ways in which strategies to coping with pandemic stressors may exacerbate their clinical symptomatology. This study explores what pandemic stressors and coping strategies are associated with ACEs, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic, before investigating whether the identified chief stressors and coping styles mediate the effects of ACEs on depression and PTSD. 1107 Greek adults were sampled from the general population. Participants completed the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5, Pandemic Stressor Scale, and Brief Cope Scale. ACEs and depression were both predominantly associated with difficult housing conditions as a stressor (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.079, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001 and bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.046, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, respectively), whereas PTSD was mainly related to fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.065, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Self-blame was the main coping strategy associated with both ACEs (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.046, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .010), depression (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.071, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0005), and PTSD (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.088, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0005). Difficult housing conditions and self-blame further demonstrated a significant serial mediation effect in the relationship between ACEs with both depression (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.105, 95% CI [0.0607, 0.158]) and PTSD (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.019, 95% CI [0.011, 0.031]). The findings indicate that policy makers should identify ways of ameliorating challenging housing conditions, and that service providers should target self-blame in the psychological treatment of adults with ACEs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jernslett, Anastassiou-Hadjicharalambous, Lioupi, Syros, Kapatais, Karamanoli, Evgeniou, Messas, Palaiokosta, Papathanasiou, Lotzin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105673","20220523","Adverse childhood experiences; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Difficult housing conditions; PTSD; Self-blame","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31796,""
"Differences in clinical presentation with long covid following community and hospital infection, and associations with all-cause mortality: English sentinel network database study","Most studies of long covid (symptoms of COVID-19 beyond 4 weeks) have focused on people hospitalised in their initial illness. Long covid is thought to be under-recorded in UK primary care electronic records. We sought to determine which symptoms people present to primary care following COVID-19, and whether presentation differs in people who were not hospitalised, and post-long covid mortality. We used routine data from the nationally representative Primary Care Sentinel Cohort of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (N=7.4million), applying a pre-defined long covid phenotype and grouped by whether the illness index was in hospital or community. We included COVID-19 cases between 1st-March-2020 and 1st-April-2021. We conducted a before and after analysis of pre-specified long covid symptoms identified by the Office of National Statistics, comparing symptoms presented between one and six months after their index infection matched with the same months one year previously. We conducted logistic regression analysis, quoting odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, reporting differences between those with an index community infection compared to those who had been hospitalised, and separately associations with all-cause mortality. 5.6% (416,505/7,396,702) and 1.8% (7,623/416,505) of patients respectively had a coded diagnosis of COVID-19 and diagnosis or referral for long covid. People coded as having long covid were significantly more likely to have presented the pre-specified symptoms after vs before COVID-19 infection (odds ratios 2.66 [2.46-2.88] for those with index community infection and 2.42 [2.03-2.89] for those hospitalised). Following an index community infection, patients were more likely to present with non-specific symptoms (odds ratio 3.44 [3.00-3.95], P&lt;.001) than following a hospital admission (odds ratio 2.09 [1.56-2.80], P&lt;.001). Mental health sequelae were more commonly associated with hospital admission index infections (odds ratio 2.21 [1.64-2.96]) compared to community (odds ratio 1.36 [1.21-1.53], P&lt;.001). People presenting to primary care following hospital infection were more likely to be male (odds ratio 1.43 [1.25-1.64], P&lt;.001), more socioeconomically deprived (odds ratio 1.42 [1.24-1.63], P&lt;.001); and to have multi-morbidity (odds ratio 1.41 [1.26-1.57], P&lt;.001) than those presenting after an index community infection. All-cause mortality in people with long covid was associated with increasing age; male gender (odds ratio 3.32 [1.34-9.24], P&lt;.01) and higher multi-morbidity score (odds ratio 2.11 [1.34-3.29], P&lt;.001). One or more vaccine doses was associated with reduced odds of mortality (odds ratio 0.10 [0.03-0.35], P&lt;.001). The low percentage of people recorded as having long covid following COVID-19 reflects either low prevalence or under-recording. The characteristics and comorbidities of those presenting with long covid following a community infection are different from those who were hospitalised with their index infection. This study provides insights into the presentation of long covid in primary care and implications for workload.

"Development of a pharmacist-managed protocol for the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin in critically ill adults","In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pharmacist-managed protocol for transitioning critically ill patients from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous insulin. This single-center, retrospective, observational study included patients admitted to the medical or surgical/trauma intensive care unit who received a continuous infusion of IV insulin from January 2019 to April 2021. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 years old, pregnant, or incarcerated or received IV insulin for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, calcium channel blocker or ÃŽÂ²-blocker overdose, or hypertriglyceridemia. The primary outcome was to evaluate the percentage of blood glucose (BG) concentrations within the target range of 70 to 150Ã‚Â mg/dL within 48 hours of the transition to subcutaneous insulin. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of BG concentrations within the goal range following transition at 0 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours, the incidence of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and the percentage of patients requiring dose adjustments after the initial transition. Pharmacists were able to achieve BG concentrations in the target range for 53% of transitions at 12 hours, 40% of transitions at 24 hours, and 47% of transitions at 48 hours. With respect to safety endpoints, the pharmacist-managed group had a low rate of hypoglycemia (1.0%) and no severe hypoglycemia.

"Traumatization, Not Habituation: The Impact of a Long Lockdown on Mental Health and the Role of Media Use","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Czech population experienced a second lockdown lasting for about half a year, restricting free movement, and imposing social isolation. It is not known whether the impact of the long lockdown resulted in habituation to the adverse situation or in the traumatization of the Czech population, and whether the media and its specific use contributed to these processes. This study aimed at elucidating the effect of the long lockdown on the mental health of the Czech population, and the role of exposure to COVID-19 news reports and specific forms of media news use in mental health. We conducted two consecutive surveys in the early (November 2020) and late (March/April 2021) phases of the nationwide lockdown on the same nationally representative group of Czech adults (N = 1,777) participating in a longitudinal panel study. Our findings show that the self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression increased in the second observed period, whereby confirming the negative effect of the pandemic lockdown as it unfolded, suggesting that restrictive measures and continuous exposure to a collective stressor did not result in strengthening of resilience but rather in ongoing traumatization. The results also suggest a negative role of the media's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in mental health during the early, and particularly late phase of the lockdown. Furthermore, we found several risk and protective factors of specific media news use. The media practice in news consumption connected to social media use was the strongest predictor of exacerbated mental health symptoms, particularly in the late phase of the lockdown. Also, news media use characterized by internalization of information learned from the news, as well as negative attitudes towards media news, were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. On the other hand, the use of infotainment, together with an in-depth and contextual style of reading news articles, were related to improvement of mental health. Our study showed that the long lockdown resulted in traumatization rather than habituation, and in more pronounced effects (both negative and positive) of media use in mental health.","GrygarovÃƒÂ¡, AdÃƒÂ¡mek, JurÃƒÂ­Ã„ÂkovÃƒÂ¡, HorÃƒÂ¡Ã„Âek, BakÃ…Â¡tein, FajnerovÃƒÂ¡, Kesner","https://doi.org/10.2196/36050","20220523","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31799,""
"Symptoms of psychological distress amongst women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia","Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, several countries are still struggling to contain its spread. Apart from economic challenges, the pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health and psychological well-being of millions of people worldwide. The effects of COVID-19 are disproportionate depending on sociodemographic characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on psychological distress among women in Saudi Arabia. Data were extracted from an online cross-sectional self-reported questionnaire conducted to measure symptoms of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia from 3 May to 8 May 2020. The study included a sample of 1527 women. The questionnaire was based on the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) tool to categorise women who responded to the questionnaire as experiencing normal, mild, or severe levels of distress. Sociodemographic factors related to different levels of psychological distress among women were examined using descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regression models. Overall, 44% of the respondents indicated symptoms of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 36% of women showed symptoms of mild psychological distress, with 8% of women experiencing a severe distress level. The results also revealed particularly high levels of psychological distress among younger women and female healthcare workers. The COVID-19 pandemic highly contributes to psychological distress among women in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, it is essential to establish medium- and long-term strategies that target the most vulnerable women affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Qattan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268642","20220523","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31800,""
"Mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis","This systematic review aims to 1) summarize the prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, insomnia, and PTSD in the adult population during the first year of the COVID pandemic in developing countries and 2) uncover and highlight the uneven distribution of research on mental health in all developing countries across regions. Several literature databases were systemically searched for meta-analyses published by September 22, 2021, on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms in developing countries worldwide. We meta-analysed the raw data of the individual empirical results from the previous meta-analysis papers in developing countries in different regions. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were summarized based on 341 empirical studies with a total of 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°704Ã¢â‚¬â€°072 participants from 40 out of 167 developing countries in Africa, Asia (East, Southeast, South, and West), Europe, and Latin America. Comparatively, Africa (39%) and West Asia (35%) had the worse overall mental health symptoms, followed by Latin America (32%). The prevalence rates of overall mental health symptoms of medical students (38%), general adult students (30%), and frontline health care workers (HCWs) (27%) were higher than those of general HCWs (25%) and general populations (23%). Among five mental health symptoms, distress (29%) and depression (27%) were the most prevalent. Interestingly, people in the least developing countries suffered less than those in emergent and other developing countries. The various instruments employed lead to result heterogeneity, demonstrating the importance of using the well-established instruments with the standard cut-off points (eg, GAD-7, GAD-2, and DASS-21 for anxiety, PHQ-9 and DASS-21 for depression, and ISI for insomnia). The research effort on mental health in developing countries during COVID-19 has been highly uneven in the scope of countries and mental health outcomes. This meta-analysis, the largest on this topic to date, shows that the mental health symptoms are highly prevalent yet differ across regions. The accumulated systematic evidence from this study can help enable the prioritization of mental health assistance efforts to allocate attention and resources across countries and regions.","Chen, Zhang, Yin, YÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez","https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.12.05011","20220523","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31801,""
"Psychological Distress and Work-Related Quality of Life Among Oncology Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Oncology nurses are at disproportionate risk for psychological distress because they often encounter ethical challenges and deaths while providing care. Exposures to emergent suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic compound their chronic distress, which likely increased their vulnerability to psychological distress and may increase their risk for reduced work-related quality of life (WRQOL). This study examined the association between psychological distress and WRQOL among oncology nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional analysis of psychological distress and WRQOL among oncology nurses (N = 63) was conducted. The mean Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale score was 33.4, showing low depression levels, mild anxiety, and mild stress. The mean PTSD score was 29.3, and the mean WRQOL Scale score was 78.8. Depression, anxiety, and stress were strongly correlated to PTSD, and WRQOL was negatively correlated to PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress.","Eche, Eche, Aronowitz","https://doi.org/10.1188/22.CJON.268-274","20220523","COVID-19 pandemic; oncology nurses; psychological distress; work-related quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31802,""
"Mental health screening of patients with cystic fibrosis through telehealth during COVID-19: Evaluation of feasibility and process adoption","Persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) have higher rates of depression and anxiety compared to the general population. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines recommend annual screening for depression and anxiety for people with CF. COVID-19 and related social distancing has created challenges for administration of mental health screening by CF centers. The aim of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing mental health screening during multidisciplinary telehealth appointments for adult patients with CF during COVID-19, adoption of screening by CF mental health providers, and patient screening results before and after introduction of telehealth. Patients were screened via telehealth using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 between April and October 2020. CF mental health providers implemented a mental health screening process via telehealth and 93.9% of patients seen during that time completed the screening. The screening did not increase clinic visit length and no significant differences were found between rates of depression and anxiety and 2019 clinic rates. Implementation of mental health screening during a multidisciplinary telehealth clinic is feasible and can be adopted by providers and patients, even when health systems operations are impacted by COVID-19. It allows CF centers to maintain adherence to mental health screening and treatment guidelines. This method of screening can be applied to other patient populations and systems of care to expand access to mental health services during COVID-19 and beyond.

"Mental Health and Well-Being Trends Through the First Year-and-a-Half of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from a Longitudinal Study of Young Adults in the USA","This study examined longitudinal trajectories of young adults' mental health and well-being before and throughout the first year-and-a-half of the COVID-19 pandemic. Repeated assessments of a young adult community cohort (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°656; M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.6Ã‚Â years; 59.3% female) were conducted beginning prior to COVID-19 (January 2020) and extending through August 2021.

Depression symptoms and loneliness increased significantly in the first segment, plateaued slightly, then decreased significantly across the final segment. Anxiety symptoms were unchanged across the first two segments, but significantly decreased in the final segment. Satisfaction with life decreased significantly across the first two segments, and then increased significantly in the final segment. Direct comparisons of pre-pandemic scores (January 2020) to the last follow-up (July or August 2021) showed a return to pre-pandemic levels of depression symptoms, loneliness, and satisfaction with life, as indicated by non-significant differences, and significantly lower anxiety symptoms, relative to pre-pandemic. Findings support concerns for young adults' mental health and well-being in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also indicate that young adults' emotional well-being, on average, may be returning to pre-pandemic levels.","Graupensperger, Calhoun, Fleming, Rhew, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-022-01382-4","20220523","Anxiety; Depression; Emerging adulthood; Loneliness; Satisfaction with Life; Spline growth models","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31804,""
"Beyond Stress: Altered Sleep-Wake Patterns are a Key Behavioral Risk Factor for Acute Insomnia During Times of Crisis","Stress is a common precipitant of acute insomnia; however, reducing stress during times of crisis is challenging. This study aimed to determine which modifiable factors, beyond stress, were associated with acute insomnia during a major crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic. A global online survey assessed sleep/circadian, stress, mental health, and lifestyle factors between April-May 2020. Logistic regression models analyzed data from 1319 participants (578 acute insomnia, 741 good sleepers), adjusted for demographic differences. Perceived stress was a significant predictor of acute insomnia during the pandemic (OR 1.23, 95% CI1.19-1.27). After adjusting for stress, individuals who altered their sleep-wake patterns (OR 3.36, CI 2.00-5.67) or increased technology use before bed (OR 3.13, CI 1.13-8.65) were at increased risk of acute insomnia. Other sleep factors associated with acute insomnia included changes in dreams/nightmares (OR 2.08, CI 1.32-3.27), increased sleep effort (OR 1.99, CI1.71-2.31) and cognitive pre-sleep arousal (OR 1.18, CI 1.11-1.24). For pandemic factors, worry about contracting COVID-19 (OR 3.08, CI 1.18-8.07) and stringent government COVID-19 restrictions (OR 1.12, CIÃ‚Â =1.07-1.18) were associated with acute insomnia. Anxiety (OR 1.02, CI 1.01-1.05) and depressive (OR 1.29, CI 1.22-1.37) symptoms were also risk factors. A final hierarchical regression model revealed that after accounting for stress, altered sleep-wake patterns were a key behavioral predictor of acute insomnia (OR 2.60, CI 1.68-5.81). Beyond stress, altered sleep-wake patterns are a key risk factor for acute insomnia. Modifiable behaviors such as maintaining regular sleep-wake patterns appear vital for sleeping well in times of crisis.","Meaklim, Junge, Varma, Finck, Jackson","https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2022.2074996","20220523","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31805,""
"Psychological distress and fear of Covid-19 in student nurses before clinical placement: a cross-sectional study","To determine the degree of psychological distress and fear of COVID-19 experienced by undergraduate student nurses who were about to begin their clinical placements. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 100 second- and third-year undergraduate student nurses of the University of Zaragoza (Spain). Measures included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. Regularly, student nurses did not think of themselves as vulnerable to COVID-19. However, a significant association was observed between the student nurses' level of psychological distress and cohabiting with relatives or people who were considered vulnerable to the infection (p = 0.035). The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale results revealed a low level of psychological distress in general; the Fear of COVID-19 Scale indicated moderate fear (2.94). Student nurses who lived with their relatives experienced higher levels of stress due to the perceived risk of transmission, but were less fearful of loss of work and income. Anxiety in our sample was associated principally with not knowing their upcoming placement location.","BelÃƒÂ©n SubirÃƒÂ³n-Valera, Carmen Lucha-LÃƒÂ³pez, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Roca, Urcola-Pardo, Anguas-Gracia, JosÃƒÂ© SatÃƒÂºstegui-Dorda, Teresa FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Rodrigo, AntÃƒÂ³n-Solanas","https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-220X-REEUSP-2021-0548en","20220523","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31806,""
"Neural markers of emotion regulation difficulties moderate effects of COVID-19 stressors on adolescent depression","Stressful events, such as those imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, are associated with depression risk, raising questions about processes that make some people more susceptible to the effects of stress on mental health than others. Emotion regulation may be a key process, but methods for objectively measuring emotion regulation abilities in youth are limited. We leveraged event-related potential (ERP) measures and a longitudinal study of adolescents oversampled for depression and depression risk to examine emotion regulation difficulties as prospective predictors of depressive symptoms in response to pandemic-related stress. Before the pandemic, adolescents with (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28) and without (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34) clinical depression (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°62 total) completed an explicit emotion regulation task while ERP data were recorded and measures of depressive symptoms. Adolescents were re-contacted during the pandemic to report on COVID-19 related stressful events and depressive symptoms (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°48). Adolescents who had never experienced a depressive episode showed an increase in depressive symptoms during the pandemic, but adolescents who were clinically depressed before the pandemic did not exhibit significant changes in symptoms. Neural markers of emotion regulation abilities interacted with pandemic-related stressful events to predict depressive symptoms during the pandemic, such that stressors predicted increases in depressive symptoms only for adolescents with greater difficulty modulating responses to negative images before the pandemic. Results provide insight into adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the role of emotion regulatory brain function in risk and resilience for depression.","Gupta, Dickey, Kujawa","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23268","20220523","COVID-19 pandemic; depression; emotion regulation; event-related potentials; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31807,""
"Antecedents of COVID-19 rumination: A three-wave study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of our lives and has caused a considerable rise in psychological complaints such as anxieties and depression. The majority of studies so far has focused on outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic. To augment current knowledge, we focus on the antecedents of COVID-19 rumination. Specially, we examine how negative and positive work events prior to the outbreak influence individuals' coping capacity with regard to COVID-19 (i.e., the extent to which individuals have recurrent negative thoughts about COVID-19). Drawing on Conservation of Resources Theory (COR), we maintain that positive and negative work events prior to the pandemic can affect one's self-efficacy experiences and in turn can impact recurrent negative thoughts about COVID-19. Alongside exploring the proposed theoretical mediation model, we test one of the key assumptions of the COR theory: the notion of primacy of negative over positive affect that results from negative (vs. positive) work events. Three-waved data was collected among Dutch employees (T1Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°302; T2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°199; T3Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°171); two prior to the pandemic and one at the onset of the outbreak. Results showed that positive work events increased self-efficacy, which in turn reduced COVID-19 rumination. Contrary to the expectation of primacy of the effects of negative work events, we found no significant impact of negative work events on individuals' COVID-19 rumination.","CaniÃƒÂ«ls, Nikolova, Hatak, de Weerd-Nederhof","https://doi.org/10.1111/sjop.12832","20220523","COVID-19; positive and negative events; rumination; self-efficacy; work events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31808,""

"Improving vaccination coverage and offering vaccine to all school-age children allowed uninterrupted in-person schooling in King County, WA: Modeling analysis","The rapid spread of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants combined with slowing pace of vaccination in Fall 2021 created uncertainty around the future trajectory of the epidemic in King County, Washington, USA. We analyzed the benefits of offering vaccination to children ages 5-11 and expanding the overall vaccination coverage using mathematical modeling. We adapted a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to data from King County, Washington, to simulate scenarios of vaccinating children aged 5-11 with different starting dates and different proportions of physical interactions (PPI) in schools being restored. Dynamic social distancing was implemented in response to changes in weekly hospitalizations. Reduction of hospitalizations and estimated time under additional social distancing measures are reported over the 2021-2022 school year. In the scenario with 85% vaccination coverage of 12+ year-olds, offering early vaccination to children aged 5-11 with 75% PPI was predicted to prevent 756 (median, IQR 301-1434) hospitalizations cutting youth hospitalizations in half compared to no vaccination and largely reducing the need for additional social distancing measures over the school year. If, in addition, 90% overall vaccination coverage was reached, 60% of remaining hospitalizations would be averted and the need for increased social distancing would almost certainly be avoided. Our work suggests that uninterrupted in-person schooling in King County was partly possible because reasonable precaution measures were taken at schools to reduce infectious contacts. Rapid vaccination of all school-aged children provides meaningful reduction of the COVID-19 health burden over this school year but only if implemented early. It remains critical to vaccinate as many people as possible to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with future epidemic waves.","Bracis, Moore, Swan, Matrajt, Anderson, Reeves, Burns, Schiffer, Dimitrov","https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2022266","20220523"," COVID-19 vaccination ;  age structured model ;  epidemiology ;  mathematical modeling ;  variants of concern ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31810,""

People with alcohol dependence went into withdrawal as a result of the lockdown and acute lack of alcohol availability, which led to black marketing and, in extreme cases, suicide. On the other hand, De-addiction services in India were not adequately equipped for the SUD pandemic, and as a result, most services could not cope with lockdown problems. To generate revenue and to get out of this Catch-22 situation, the Government opened liquor shops and sold alcohol while people purchased it as usual because of excess stress, lack of social contact, loneliness and boredom.

"COVID-19 and Anxiety in Perinatal Women","<b>Introduction:</b> With a global pandemic like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading across borders, creating an extensive fear amongst all groups alike due to the increased morbidity and mortality, there is uncertainty in all patients affected. The government policy of quarantine of pregnant and postnatal women with COVID-19 in hospitals leads to ironic isolation and loneliness, mounting anxiety and fear of unknown outcomes. This study was undertaken to assess maternal anxiety in relation to COVID-19 and to observe factors influencing anxiety, drawing on anxiety scoring scales and a comparison of the levels of anxiety between antenatal and postnatal mothers. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 123 perinatal women with COVID-19 and their levels of anxiety were assessed on the basis of a pre-formed questionnaire, using the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Questionnaire (GAD-7). The levels of anxiety between antenatal and postnatal mothers were compared based on these 2 scoring systems, using IBM.SPSS statistics software Version23.0. <b>Results:</b> Although both groups were having high scores of anxiety, antenatal women were found to possess statistically significant higher level of anxiety, compared to postnatal women, as determined by CAS. <b>Conclusion:</b> Better assessment on antenatal and postnatal women will lead to need-based counselling from healthcare workers during their hospital stay and better use of resources for the identification of the vulnerable group and their management.","Najam, Chawla, Lalwani, Varshney, Singh Parmar","https://doi.org/10.34172/jcs.2022.07","20220523","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Mental health; Perinatal; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31813,""

Mean age and body mass index were 41.97Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.9Ã‚Â years and 26Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Most participants were married (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°486, 56.6%), living in the city (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°646, 75.3%), and white (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°442, 51.5%). The prevalence of insomnia, anxiety, and depression was 19.5% (ISIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°7), 6.6% (GAD-2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°3), and 4.8% (PHQ-2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°3), respectively. Compared to the insomnia group, the mean and median ISI, PHQÃ¢â‚¬â€˜4, PHQÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2, and GADÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 scores of the non-insomnia group were lower, while their mean and median quality of life and quality of health scores were significantly higher (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed aÃ‚Â positive correlation between the ISI and PHQÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.521, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), GADÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.483, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and PHQÃ¢â‚¬â€˜4 scores (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.562, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); however, the ISI score negatively correlated with the quality of life (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.490, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and quality of health scores (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.437, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Insomnia, anxiety, and depression were very prevalent during the pandemic. Anxiety and depression were more severe in the insomnia than in the non-insomnia group, and insomnia and mental health are closely related. Diese Studie untersucht die ZusammenhÃƒÂ¤nge zwischen Schlaflosigkeit und psychischen Gesundheitsfaktoren wÃƒÂ¤hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie in Deutschland. Der internetbasierte Fragebogen der Internationalen COVID-19-Schlafstudie (ICOSS), der auch soziodemographische Fragen sowie schlaf- und emotionsbezogene Skalen enthielt, wurde wÃƒÂ¤hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie vom 1.Ã‚Â Mai bis 30.Ã‚Â September 2020 in Deutschland verteilt. Schlaflosigkeit und psychischer Zustand wurden mit dem Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), dem Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), der Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) und der visuellen Analogskala erfasst. Qualitative Analysen der demographischen Merkmale wurden durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt und Korrelationsanalysen der Variablen berechnet. Insgesamt nahmen 1103Ã‚Â Personen an der Studie teil und 858Ã‚Â gÃƒÂ¼ltige FragebÃƒÂ¶gen (70,61Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% Frauen) wurden ausgefÃƒÂ¼llt.

"What Happened Next? The Experiences of Postsecondary Students With Disabilities as Colleges and Universities Reconvened During the Pandemic","COVID-19 caused nearly every college and university in the United States to rapidly shift to remote learning during the spring 2020 semester. While this impacted all students to different degrees, students with disabilities (SWD) faced new challenges related to their mental health, the accessibility of their instruction, the receipt of accommodations, and their interactions with faculty and student support personnel. Literature is emerging that describes the experiences of SWD during the spring 2020 semester and the swift change to remote learning. However, little is currently known about what followed for these students. The present study builds from a prior investigation of SWD during the spring 2020 semester and examines student experiences and perceptions during the 2020-2021 academic year. Eighty-eight SWD from colleges across the United States completed an instrument that contained a mix of demographic, yes/no, Likert scale and open-ended items. Responses revealed most items related to accessing services and instruction showed no improvement from the spring 2020 semester, and that items related to mental health, motivation to learn, and connections with peers were perceived as worse than in spring 2020. Open-ended responses revealed similar themes, with some students describing no improvements, and others noting that accessibility service offices and faculty provided enhanced methods of communication and support. Implications for practice and future research are presented.","Madaus, Faggella-Luby, Dukes, Gelbar, Langdon, Tarconish, Taconet","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.872733","20220523","COVID-19; accessibility; college students with disabilities; instruction; postsecondary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31815,""
"Tackling Explicit Material from Online Video Conferencing Software for Education Using Deep Attention Neural Architectures","The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic affected all areas of social life, especially education. Globally, many states have closed schools temporarily or imposed local curfews. According to UNESCO estimations, approximately 1.5 billion students have been affected by the closure of schools and the mandatory implementation of distance learning. Although rigorous policies are in place to ban harmful and dangerous content aimed at children, there are many cases where minors, mainly students, have been exposed relatively or unfairly to inappropriate, especially sexual content, during distance learning. Ensuring minors' emotional and mental health is a priority for any education system. This paper presents a severe attention neural architecture to tackle explicit material from online education video conference applications to deal with similar incidents. This is an advanced technique that, for the first time in the literature, proposes an intelligent mechanism that, although it uses attention mechanisms, does not have a square complexity of memory and time in terms of the size of the input. Specifically, we propose the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the help of a local, sparse attention mechanism, which can accurately detect obscene and mainly sexual content in streaming online video conferencing software for education.","Yang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6334802","20220523","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31816,""
"Contrasting Association Between COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Mental Health Status in India and Saudi Arabia-A Preliminary Evidence Collected During the Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic","Vaccine hesitancy is a global public health threat. Understanding the role of psychological factors in vaccine hesitancy is often neglected and relatively less explored. To analyze the relationship between mental health and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy before and after the advent of COVID-19 vaccines (AC19V) in the general population of India and Saudi Arabia (KSA) which vary in severity of the pandemic and vaccine mandates. A total of 677 adult participants from India and KSA participated in this cross-sectional online web-based survey. Sociodemographic details and current COVID-19 status pertaining to infection and vaccination were collected. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and perceptive need for mental health support (MHS) were assessed before and after AC19V. A newly constructed and validated COVID19 vaccine hesitancy scale-12 (COVID19-VHS12) scale was used to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Prevalence and levels of depression and anxiety symptoms decreased significantly in Saudis but not in Indians after AC19V. PTSD symptoms showed a significant reduction in both India and KSA. Anxiety symptoms were higher in KSA than India before AC19V while PTSD was higher in India before and after AC19V. Except for the place of residence and employment status, the subgroups of sociodemographic variables which were at higher risk of negative mental health before AC19V showed improvement in their mental health after AC19V. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in India and KSA was 50.8% (95% CI 45.73-55.89%) and 55.7% (95% CI 50.16-61.31%), respectively. A bidirectional association between vaccine hesitancy and mental health was observed in KSA but not in India. Higher vaccine hesitancy favored higher levels of depression, anxiety, and perceptive need for MHS and vice versa in KSA. None of the mental health parameters predicted vaccine hesitancy in India, while higher vaccine hesitancy increased the risk of anxiety. Vaccine hesitancy has a negative impact on mental health and vice versa over and above the impact of sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 vaccination and infection status which shows variations between India and KSA.","Jayakumar, Ilango, Kumar K, Alassaf, Aljabr, Paramasivam, Mickeymaray, Hawsah, Aldawish","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.900026","20220523","COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale; COVID-19 vaccines; PTSD; anxiety; depression; mental health; mental health support; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31817,""

"Associations Between Online Learning, Smartphone Addiction Problems, and Psychological Symptoms in Chinese College Students After the COVID-19 Pandemic","Smartphone-based online education gained popularity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Although recent studies have highlighted the association between problematic smartphone use (PSU) and mental health symptoms, the potential role of online learning in this relationship remains unclear. This study aimed <b>t</b>o analyze the relationships between higher education modes, PSU, and related psychological symptoms in university students. A total of 1,629 Chinese university students from five provinces completed a web-based questionnaire survey between March 2020 and October 2021. Demographic characteristics and learning conditions were recorded. All participants completed the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Athens Insomnia Scale. Multiple regressions models and stratified analyses were used to examine the association between online education mode, PSU, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. The prevalence of PSU was 58.5%. Students who relied primarily on online learning had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms (29.95% vs. 22.24%), anxiety symptoms (25.13% vs. 18.91%), and insomnia symptoms (75.89% vs. 70.27%) than those who relied on traditional face-to-face learning (<i>Ps</i> &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for covariates, subjects with PSU were more likely to report depressive symptoms (AdjOR = 3.14, 95% CI = 2.26-4.37), anxiety symptoms (AdjOR = 3.73, 95% CI = 2.13-4.59), and insomnia symptoms (AdjOR = 2.96, 95% CI = 2.23-3.92) than those without PSU. Furthermore, the associations of PSU with depressive symptoms (OR = 4.66 vs. 2.33, <i>P</i> for interaction = 0.015) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 6.05 vs. 2.94, <i>P</i> for interaction = 0.021) were more pronounced in the online learning group. Our study provides preliminary evidence that Chinese university students have serious smartphone addiction problems, which are associated with depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms.

"""Essential One Day and Forgotten the Next"": Perceptions of Ohio's Early Childhood Workforce on Their Exclusion from the Educator Phase of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution","This study explores Ohio Early Childhood and Care (ECEC) workers' perspectives about different prioritization for COVID-19 vaccine distribution between Ohio educators employed in ECEC and prek-12 settings. Days after Ohio's shutdown, ECEC programs began reopening for children of essential workers, and by June 2020 all ECEC programs could reopen with enhanced mitigation strategies, while the prek-12 workforce remained remote as they cautiously returned in-person ranging from 2 to 9Ã‚Â months later. Ohio was 1 of 4 states that, despite contrary Center for Disease Control guidance, excluded ECEC workers from the phase of vaccine distribution in which prek-12 workers were eligible. Data on ECEC employee perceptions of this difference were collected via anonymous online questionnaire from 194 ECEC workers. Qualitative analysis revealed six themes: 1. Participants compared themselves to prek-12, 2. believe they are valuable, 3. disagreed with the decision, 4. felt undervalued compared to prek-12, 5. felt exploited, and 6. suffered mental health effects.

"Depression symptoms and the perception of public health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: The protective effect of sense of control","The psychological impact of public health restrictions may play a role in the increased depression levels reported since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Data further suggest that people's sense of personal control has been reduced during the pandemic also producing psychological distress. This study aimed to test whether perceptions of public health restrictions predict depression under pandemic conditions and if the sense of control can serve as a protective factor. For this cross-sectional study, 641 residents in Saudi Arabia over the age of 17Ã‚Â years were recruited between November and December of 2020 to complete an online survey. The survey assessed depression levels (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), the sense of control and perceptions of public health restrictions. Demographic information was also collected. Depression levels were higher compared to previous samples (<i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.12). The number of restrictions perceived as distressing strongly predicted the probability of high BDI scores, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ²</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.92</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:math> , with higher sense of control predicting lower levels of depression (constraints, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ²</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.50</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:math> , mastery, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ²</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.71</mml:mn></mml:mrow> </mml:math> ). A strong sense of control significantly reduced the impact of the perception of restrictions on depression. These results suggest that the perception of public health restrictions is part of the reason for increased levels of depression during the pandemic. A strong sense control reduced the impact of restrictions on depression. It is therefore possible that simple interventions enhancing the sense of control, such as the availability of choice, could support mental health in restricted situations.","Senan, Halbrook, Kornbrot, Msetfi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101836","20220523","COVID-19; Depression; Public health restrictions; Sense of control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31822,""
"Suicidal Behaviours During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Review","Novel COVID-19 disease has become a major concern worldwide, and a recent line of research warned that the context of the COVID-19 pandemic may be a major risk factor for developing severe suicidal behaviors. A broad systematic review is needed to cover the studies that have already assessed the potential underlying factors for suicidal behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, and data were then described according to the subsequent categories: (1) countries where the studies were carried out; (2) factors impacting suicidal behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak; and (3) examination of the observed populations. Findings of the current systematic review suggest that there is a certain amount of heterogeneity in factors impacting suicidal behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak, with economic downturn, psychiatric vulnerability, isolation and quarantine, health concerns, and relational difficulties being the most prominent reasons for developing suicidal behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak. Timely interventions are needed to prevent suicidal behaviors in both the clinical and general populations, and in this regard, the creation of standard procedures may speed up the process.","Barberis, CannavÃƒÂ², Cuzzocrea, Verrastro","https://doi.org/10.36131/cnfioritieditore20220202","20220523","COVID-19; coronavirus; pandemic; suicidal behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31823,""
"Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic in Jazan, Saudi Arabia","The aim of this study was to measure anxiety levels and many co-factors that might influence the levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak in southern Saudi Arabia (KSA). A cross-sectional self-reporting survey was conducted to determine the level of general anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms related to COVID-19 and quarantining. We selected a convenience sample of eligible participants who had been invited online through social media apps. The survey instrument was distributed, and 981 participants responded. Of the total sample, almost 90% were under the age of 40, 75% were women, and 77% had an educational level beyond high school. Just over half were single, with nearly all participants Saudi nationals. The overall prevalence of anxiety related to COVID-19 was 27%.

"Mental state, biological rhythm and social support among healthcare workers during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan","The COVID-19 pandemic has put the mental health of healthcare workers at risk. However, the potential psychosocial factors underlying mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, require further investigation. The present study aimed to explore the factors that influence the mental state of healthcare workers. A total of 276 healthcare workers completed a set of online self-report questionnaires from February 2 to 5, 2020, in the following order: general information related to the COVID-19 outbreak, Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Social Support Rating Scale. Our study revealed that both social support and age moderated the ability of biological rhythm disturbance to exacerbate depression (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.47; effect size f<sup>2</sup> = 0.85). Higher levels of social support buffered the amplification of depression associated with increased biological rhythm disturbance in all age groups, and especially in younger individuals (mean age = 26.57, <i>se</i> = 0.04). Depressive symptoms were predicted by both social and sleeping rhythms, whereas anxiety symptoms were predicted only by social rhythm. Married individuals had lower biological rhythm disturbance ratings and higher social support ratings. Females also reported higher ratings in social support. Our study suggests that biological rhythm intervention along with social support can reduce the negative effect of biological rhythm disturbance on mood disorders, especially in younger people. We also provide evidence for the ability of social support to buffer stress in a major health crisis and demonstrate the effects of marital status and sex, which provide a different perspective for studying mental crisis management.","Liu, Li, Jiang, Liu, Xue, Yu, Wei, Meng, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09439","20220523","Biological rhythm; COVID-19; Healthcare worker; Social support; Stress buffering effect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31825,""
"Perceived academic satisfaction level, psychological stress and academic risk among Indian students amidst COVID-19 pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic has a significant impact on education and mental health outcomes. This study attempts to analyze the factors associated with academic satisfaction level, psychological stress/anxiety, and future academic risk among Indian students of higher education in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted through a structured questionnaire among students of higher education. Multivariate ordered logistic regression models were performed to find out the predictors of perceived academic satisfaction level, psychological stress, and academic risk among the participants. Among the 630 participants, the majority of the students (73%) had low to moderate levels of academic satisfaction. Over two-thirds of participants (68%) had a high level of stress and nearly two-fifths (38%) of the participants felt very high risk in their academic career. The multivariate logistic regression models show that the likelihood of psychological stress and academic risk was significantly higher among students aged above 25 years, researchers, and those who belong to broken families. Besides, the higher probability of satisfaction level is associated with female students, undergraduates, belonging to economically well-off families, and rural residents. Our study suggests that the Covid-19 pandemic leads to a range of psychological health problems. Therefore, increase students' satisfaction with online classes and it is essential to preserve the mental health of individuals and to develop psychological interventions that can improve the mental health of students during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Kapasia, Paul, Roy, Das, Ghosh, Chouhan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09440","20220523","Academic risk; Academic satisfaction; Higher education; Mental health; Psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31826,""
"The effect of cyberchondria on anxiety, depression and quality of life during COVID-19: the mediational role of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and Internet addiction","Since the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), online health information-seeking behaviors have notably increased. Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for the worsening of anxiety-depressive symptoms and quality of life. The current study aims to understand the predictive effect of cyberchondria on health anxiety, anxiety, depression and quality of life considering the mediating effect of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and Internet addiction and the moderating effect of COVID anxiety. 572 Italian participants (66% female; Mean age = 34; SD = 15) took part in a cross-sectional online survey involving CSS-12, MOCQ-R, IAT, SHAI, HADS, WHOQoL-BREF and CAS. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and Internet addiction were found to partially mediate the cyberchondria-health anxiety and the cyberchondria-anxiety links and to totally mediate the cyberchondria-depression and the cyberchondria-quality of life links. COVID anxiety was found to moderate the relationship between cyberchondria and anxiety. The findings suggest that compulsivity may have a key role in the explanation of the underlying mechanisms of cyberchondria. Healthcare practitioners should provide additional support for individuals with cyberchondria. As such, cyberchondria is a contributing factor to the exacerbation of anxiety-depressive disorders and may impact on the quality of life.","Ambrosini, Truzoli, Vismara, Vitella, Biolcati","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09437","20220523","Anxiety; Compulsivity; Cyberchondria; Depression; Internet addiction; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31827,""
"Determinants of anxiety and depression among Bangladeshi adults during COVID-19 lockdown: An online survey","Human health and well-being are adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19. This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression during COVID-19 lockdown in Bangladesh, and their association with some less explored factors like perceived and relative health status, having elderly members in the family, fear for own and family future, and others from the Asian context. Using an online survey, data were collected from the population aged 18 years and above, on socio-demographic and economic attributes, and two separate standardized twelve-item scales were used to assess the level of anxiety and depression. Both descriptive and multivariate linear regression were used to analyze the factors associated with anxiety and depression scores. The respondents had an average anxiety score of 21.74 (SD = 8.20) on a scale ranging from 12 to 60 and an average depression score of 24.39 (SD = 10.30) on the same scale. The study findings revealed that respondents' concern for future well-being, perceived physical health status compared to others in the same cohort, and perceived physical health status during the survey compared to prior COVID-19 were significantly associated with anxiety and depression scores during COVID-19 lockdown. In addition, the anxiety score was significantly higher (<i>p</i> = 0.046) for women respondents than men. Moreover, respondents aged 18-24 years had significantly higher (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) depression than others. The increased level of anxiety and depression during COVID-19 of adult people in Bangladesh are associated with several factors of which their greater concern about the future of their own and family members and health-related attributes are important. These findings may lead to developing interventions to reduce the psychological crisis during the pandemic in Bangladesh.","Haque, Ul Islam, Hasan, Hossain, Hossain Khan, Islam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09415","20220523","Adults; Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31828,""
"Impact of restrictive COVID-19 measures on daily momentary affect in an epidemiological youth sample in Hong Kong: An experience sampling study","Restrictive COVID-19 measures can have significant mental health impacts, particularly on young people. How such measures may influence day-to-day momentary affect, nonetheless, remains to be explored. Experience sampling data were collected from 165 young people (aged 15-24) as part of a larger epidemiological youth mental health study in Hong Kong. We examined the impact of one of the most stringent COVID-19 measures - dine-in restrictions - on momentary positive and negative affect and current contexts and activities of these young people. The effects of a milder form of COVID-19 measure - school suspension - were separately examined. Multilevel analysis revealed that those in the dine-in ban group, compared to dining-as-usual, showed significantly reduced momentary positive affect (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.17, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.06, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003). Its effect remained significant even when accounting for baseline depressive and anxiety symptoms and socioeconomic status (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.15, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.008). The effect of dine-in ban on reduced momentary positive affect was found specifically when participants were in indoor locations (e.g., home, office), alone, and engaged in passive leisure activities. This pattern was not observed when participants were at school or at other outdoor locations, with friends, or engaged in active leisure activities. No significant effect of school suspension on momentary affect was observed. More severe COVID-19 measures, such as dine-in ban, can have significant impacts on the momentary positive affect of young people. Certain contexts and activities may offer protection against the consequences of COVID-19 measures. The current findings may help to inform future designs of mental health interventions and public health policies.

"COVID-19 outcomes in HIV patients: A review","The effect of COVID-19 is enormous, and high-risk COVID-19 case arises when underlying infections like diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy are present, and an immunocompromised state such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). People living with HIV(PLHIV) may be exposed to severe COVID-19, mostly in areas with poor access to proper care and complex intervention for HIV infection. During the lockdown, those with medical appointments will not access health facilities, which may be detrimental to people living with HIV. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 pandemic fear may lead to adverse mental health outcomes and affect preventive behavior. In addition to the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV, COVID-19 is also causing concerns. People with HIV tend to have mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress (PTSD), which can be both a cause and a harmful impact of HIV. Discussed in this research is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV patients, their similarities, differences, and urgent attention from healthcare centers to take charge and respond to patients with HIV and other immunosuppressed conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Aborode, Olotu, Oyetunde, Ajagbe, Mustapha, Karra-Aly, Oko","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103768","20220523","AIDS; COVID-19; Depression; HIV; Outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31831,""
"Psychosis due to anxiety related to COVID-19: A case report","Limited information is available regarding various effects of lifestyle changes caused by coronavirus pandemic on human life. On the other hand, if the fear of getting infected by coronavirus is accompanied by other psychological crises, it can possibly lead to psychosis in people with or without a previous history of mental illness. The patient is a 36-year-old man with no previous history of mental illness who divorced his wife 6 months before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. The patient developed auditory hallucinations and paranoid thoughts after the outbreak. After diagnosis of psychosis, treatment with injectable haloperidol was started. He was then treated with risperidone for maintenance therapy. On the other hand, for depressive symptoms, the patient was treated with bupropion. One week after starting the treatment, the patient's paranoid thoughts and auditory hallucinations improved. Getting infected with coronavirus or being severely afraid of it may cause symptoms of psychosis in those with a history of previous mental disease. There is also evidence that extreme fear of infection with coronavirus can lead to psychosis if accompanied by other psychological crises. It is necessary to pay more attention to the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety caused by COVID-19. Failure to immediately treat the anxiety caused by the fear of infection in this pandemic or other epidemics can lead to more serious problems such as psychosis and create further risks for the individual, family and community.","Kargar-Soleimanabad, Dehbozorgi, Mahdi Mahdavinoor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103795","20220523","Anxiety; COVID-19; Case report; Fear; Pandemic; Psychos","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31832,""

"Cumulative trauma from multiple natural disasters increases mental health burden on residents of Fort McMurray","Fort McMurray, a city in northern Alberta, Canada, has experienced multiple traumatic events in the last five years, including the 2016 wildfire, the 2020 floods, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Traumatic events often lead to increased mental health burdens in affected communities. To assess if the number of traumatic events experienced by residents of Fort McMurray correlates with the prevalence and severity of mental health issues experienced. A cross-sectional study using an online survey questionnaire was used to gather demographic, trauma (wildfire, flooding, and COVID-19), and clinical information from the resident of Fort McMurray between April 24 to June 2 2021. Likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and low resilience were measured using standardised rating scales. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 26 using Chi-Square tests and multivariate regression analysis. Respondents who experienced COVID-19 and either flood or wildfire traumas (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°101) were eleven times more likely to have GAD symptoms (OR: 11.39; 95% CI: 1.43-91.04), four times more likely to have likely MDD, (OR: 3.85; 95% CI: .995-14.90), ten times more likely to have likely PTSD (OR: 10.47; 95% CI: 1.28-85.67), and low resilience (OR: 10.56; 95% CI: 1.21-92.17). Respondents who experienced COVID-19, flooding, and wildfire traumas (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°47) were eighteen times more likely to express GAD symptoms (OR: 18.30; 95% CI: 2.20-152.45) and more than eleven times likely to have likely PTSD (OR: 11.41; 95% CI: 1.34-97.37) in comparison to the respondents who experienced COVID-19 only trauma (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19). Measures to reduce climate change and associated natural disasters could reduce the impact of cumulative trauma and associated mental health burden in vulnerable populations. It is essential that more mental health resources are mobilised to support communities impacted by multiple natural disasters. The number of traumatic disasters experienced in residents of Fort McMurray five years after the 2016 wildfires, a year after the 2020 flooding, and during the COVID-19 pandemic correlates with the prevalence and severity of the mental health conditions reported in this study. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Fort McMurray es una ciudad en el norte de Alberta, CanadÃƒÂ¡, que ha experimentado mÃƒÂºltiples eventos traumÃƒÂ¡ticos en los ÃƒÂºltimos cinco aÃƒÂ±os, incluyendo el incendio forestal del 2016, las inundaciones del 2020 y la pandemia por la COVID-19. Los eventos traumÃƒÂ¡ticos con frecuencia conducen a una mayor carga de salud mental en las comunidades afectadas. <b>Objetivo:</b> Evaluar si el nÃƒÂºmero de eventos traumÃƒÂ¡ticos experimentados por los residentes de Fort McMurray se correlacionan con la prevalencia y la severidad de los problemas de salud mental experimentados. <b>MÃƒÂ©todos:</b> Se realizÃƒÂ³ un estudio transversal utilizando un cuestionario en lÃƒÂ­nea para recolectar informaciÃƒÂ³n demogrÃƒÂ¡fica relacionada con el trauma (incendio forestal, inundaciÃƒÂ³n y COVID-19) y con la informaciÃƒÂ³n clÃƒÂ­nica de los residentes de Fort McMurray entre el 24 de abril y el 2 de junio del 2021. Se midiÃƒÂ³ la probabilidad del trastorno de ansiedad generalizada (TAG), del trastorno depresivo mayor (TDM), del trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (TEPT) y de una baja resiliencia utilizando escalas de mediciÃƒÂ³n estandarizadas. Los datos fueron analizados con el programa SPSS versiÃƒÂ³n 26 utilizando las pruebas de Chi cuadrado y el anÃƒÂ¡lisis multivariado de regresiÃƒÂ³n. <b>Resultados:</b> Los encuestados que experimentaron la COVID-19 y los traumas por las inundaciones o los incendios forestales (<i>N</i>=101) tenÃƒÂ­an once veces mÃƒÂ¡s probabilidad de tener sÃƒÂ­ntomas de TAG (OR: 11.39; 95% CI: 1.43Ã¢â‚¬â€œ91.04), cuatro veces mÃƒÂ¡s probabilidad de tener un TDM (OR: 3.85; 95% CI:.995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14.90), diez veces mÃƒÂ¡s probabilidad de tener TEPT (OR: 10.47; 95% CI: 1.28Ã¢â‚¬â€œ85.67) y una baja resiliencia.

"The PSYCARE model: Its efficacy in mental health care during the fourth outbreak of COVID-19 in Vietnam","Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) was seriously affected by the 4<sup>th</sup> COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to provide mental health care services for people through a psychological intervention model, called ""PSYCARE."" The model included five MHC services: active and passive education, propagation, 24-h hotline consultation, online interventions/counseling, and crisis intervention. The entire workflow was implemented in the three steps under the leadership of the Ho Chi Minh City government: (1) Preparation and mobilization, (2) Multidisciplinary team establishment, and (3) Feedback mechanism, and project completion. By statistical method on service usage data of people during the outbreak, we evaluated the results as well as discussed the model's effectiveness. In 42 days of implementation, there were a total of 149 posts, 1660 shares in social networks with more than 4,000 interactions per week. A MHC handbook was published. Ten episodes of MHC radio and ten live TV programs were broadcast with more than 10,000 listening times. We successfully propagated 35 topics at 4 COVID-19 hospitals and 34 quarantine areas. A total of 2,069 hotline consultations were done. 1,382 cases were counseled online, and 145 one-on-one crisis interventions were done to three groups: COVID-19 infected/affected children and adults, vulnerable people, frontline medical, and military staff. The PSYCARE model has been proven to positively affect the general population's mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our framework and model could be used as an expert reference guide in providing effective psychological intervention in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huynh, Giang, Do, Bui, Nguyen, Nguyen","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+PSYCARE+model:+Its+efficacy+in+mental+health+care+during+the+fourth+outbreak+of+COVID-19+in+Vietnam.","20220523","24-h hotline consultation; crisis intervention; mental health care; passive education; propagation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31835,""
"Psychometric Properties of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Items (SAVE-6) Scale for High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, high school students have experienced a sudden change of school environment, which may result in difficulties related to mental health. The aim of this study is to estimate the reliability and validity of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Items (SAVE-6) scale among high school students. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 300 high school students. The following scales were administered: the SAVE-6, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Items (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Items (PHQ-9). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted, and the psychometric properties of the SAVE-6 were assessed. The results of the CFA indicated good model fit for the SAVE-6 scale among high school students (Ãâ€¡2/df = 0.485, CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.010, RMSEA &lt; 0.001, and SRMR = 0.029). In addition, the SAVE-6 scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.844, McDonald's Omega = 0.848, and split-half reliability = 0.883). The appropriate cut-off score for the SAVE-6 scale was estimated as Ã¢â€°Â¥15, which corresponds to a mild level of anxiety as assessed by the GAD-7 (Ã¢â€°Â¥5). The SAVE-6 scale was found to be reliable and valid, and can be used as a tool to assess the stress and anxiety of high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Ahmed, AkÃƒÂ§a, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.815339","20220523","COVID-19; anxiety; epidemics; psychological; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31836,""
"Selected Aspects of the Mental Functioning of Women After Childbirth in a Hospital During a Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is stressful for pregnant women, their families, and their unborn baby. The study aimed to assess the impact of a pandemic on the mental state of women after childbirth. The study included 363 women hospitalized after delivery. The study used a diagnostic survey method using the proprietary questionnaire and the Family Affluence Scale (FAS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS), The Basic Hope Inventory (BHI-12), and General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES). Suspicion of postpartum depression was found in 109 women (mean: 15.28 Ã‚Â± 2.22)-group I, and no suspicion of it in 254 subjects (mean: 6.03 Ã‚Â± 2.63)-group II. Mean values of the sense of loneliness in group I (27.11 Ã‚Â± 6.00) were higher than in group II (21.35 Ã‚Â± 7.02), and the basic hope-BHI-12, in group I-lower (27.92 Ã‚Â± 5.14) than in group II (31.75 Ã‚Â± 4.97). In the Generalized Own Efficacy Scale, the group I obtained lower mean values (28.07 Ã‚Â± 4.86 points and 5.87 Ã‚Â± 1.96 points) than group II (30.97 Ã‚Â± 3.77 points and 6.02 Ã‚Â± 1 points, 38 sten). As much as 30% of the respondents showed a risk of postpartum depression. The most felt was the limitation of family visits during the hospital stay. In addition, the respondents were most concerned about the child's health in both groups. The feeling of loneliness in group I was higher, and basic hope and generalized self-efficacy were lower than in group II. The differences between these relationships were statistically significant.","KuÃ…â€šak-Bejda, Malinowska-GleÃ…â€ž, Bejda, Slifirczyk, Waszkiewicz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.846645","20220523","COVID-19; childbirth; emotions; motherhood; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31837,""
"Neuropsychological manifestations of long COVID in hospitalized and non-hospitalized Brazilian Patients","There has been a significant increase in number of patients seeking neuropsychological rehabilitation months after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. Identify the cognitive and psychiatric disorders in patients with long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) and explore the association between disease severity during the acute phase and persistent neuropsychological manifestations. 614 adults were assessed an average of eight months post-infection. Participants were, on average, 47.6 y.o., who sought rehabilitation for neuropsychological problems. Patients were evaluated using the Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS), Phonemic Verbal Fluency and Clock Drawing tests (NEUPSILIN) for executive functions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The BNIS score was significantly below reference values in all subscales, especially affect and memory. Verbal Fluency and Clock Drawing subtest results were also lower. Patients with PASC tested high for anxiety/depression, but there was no statistically significant relationship between HADS and BNIS scores. Neuropsychological evaluations showed no differences in cognitive or psychiatric profiles between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Neuropsychological results suggest executive function problems and high incidence of anxiety/depression, irrespective of acute-phase severity, underscoring a need for neurorehabilitation programs while providing data for public policy initiatives.","Braga, Oliveira, Moreira, Pereira, Carneiro, Serio, Freitas, Isidro, Souza","https://doi.org/10.3233/NRE-228020","20220523","COVID-19; Coronavirus; anxiety; cognitive dysfunction; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31838,""
"Cognitive, Functional, and Emotional Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Greek Patients with Neurocognitive Disorders","Prolonged periods of social deprivation, such as COVID-19-related lockdowns, are associated with deleterious effects on cognitive functions. The aim of this study was to gauge the effect of prolonged social isolation on the cognitive function of older adults with neurocognitive disorders. We recruited 125 older adults with minor or major neurocognitive disorders divided into two groups. The control group was tested at the first period of the study (October 2018-May 2019), whereas the experimental group was evaluated at the second chronological period of the study (October 2020-May 2021) during the second wave of COVID-19. Neuropsychological tests were performed at baseline and six months after baseline. In the control group, significant changes in the scores from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.049) and the Functional Rating Scale for Symptoms of Dementia (FRSSD; pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.005) were found between baseline and follow-up assessments, whereas no changes were identified in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.229) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.619) scores. In the experimental group, the scores from all neuropsychological tests (MoCA, MMSE, GDS, and FRSSD; pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001 for all) were significantly different at follow-up when compared with those at baseline measurements. Moreover, significant deterioration of specific functions assessed in MMSE and FRSSD was detected, especially in the experimental group. This study highlights cognitive functions directly affected by social deprivation of individuals with neurocognitive disorders. The findings can be used in the rehabilitation from confinement and its negative consequences.","Tsiakiri, Vlotinou, Terzoudi, Heliopoulos, Vadikolias","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-220118","20220523","COVID-19; Cognitive functions; emotional status; neurocognitive disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31839,""
"Symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in six European countries and Australia - Differences by prior mental disorders and migration status","Little is known about changes of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in potentially disadvantaged groups. We investigated changes in anxiety and depression symptoms during the first year of the pandemic in six European countries and Australia by prior mental disorders and migration status. Overall, 4674 adults answered a web-based survey in May-June 2020 and were followed by three repeated surveys up to February 2021. Information on psychosocial, financial and demographic, living conditions, prior mental disorders, depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic and migration status was collected. Weighted general estimation equations modelling was used to investigate the association between prior mental disorders, migration status, and symptoms over time. Most participants were &lt;40Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old (48%), women (78%) and highly educated (62%). The baseline prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms ranged between 19%-45% and 13%-35%, respectively. In most countries, prevalence rates remained unchanged throughout the pandemic and were higher among people with prior mental disorders than without even after adjustment for several factors. We observed interactions between previous mental disorders and symptoms of anxiety or depression over time in two countries. No difference by migration status was noted. Convenience sampling limits generalizability. Self-assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety might involve some misclassification. Depression and anxiety symptoms were worse among individuals with prior mental disorders than without, but there was no clear trend of worsening mental health in the observed groups during the observed period.","GÃƒÂ©mes, BergstrÃƒÂ¶m, Papola, Barbui, Lam, Hall, Seedat, Morina, Quero, Campos, Pinucci, Tarsitani, Deguen, van der Waerden, PatanÃƒÂ¨, Sijbrandij, AcartÃƒÂ¼rk, Burchert, Bryant, Mittendorfer-Rutz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.082","20220522","COVID-19; General population; Longitudinal study; Prior mental disorders; Symptoms of anxiety and depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31840,""
"Seizure control during the COVID-19 pandemic: Correlating Responsive Neurostimulation System data with patient reports","To understand the impact of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on seizure frequency in persons with epilepsy with a Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) system implanted. Weekly long episode counts (LEC) were used as a proxy for seizures for six months pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 period. Telephone surveys and chart reviews were conducted to assess patient mental health during the pandemic. The change in LEC between the two time periods was correlated to reported stressors. Twenty patients were included. Comparing the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, we found that only 5 (25%) patients had increased seizures, which was positively correlated with change in anti-seizure medications (ASM, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03) and bitemporal seizures (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03). Increased seizures were not correlated to anxiety (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.00), depression (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.58), and sleep disturbances (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.00). The correlation between RNS-detected and patient-reported seizures was poor (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.32). Most of our patients did not have an increase in seizures following the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in ASM and bitemporal seizures were positively correlated to increased LEC. There was no correlation between pandemic-related stress and seizures in those found to have increased seizures. This is the first study correlating RNS-derived objective LECs with patient self-reports and potential seizure risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Karakas, Ward, Hegazy, Skrehot, Haneef","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2022.05.003","20220522","COVID-19; Epilepsy; Long episode; Pandemic; RNS; Stressor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31841,""
"The relationship between internet addiction and aggressive behavior among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: Anxiety as a mediator","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges for adolescents, who tended to experience more emotional instability, impulsivity, and aggressive behavior driven by the fear of infection and the uncertainty of network information. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between Internet addiction and aggressive behavior, and the mediating effects of depression and anxiety. There were differences in Internete addiction and aggressive behavior in gender, thus the moderating role of gender between them were explored. A total of 1148 middle school students were invited to complete the Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Internet Addition Scale, the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) separately. The results suggested that 1) there was a significant positive correlation between Internet addiction and aggressive behavior; 2) anxiety, but not depression, mediated the effect of Internet addiction on aggressive behavior; 3) gender did not moderate the effect of Internet addiction on aggressive behavior.

We conducted a longitudinal study of the influence of repeated mild lockdowns during two emergency declarations in Japan, in May 2020 and February 2021. The analyses included 7893 people who participated in all online surveys. During repeated mild lockdowns, mental and physical symptoms decreased overall, while loneliness increased and social networks decreased. Subgroup analyses revealed that depression and suicidal ideation did not decrease only in the younger age group (aged 18-29Ã‚Â years) and that younger and middle-aged people (aged 18-49Ã‚Â years), women, people with a history of treatment for mental illness, and people who were socially disadvantaged in terms of income had higher levels of mental and physical symptoms at all survey times. Additionally, comprehensive extraction of the interaction structure between depression, demographic attributes, and psychosocial variables indicated that loneliness and social networks were most closely associated with depression. These results indicate that repeated lockdowns have cumulative negative effects on social isolation and loneliness and that susceptible populations, such as young people and those with high levels of loneliness, require special consideration during repeated lockdown situations.","Yamamoto, Uchiumi, Suzuki, Sugaya, Murillo-Rodriguez, Machado, Imperatori, Budde","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12420-0","20220523","Adolescent; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Humans; Japan; Loneliness; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Social Isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31843,""

"Adolescentsâ€™ pluralistic ignorance and reasoning about COVID-19 public health behaviors","Pluralistic ignorance (the inaccurate perception that oneâ€™s behavior differs from that of the average individual) can shift behavior towards perceived norms. Such behaviors are also accompanied by social reasoning processes. The present work examined adolescentsâ€™ pluralistic ignorance and reasoning in the COVID-19 context. Participants (n = 130, M age = 16.96, SD = 1.06) demonstrated pluralistic ignorance by reporting that they were more likely to engage in public health behaviors compared to their peers or the average teenager. Participants negatively evaluated guideline breaches and reasoned about harm reduction to justify this, but also recognised the importance of protecting mental health. Together this evidence documents the importance of considering social norms and reasoning in public health contexts to frame communication efforts.","Luke McGuire et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00D8-158-C0B","20220524","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; covid-19; reasoning; adolescents; social norms; public health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31845,""
"The impact of age and psychosocial factors on cognitive and auditory outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives. Hearing loss is the leading potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia. A potential mediator in the relationship between hearing loss and increased dementia risk is the psychosocial pathway, which suggests that increased social isolation and mental health factors associated with hearing loss causes increased dementia risk and exacerbates dementia symptoms. In March 2020, the UK government announced social restriction measures to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, with older adults who were considered clinically vulnerable needing to isolate. This study aimed to determine the impact of psychosocial factors, including loneliness, depression, and engagement in various recreational lifestyle activities, on hearing and cognitive function in younger and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was hypothesised that auditory and cognitive function would be significantly predicted by age, psychosocial factors, and time since the start of the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Additionally, auditory function was hypothesised to be associated with cognitive functioning. Design. Participants included 112 older adults (62 female) aged 60-83 (M = 70.75, SD = 5.88), and 121 younger adults (85 female) aged 18-30 (M = 21.04, SD = 2.75). Participants took part online from June 2020 - February 2021 and completed a series of questionnaires assessing loneliness, depression, auditory and lifestyle engagement, and subjective hearing ability. They also completed a series of behavioural tasks assessing speech perception, short-term and working memory, processing speed, and executive function, providing composite measures of global cognitive functioning and auditory functioning. Results. Multiple regression analyses found that, of the variables examined, age significantly predicted both global cognitive and auditory function, with older adults displaying poorer auditory and cognitive performance. While age was the only significant predictor in the model predicting cognitive performance, in the model predicting auditory function increased depressive symptoms were a significant predicter alongside age. Further, auditory function did not significantly predict cognitive function. Conclusions. These data suggest that that loneliness and socialisation do not contribute to reductions in cognitive or auditory functioning, nor did time since the start of the first UK lockdown. Thus, suggesting that hearing and cognition may not have been adversely affected by social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This provides important implications for understanding whether the relationship between hearing loss and cognitive decline is mediated by the psychosocial pathway. However, the study represents only cross-sectional data collected from a potentially biased sample of higher socio-economic position. Future work should seek to address if these conclusions are also valid in populations with different socio-economic characteristics.","Kate Slade et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E006F-DD6-63B","20220523","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception|Audition; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; cognitive function; social isolation; hearing loss; covid-19; ageing","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-24","",31846,""
