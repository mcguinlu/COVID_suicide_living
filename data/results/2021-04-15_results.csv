"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Mental Illness Symptoms in Spain in the COVID-19 Crisis","Objective: This paper systematically reviews and assesses the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms in the general population, frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), and adult students in Spain during the COVID-19 crisis. Data sources: Articles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv from March 2020 to February 6, 2021. Results: The pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms in 23 studies comprising a total sample of 85,560 was 20% (95% CI: 15% - 25%, I2 = 99.9%), that of depression symptoms in 23 articles with a total sample comprising of 86,469 individuals was 23% (95% CI: 18% - 28%, I2 = 99.8%), and that of insomnia symptoms in 4 articles with a total sample of 915 were 52% (95% CI: 42-64%, I2 = 88.9%). The overall prevalence of mental illness symptoms in frontline HCWs, general population, and students in Spain are 42%, 19%, and 50%, respectively. Discussion: The accumulative evidence from the meta-analysis reveals that adults in Spain suffered higher prevalence rates of mental illness symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis with a significantly higher rate relative to other countries such as China. Our synthesis reveals high heterogeneity, varying prevalence rates and a relative lack of studies in frontline and general HCWs in Spain, calling future research and interventions to pay attention to those gaps to help inform evidence-based mental health policymaking and practice in Spain during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. The high prevalence rates call for preventative and prioritization measures of the mental illness symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Richard Z Chen; Stephen X.

"You're just there, alone in your room with your thoughts: A qualitative study about the impact of lockdown among young people during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Adolescents and young adults have been greatly affected by quarantine measures during the coronavirus-19 pandemic. Quantitative evidence has shown that many young people have struggled with their mental health, but little is understood about the qualitative impact of social distancing restrictions on mental health, wellbeing and social lives. We therefore sought to elicit the views and experiences of adolescents and young adults living in the UK during the pandemic. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with 37 participants aged 13-24. Results We identified 4 superordinate themes most commonly described by participants about their experiences during the pandemic, including: a) missing social contact during lockdown, b) disruption to education, c) changes to social relationships, and d) improved wellbeing during lockdown. Although we identified some positive experiences during the pandemic, including an increased awareness of mental health and stronger relationship ties, many said they struggled with loneliness, a decline in mental health, and anxiety about socialising after the pandemic. Conclusions Findings suggest that some young people may have felt less stigma talking about their mental health now compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many are worried about how the pandemic has affected their education and social connections and may require additional psychological, practical and social support. Our findings highlight the important role that education providers play in providing a source of information and support to adolescents and young adults during times of uncertainty.","Alison Ruth McKinlay; Tom May; Joanna Dawes; Daisy Fancourt; Alexandra Burton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.11.21254776","20210414","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12901,""
"COVID-19 impact on anxiety and depression in head and neck cancer patients: a cross-sectional study","To evaluate whether the coronavirus disease 2019 has increased anxiety, depression, and distress levels in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). In this cross-sectional study, RT-HNC patients were surveyed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression and the Distress Thermometer (DT) for distress. HADS scores were compared with data pre-COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the COVID-19 impact on daily routines, treatment, and cancer care through a questionnaire. Fifty patients were included. The HADS mean score and estimated rates were 4.34 (Ã‚Â± 4.06)/ 22% for anxiety; 5.08 (Ã‚Â± 4.82)/ 22% for depression; in comparison, our historical control had 4.04 (Ã‚Â± 3.59)/ 20% for anxiety (p=0.79); and 4.03 (Ã‚Â± 3.62)/ 17% for depression (p=0.49). Mean DT score was 3.68 (Ã‚Â± 2.77). Responders were aware of COVID-19, afraid of having medical complications, believed it was life-threatening, did not miss appointments, believed their treatment was not impacted, and felt safe at the hospital amid the pandemic. This study suggests that anxiety, depression, and distress levels found in RT-HNC patients did not increase during the pandemic. Patients were afraid of being infected by COVID-19; however, they complied with their cancer treatment.","Rodrigues-Oliveira, Kauark-Fontes, Alves, Tonaki, Gueiros, Moutinho, Marta, Barros, Santos-Silva, BrandÃƒÂ£o, Prado-Ribeiro","https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.13876","20210414","Anxiety; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Depression; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Radiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12902,""
"Antimonium Tartaricum as a Possible Homeopathic Prophylactic Remedy in the COVID-19 Epidemic","The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) epidemic has proved challenging due to its high impact on physical and mental health. According to Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, in an epidemic the most severe symptoms of the clinical condition presented by the population in question should be the basis for selecting the medication that is as similar as possible to them, and which should be administered to individuals who have been exposed to the disease but have not yet developed it. This medicine is called the genus epidemicus. This study aims to demonstrate the reasoning used to propose the homeopathic medicine <i>Antimonium tartaricum</i> (<i>Ant-t</i>) as a genus epidemicus in the COVID-19 epidemic. It was decided to develop the reasoning based on the respiratory symptoms described in the epidemiological bulletins presented by the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, as these symptoms are the most serious of the disease. After repertorization, it was confirmed in the <i>Materia Medica</i> that <i>Ant-t</i> has a high degree of similarity with these respiratory symptoms, including the most serious situations, of COVID-19. Homeopathic <i>Ant-t</i> is thus a possible prophylactic genus epidemicus in the COVID-19 epidemic; further studies are needed to test this conclusion.","Fujino, Olandim, Lemonica, Coggan, Takeyama, Sant'Ana, CervezÃƒÂ£o, Benites, Mollo, BarnabÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1725060","20210414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12903,""
"Investigation and Analysis of Perceived Stress Levels in Pediatric Nurses During the 2019-20 SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak","This study investigated perceived stress levels of pediatric nurses during the 2019-20 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak. From February 9 to 13, 2020, 250 pediatric nurses were selected from 4 grade III children's hospitals and 5 grade III general hospitals in Jiangsu Province, China. A general information questionnaire and a stress perception scale were used to investigate and analyze the influencing factors of perceived stress among participants. Perceived stress was at the intermediate level or above for 54.1% (133) of the sample. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that hospital department, living styles, physical conditions, and the proportion of negative (eg, increased deaths and infections) information received about the epidemic (eg, via media and/or face-to-face) influenced perceived stress. Thus, the overall level of perceived stress among clinical pediatric nurses was medium. Nursing managers should pay more attention to and conduct timely assessment interventions for staff to reduce stress levels and promote physical and mental health.","Yan, Xie, Cheng, Zhou, Tian, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1097/HNP.0000000000000445","20210414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12904,""
"COVID-19 and children's health in the United States: consideration of physical and social environments during the pandemic","Public health measures necessary to counteract the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have resulted in dramatic changes in the physical and social environments within which children grow and develop. As our understanding of the pathways for viral exposure and associated health outcomes in children evolves, it is critical to consider how changes in the social, cultural, economic, and physical environments resulting from the pandemic could affect the development of children. This review article considers the environments and settings that create the backdrop for children's health in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, including current threats to child development that stem from: A) change in exposures to environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, disinfectants, air pollution and the built environment; B) changes in food environments resulting from adverse economic repercussion of the pandemic and limited reach of existing safety nets; C) limited access to children's educational and developmental resources; D) changes in the social environments at the individual and household levels, and their interplay with family stressors and mental health; E) social injustice and racism. The environmental changes due to COVID-19 are overlaid onto existing environmental and social disparities. This results in disproportionate effects among children in low-income settings and among populations experiencing the effects of structural racism. This article draws attention to many environments that should be considered in current and future policy responses to protect children's health amid pandemics.","Suarez-Lopez, Cairns, Sripada, Quiros-Alcala, Mielke, Eskenazi, Etzel, Kordas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111160","20210414","COVID-19; Children; Environment; Physical; SARS-CoV-2; Social","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12905,""
"Mental health interventions following COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections: a systematic review of current recommendations and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","To review the most common mental health strategies aimed at alleviating and/or preventing mental health problems in individuals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other coronavirus pandemics. We conducted a systematic review of the literature assessing three databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO). A meta-analysis was performed with data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For non-RCT studies, a critical description of recommendations was performed. From a total of 2,825 articles, 125 were included. Of those, three RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that the interventions promoted better overall mental health outcomes as compared to control groups (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.87 [95%CI 0.33-1.41], p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 69.2%), but did not specifically improve anxiety (SMD = 0.98 [95%CI -0.17 to 2.13], p &gt; 0.05; I2 = 36.8%). Concerning the systematic review, we found a large body of scientific literature proposing recommendations involving psychological/psychiatric interventions, self-care, education, governmental programs, and the use of technology and media. We found a large body of expert recommendations that may help health practitioners, institutional and governmental leaders, and the general population cope with mental health issues during a pandemic or a crisis period. However, most articles had a low level of evidence, stressing the need for more studies with better design (especially RCTs) investigating potential mental health interventions during COVID-19.

"Factors associated with stress, anxiety, and depression during social distancing in Brazil","To estimate the prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms of severe/extreme stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as their associated factors, among Brazilians during social distancing. This is a cross-sectional study conducted in April/May 2020 with 3,200 Brazilians over 18 years old. Respondents' sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using an online questionnaire, which also included the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess emotional symptoms. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. Our results show the prevalence of severe/extreme stress was 21.5%, anxiety 19.4%, and depression 21.5%. In the final model, sociodemographic, clinical, and Covid-19-related factors were associated with severe/extreme stress, anxiety, and depression in Brazilians during social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We found the main factors associated with severe/extreme depression to be young women, brown, single, not religious, sedentary, presenting reduced leisure activities, history of anxiety and depression, increased medication use, and Covid-19 symptoms. This study may help develop and systematically plan measures aimed to prevent, early identify, and properly manage clinical signs and symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Souza, Souza, Souza, Cordeiro, Praciano, Alves, Santos, Silva Junior, Souza","https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2021055003152","20210414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12907,""

"Factors associated with increased cigarette consumption in the Brazilian population during the COVID-19 pandemic","Social distancing measures adopted in various countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to unwanted effects on their populations' health and behaviors. This study aimed to investigate smoking behavior in the Brazilian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze factors associated with the increase in cigarette consumption. An online survey was performed, and the final sample included 45,160 individuals. The study used post-stratification weights and calculated crude prevalence ratios (PR) and adjusted by sex, age, and schooling, and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to analyze associations between increased cigarette consumption and sociodemographic variables and adherence to social distancing, quality of sleep, state of mind, and changes in work and earnings. Prevalence of smokers was 12% (95%CI: 11.1-12.9), 34% of whom reported an increase in cigarette consumption. The increase was greater among women (PR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.01-1.59) and individuals with incomplete secondary schooling (PR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.79). The increase in cigarette consumption was associated with worse quality of sleep, feeling isolated from family members or sad, depressed, or anxious, loss of earnings, and worse self-rated health. Health promotion strategies, smoking prevention, and encouragement for smoking cessation, as well as mental health interventions, should be continued and reinforced in the context of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medidas de distanciamento social adotadas em diversos paÃƒÂ­ses para mitigar o impacto da pandemia de COVID-19 podem acarretar efeitos indesejÃƒÂ¡veis sobre a saÃƒÂºde e o comportamento das populaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes. Este estudo objetivou investigar o comportamento de fumar na populaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o adulta brasileira durante a pandemia de COVID-19 e analisar os fatores associados ao aumento do consumo de cigarro. Foi realizado um inquÃƒÂ©rito virtual e a amostra final correspondeu a 45.160 indivÃƒÂ­duos.

"Effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants on vaccine efficacy and response strategies","As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread, several variants have emerged. Variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have attracted significant attention owing to their widespread transmission and possible immune evasion. A total of 19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on original strains have entered clinical studies, including nine vaccines that have obtained emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations. However, newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy. Decreased efficacy of the Novartis, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines against B.1.351 has been reported. The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic via vaccination. Several response strategies, including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines, increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses, and accelerating next-generation vaccines against variants, have been suggested. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against variants and response strategies for emerging variants. Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for emergency use or under clinical trials have shown certain advantages in providing adequate protection against new variants.

"Psychological and coping strategies of home isolation and social distancing parameters in children and adolescents during COVID 19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It rapidly spread due to strong evidence of human-to-human transmission, resulting in a pandemic throughout the world. Almost all countries around the world, including Qatar, have established guidelines and regulations to limit the spread of the virus and to preserve the health of societies. Unfortunately, these procedures were often associated with some negative effects on individuals' psychological and intellectual well-being, including children and adolescents. The objective of this study was to screen the psychological influence of home isolation and social distancing on children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic, and the strategies used to cope with it. This was a cross-sectional study that was undertaken using an online questionnaire administered through SMS. All home-isolated children and adolescents registered in Primary Health Care Corporation aged 7-18 years old were invited to participate in the study. Children and adolescents with intellectual disadvantages were excluded. A P value .05 (two tailed) was considered statistically significant. Data were collected from 6608 participants through the period of June 23rd to July 18th, 2020. Almost all the participants followed the official regulations during the period of home isolation and social distancing, however 69.1% of parents expressed their children or adolescents were vulnerable to the virus compared to 25% who expressed they were not vulnerable at all. Higher levels of anger, depression and general anxiety were prevalent amongst 1.3%, 3.9% and 1.6% of participants respectively. The mean score of the emotional constructs anger and depression decreased with the increase of following official instructions, with P value of .04 and .11 respectively. The difference in mean score of all psychological and coping strategies used among participants across the three levels of vulnerability to coronavirus, were statistically significant. The mean score trend varied little with the escalation of the level of vulnerability to the virus. This mild variation can make a difference when sample size is large as in case of this study. Screening for psychological and social disruptions is of importance to develop strategies by schools and healthcare providers to assess and monitor behavioral changes and negative psychologically during reintegration post-COVID-19. Participants experiencing higher levels of anxieties should be given extra attention during reintegration and transitional phases in schools. Although electronic devices and social media platforms may have lowered the level of anxiety in some cases, it is important to address how electronic devices and social media platforms are used and how content is tailored for children and adolescents. It is also important to maintain an active lifestyle for children and young adults, and encourage them not to neglect their physical health, as it promotes better psychological state of mind.","Zainel, Qotba, Al-Maadeed, Al-Kohji, Al Mujalli, Ali, Al Mannai, Aladab, AlSaadi, AlKarbi, Al-Baghdadi","https://doi.org/10.2196/24760","20210414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12914,""

Major barriers to help-seeking behaviors are the refusal to seek treatment due to fear of incurring negative views from supervising faculty, time constraints, and the cost of counseling services. Those who do use telemental health resources have positive views and believe that it is an effective tool. Medical students are willing to use telepsychiatry for their personal mental health needs and recognize its value as a treatment modality that will be useful for their future patients. The telemedicine field is evolving but many medical school curriculums do not include education on telemedicine.","Lavergne, Kennedy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01248-6","20210414","Medical students; Mental health; Telemedicine; Telemental health; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12915,""
"The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) Program: An infrastructure for Advancing Population Health Sciences","The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) was established in 2008 by the University of Wisconsin (UW) School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) with the goals of 1) providing a timely and accurate picture of the health of the state residents; and 2) serving as an agile resource infrastructure for ancillary studies. Today SHOW continues to serve as a vital population health research infrastructure. SHOW currently includes 5,846 adult and 980 minor participants recruited between 2008-2019 in four primary waves. WAVE I (2008-2013) includes annual statewide representative samples of 3,380 adults ages 21 to 74 years. WAVE II (2014-2016) is a triannual statewide sample of 1957 adults (age Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) and 645 children. WAVE III (2017) consists of follow-up of 725 adults from the WAVE I and baseline surveys of 222 children in selected households. WAVEs II and III include stool samples collected as part of an ancillary study in a subset of 784 individuals. WAVE IV consist of 517 adults and 113 children recruited from traditionally under-represented populations in biomedical research including African Americans and Hispanics in Milwaukee county, WI. The SHOW provides extensive data to examine the intersectionality of multiple social determinants and population health. SHOW includes a large biorepository and extensive health data collected in a geographically diverse urban and rural population. Over 60 studies have been published covering a broad range of topics including, urban and rural disparities in cardio-metabolic disease and cancer, objective physical activity, sleep, green-space and mental health, transcriptomics, the gut microbiome, antibiotic resistance, air pollution, concentrated animal feeding operations and heavy metal exposures. The SHOW cohort is available for continued longitudinal follow-up and ancillary studies including genetic, multi-omic and translational environmental health, aging, microbiome and COVID-19 research. <b>Strengths and limitations:</b> The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) is an infrastructure to advance population health sciences including biological sample collection and broader data on individual and neighborhood social and environmental determinants of health.The extensive data from diverse urban and rural populations offers a unique study sample to compare how socio-economic gradients shape health outcomes in different contexts.The objective health data supports novel interdisciplinary research initiatives and is especially suited for research in causes and consequences of environmental exposures (physical, chemical, social) across the life course on cardiometabolic health, immunity, and aging related conditions.The extensive biorepository supports novel omics research into common biological mechanisms underlying numerous complex chronic conditions including inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolomics, and epigenetic modulation.Ancillary studies, such as the Wisconsin Microbiome Study, have expanded the utility of the study to examine human susceptibility to environmental exposures and opportunities for investigations of the role of microbiome in health and disease.Long-standing partnerships and recent participation among traditionally under-represented populations in biomedical research offer numerous opportunities to support community-driven health equity work.No biological samples were collected among children.The statewide sampling frame may limit generalizability to other regions in the United States.","Malecki, Nikodemova, Schultz, LeCaire, Bersch, Cadmus-Bertram, Engelman, Hagen, Palta, Sethi, Walsh, Nieto, Peppard","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.15.21253478","20210414","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12916,""
"Examination of Community Sentiment Dynamics due to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study from a State in Australia","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented impacts to people's daily life around the world. Various measures and policies such as lockdown and social-distancing are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses onÃ‚Â the country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at different LGAs in NSW in 5 months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lockdown, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.","Zhou, Yang, Xiao, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00596-7","20210414","COVID-19; Community sentiment; Twitter; Visual analytics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12917,""
"Development of a Brief Group CBT Intervention to Reduce COVID-19-Related Distress Among School-Age Youth","School-aged youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the pandemic will likely have long-standing effects on the well-being of youth, and access to mental health care is even more critical during this time. For the past 5 years, TRAILS (<i>Transforming Research into Action to Improve the Lives of Students)</i> has been working throughout the state to increase utilization of evidence-based mental health practices among K-12 school mental health professionals (SMHPs). By leveraging SMHPs who are widely accessible to students, TRAILS seeks to improve youth access to effective mental health care and reduce current mental health inequities. In March 2020, TRAILS responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a group manual designed to be delivered virtually by SMHPs to help students develop effective coping skills to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. TRAILS focuses on promoting use of CBT and mindfulness, as these skills are ideally suited for school-based delivery, and thus the new manual, <i>Coping with COVID-19</i> (CC-19), was grounded in these modalities. This article will describe the design, development, and deployment of the CC-19 program to address the mental health needs of students in the context of the pandemic. Early acceptability and penetration data will also be discussed.","Rodriguez-Quintana, Meyer, Bilek, Flumenbaum, Miner, Scoville, Warner, Koschmann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.03.002","20210414","CBT; COVID-19; implementation; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12918,""

"How to manage quarantine-adherence, psychosocial consequences, coping strategies and lifestyle of patients with COVID-19 and their confirmed contacts: study protocol of the CoCo-Fakt surveillance study, Cologne, Germany","The current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has placed unprecedented restrictions on people's lives and routines. To counteract the exponential spread of this virus, a lockdown was implemented in Germany in March 2020. Infected persons and their contacts were also quarantined. Compliance with quarantine measures is essential for containing the spread of the virus and avoiding incalculable consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, prolonged homestays, particularly quarantining, may lead to fear, panic, anxiety and depression. Hence, determining the psychological response in people during quarantine and their coping strategies is relevant for the counselling and support of affected persons by healthcare workers. The CoCo-Fakt-Survey (Cologne-Corona-Beratung und UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzung FÃƒÂ¼r Index- und KontAKt-Personen wÃƒÂ¤hrend der QuarantÃƒÂ¤ne-ZeiT; Cologne-Corona counselling and support for index and contacts during the quarantine period-author's translation) will examine a cohort of persons in Cologne quarantined since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak during March 2020. The questionnaire will include demographic data, transmission route, health status, knowledge of and adherence to quarantine measurements, psychological impact on individuals and their family members including children, mental health status, and lifestyle (physical activity/sedentary behaviour, relaxation techniques, nutrition, smoking). All Cologne residents who needed to be quarantined due to a coronavirus infection and the individuals with whom they had contact will be surveyed. No risks have been identified and no complications are expected. Ethics approval was obtained from the Rheinisch-WestfÃƒÂ¤lische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen Human Ethics Research Committee (351/20), and the research will be conducted in accordance with the approved protocol.

"Prevalence and factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress among healthcare workers of Trinidad and Tobago during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","To determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress among healthcare workers (HCWs) during COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional online survey. HCWs from four major hospitals within the Regional Health Authorities of Trinidad and Tobago. 395 HCWs aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years. Depression, anxiety and stress scores. Among the 395 HCWs, 42.28%, 56.2% and 17.97% were found to have depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. In the final stepwise regression model, contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19, p&lt;0.001 (95% CI 3.072 to 6.781) was reported as significant predictors of depression. Further, gender, p&lt;0.001 (95% CI 2.152 to 5.427) and marital status, p&lt;0.001 (95% CI 1.322 to 4.270) of the HCWs were considered to be correlated with anxiety. HCWs who had contact with patients with suspected COVID-19 had lower depression, p&lt;0.001 (95% CI -5.233 to -1.692) and stress, p&lt;0.001 (95% CI -5.364 to -1.591). This study has depicted the prevalence and evidence of depression, anxiety and stress among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on training and mental health of residents: a cross-sectional study","Residency programs have been impacted by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study we aim to investigate and evaluate the impact of the pandemic on residents as well as residency training programs. This was a cross-sectional study including a survey of 43 questions prepared on Google forms and electronically distributed among a convenience sample of residents training at a tertiary center in North Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in the period between October 30th and November 8th of 2020. The survey included questions that addressed the impact of the pandemic on residents' health as well as training programs. The study participants included residents in training at KAUH in 2020 and were stratified according to the type of residency program (surgical residents (SRs) and non-surgical residents (NSRs)). Statistical methods included descriptive analysis, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, Mann Whitney U test, and Cramer's V and r statistics as measures of effect sizes. Of all 430 residents, 255 (59%) responded to the survey. A total of 17 (7%) of residents reported being infected with COVID-19 and a significant difference was reported between SRs and NSRs (10% vs 4%, VÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.124 &quot;small effect&quot; (95% CI; .017-.229), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.048). Approximately, 106 (42%) reported a decrease in the number of staff working at the clinic and 164 (64%) reported limited access to personal protective equipment during the pandemic. On a 4-point Likert scale for the feeling of anxiety, the median was 2 (2-3 IQR) in the NSRs group, vs 2 (1-2 IQR) in the SRs groups, with the NSRs being more likely to feel anxious (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13 &quot;small effect&quot; (95% CI; 0.007-0.249), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.044). Similarly, the proportion of residents who reported feeling anxious about an inadequacy of protective equipment in the work area was significantly greater in the NSRs group (90.3% vs 75.2%; VÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.201 &quot;small effect&quot; (95% CI; .078-.313), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), as well as the proportion of residents who reported feeling increased stress and anxiety between colleagues being also significantly higher in the NSRs group (88.1% vs 76%; VÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.158 &quot;small effect&quot; (95% CI; .032-.279), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.012). The burden of the ongoing pandemic on the mental health status of residents is very alarming and so providing residents with psychological counseling and support is needed. Also, critical implications on the flow of residency training programs have been noticed. This necessitates adapting and adopting smart educational techniques to compensate for such limitations.","Alshdaifat, Sindiani, Khasawneh, Abu-Azzam, Qarqash, Abushukair, Obeidat","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02655-2","20210414","COVID-19; Mental health; Residency; Training program","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12923,""
"Effects of COVID-19 on career and specialty choices among Chinese medical students","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to medical education systems and medical students. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on medical career and specialty choices among medical students. An online cross-sectional survey of Chinese medical students was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from February to April 2020. The students' willingness to be a doctor before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and changed willingness to specialize in respiratory medicine and infectious diseases were investigated. Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression was used to explore factors that were associated with changes of willingness. A total of 1,837 medical students, including 1,227 females (66.8%), with a median age of 21.0Ã‚Â years, were recruited. Of the participants, 10.6% and 6.9% showed increased and decreased willingness to be a doctor after the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Moreover, 11.7% showed increased willingness and 9.5% showed decreased willingness to major in respiratory medicine and infectious diseases. Students with younger age, lower household income, fewer depressive symptoms, less exposure to negative pandemic information and more satisfaction with their own major after the pandemic were associated with increased willingness to be a doctor. Students who engaged in regular exercise, were males and undergraduate level, were interested in medicine, paid more attention to positive information, were satisfied with their majors, and had increased willingness to be a doctor after the pandemic were more likely to choose to specialize in respiratory medicine and infectious disease. However, the severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with decreased willingness to work in the specialties of respiratory medicine and infectious diseases. Psychological problems and professional satisfaction appear to be independent factors that affect medial career and specialty choices. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students require further research.","Deng, Que, Wu, Zhang, Liu, Chen, Wu, Gong, Sun, Yuan, Bao, Ran, Shi, Wing, Shi, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2021.1913785","20210414","COVID-19; career choice; medical students; psychological problems; specialty choice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12924,""
"A health crisis within a health crisis: Opioid access in the COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus has thrown large sections of our healthcare system into disarray, with providers overburdened by record breaking number of hospitalizations and deaths. The U.S., in particular, has remained the nation with one of the fastest growing case counts in the world. As a consequence, many other critical healthcare needs have not received the necessary resources or consideration. This commentary draws attention to substance use and opioid access during the ongoing crisis, given the potential for breakdowns in treatment access for addiction, the growing concern of mental health comorbidities, and the lack of access for those who require opioids for adequate pain management. Further, the commentary will offer policy and practice recommendations that may be implemented to provide more equitable distribution of care.","Narayan, Balkrishnan","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2021.1900981","20210414","COVID-19; Opioid; buprenorphine; coronavirus; methadone; opiate substitution treatment; pain management; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12925,""
"The Korean Version of Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Psychometric Validation in the Korean Population","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has psychological effects such as anxiety and depression as well as direct infection in people. The Fear of COVID-19 scale is a scale that can measure anxiety related to COVID-19 in a short time. The purpose of this study was to verify the reliability and validity the Korean version of Fear of COVID-19 scale (KF-COVID-19S). The data of total 186 normal adults and 17 patients were finally used for the statistical analysis. For internal consistency, Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± was calculated. For concurrent and discriminant validity, the correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment Instrument Brief Form (WHOQOLBREF) were analyzed. For construct validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted. Cronbach alpha was 0.88. The two-factor model (factor 1: Physical fear, factor 2: Emotional fear) showed significantly positive correlations and appeared to be &quot;good&quot; fitness (CFI=0.906, IFI=0.907, NFI=0.902). The KF-COVID-19S can be a useful scale that can measure the physical and emotional fears associated with COVID-19 in a short time. Because the psychiatric patients are a more vulnerable group to the fear, it is thought that the KF-COVID-19S will help to determine the patient's level of anxiety and make a therapeutic plan for the underlying mental disorder.","Hwang, Choi, Yang, Hong, Lee, Park, Jang, Lee","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2020.0420","20210414","Anxiety; COVID-19; COVID-19 fear; Coronavirus; Fear","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12926,""
"Hospitality workersâ€™ COVID-19 risk perception and depression: A contingent model based on transactional theory of stress model","The hospitality industry worldwide is suffering under the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on the transactional theory of stress and coping, this study aims to investigate when hospitality workersâ€™ COVID-19 risk perception affects their likelihood of having depressive symptoms. Using data from 211 hospitality workers in 76 hotels in Peru, we examined the effects of perceived COVID-19 risk on the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms. We posited that this relationship is moderated by the workersâ€™ environment at work (job satisfaction) and at home (the number of children). The results indicate that job satisfaction weakens the link between hospitality workersâ€™ COVID-19 risk perception and their likelihood of depressive symptoms while the number of children exacerbates this link. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on COVID-19 risk perception and offer practical implications for hospitality workers under COVID-19 crisis.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2021.102935","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","",12927,""
