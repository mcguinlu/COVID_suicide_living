"Post-COVID Syndrome A Case Series and Comprehensive Review","The existence of a variety of symptoms with a duration beyond the acute phase of COVID-19, is referred to as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). We aimed to report a series of patients with PCS attending a Post-COVID Unit and offer a comprehensive review on the topic. Adult patients with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were systematically assessed through a semi-structured and validated survey. Total IgG, IgA and IgM serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis were conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to analyze data. Out of a total of 100 consecutive patients, 53 were women, the median of age was 49 years (IQR: 37.8 to 55.3), the median of post-COVID time after the first symptoms was 219 days (IQR: 143 to 258), and 65 patients were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. Musculoskeletal, digestive (i.e., diarrhea) and neurological symptoms including depression (by Zung scale) were the most frequent observed in PCS patients. A previous hospitalization was not associated with PCS manifestation. Arthralgia and diarrhea persisted in more than 40% of PCS patients. The median of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 866.2 U/mL (IQR: 238.2 to 1681). Despite this variability, 98 patients were seropositive. Based on autonomic symptoms (by COMPASS 31) two clusters were obtained with different clinical characteristics. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not different between clusters. A total of 40 articles (11,196 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Fatigue/muscle weakness, dyspnea, pain and discomfort, anxiety/depression and impaired concentration were presented in more than 20% of patients reported. In conclusion, PCS is mainly characterized by musculoskeletal, pulmonary, digestive and neurological involvement including depression. PCS is independent of severity of acute illness and humoral response. Long-term antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and a high inter-individual variability were confirmed. Future studies should evaluate the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may cause PCS and the best therapeutic options.","Juan-Manuel Anaya; Manuel Rojas; Martha L.

"Online-Delivered Group and Personal Exercise Programs to Support Low Active Older Adults' Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, experts in mental health science emphasized the importance of developing and evaluating approaches to support and maintain the mental health of older adults. To assess whether a group-based exercise program relative to a personal exercise program (both delivered online) and wait-list control (WLC) can improve the psychological health of previously low active older adults during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Seniors COvid-19 Pandemic and Exercise (SCOPE) Trial was a 3-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted between May and September 2020 in which low active older adults (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years) were recruited via media outlets and social media. After baseline assessments, consented participants were randomized to one of two 12-week exercise programs (delivered online by older adult instructors) or a waitlist control condition. 241 older adults (n= 187 women) provided baseline measures (via online questionnaires), were randomized (Ngroup = 80, Npersonal = 82 Ncontrol = 79), and completed measures every two weeks for the duration of the trial. The trial's primary outcome was psychological flourishing. Secondary outcomes included global measures of mental and physical health, life satisfaction and depression symptoms. The results of latent growth modeling revealed no intervention effects for flourishing, life satisfaction, or depression symptoms (Ps&gt; .05). Participants in the group condition displayed improved mental health relative to WLC participants over the first 10 weeks (ES = .288 to .601), and although the week 12 effect (ES = .375) was in the same direction the difference was not statistically significant (P &gt;. 05). Participants in the personal condition displayed improved mental health, when compared to WLC participants, in the same medium effect size range (ES = .293 to .565) over the first 8 weeks, and while the effects were of a similar magnitude at weeks 10 (ES = .455) and 12 (ES = .258) they were not statistically significant (P &gt;.05). In addition, participants in the group condition displayed improvements in physical health when compared to the WLC (ES = .079 to .496) across all 12 weeks of the study following baseline. No differences were observed between the personal exercise condition and WLC for physical health (P&gt;.05). There were no intervention effects for the trial's primary outcome, psychological flourishing. It is possible that the high levels of psychological flourishing at baseline may have limited the extent to which those indicators could continue to improve further through intervention (i.e., potential ceiling effects). However, the intervention effects for mental and physical health point to the potential capacity of low-cost and scalable at-home programs to support the mental and physical health of previously inactive adults in the COVID-19 pandemic.

"A long-lasting negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic on public sentiment: a full-year tracking of online public sentiment in mainland China","The outbreak of COVID-19 induces negative emotions among people. These emotions are expressed by humans on social media and rapidly spread through the Internet. The spread could cause a wide range of panic in the public. Understanding the change of online public sentiments during the pandemic provides valuable information for developing appropriate policies to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on the public. Previous studies consistently showed a devastating negative impact of COVID-19 on public sentiments after the outbreak. However, it remains unclear the variation of public sentiment during the recovery phase in the pandemic. In the current study, we continuously tracked online public sentiment through the year 2020 and collected 64,723,242 posts across China's largest social media platform Sina Weibo. We conducted sentiment analysis based on natural language processing to analyze the emotions reflected on posts. We found that the pandemic not only affected online public sentiment in the initial outbreak but also induced long-term negative effects even in the recovery period. The long-term negative effect was no longer correlated with the number of new confirmed cases both locally and nationwide during the recovery period and was not caused by the post-pandemic economic recession. COVID-19 induces long-term negative effects on public sentiments even the country recovers from the pandemic. It reminds public health and government administrators of the need to pay attention to public mental health even once the pandemic has concluded.","Tan, Peng, Zhu, You, Miao, Kuai","https://doi.org/10.2196/29150","20210719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16056,""
"Who is really at risk? The contribution of death anxiety in suicide risk and loneliness among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Isolation and quarantine imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic increased the age-related risk for depression and suicide. However, not all older adults endure the same distress levels. We aimed to identify those at higher risk of depression, perceived loneliness, and suicide, comparing self-reports of depression, loneliness, suicide risk, and death anxiety among 277 participants in three age groups recruited through social media. Older adults reported fewer depression symptoms and lower distress levels but greater suicide risk. Death anxiety was found predictive of depression and suicidality, offering an important criterion for assessing who is really at risk among the non-homogeneous group of older adults.","Aisenberg-Shafran, Bar-Tur, Levi-Belz","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2021.1947416","20210719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16057,""

"Employing telehealth strategies for opioid addiction during COVID-19: implications for social work health care","As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues, more than 40 states have reported increases in opioid-related mortality. The issue of service access and delivery poses a major concern for those struggling with mental illness and substance use disorders in the United States. To ensure the continuity of health care during the pandemic and the co-occurring opioid crisis, the United States continues to adapt its healthcare delivery strategies, which include the introduction of telehealth. Telehealth is a relatively new concept and requires rapid systems changes as well as adjustments from both service providers and recipients. The proper adaptation to the new service delivery method could result in process optimization and improved outcomes for those struggling with opioid dependency. This study aims to bring attention to the opioid crisis that may be overlooked in light of the global pandemic and encourage social workers and other mental health professionals to utilize modern technological advancements to improve service delivery to their clients. This paper offers a literature review with four themes: (1) a retrospect on pain and opioids, (2) current telehealth models and practical strategies, (3) social work roles and functions in telehealth care, and (4) next steps and implications of telehealth for social work as a much-needed health-care delivery tool at the clinical and community social work practice level.","Kim, Tesmer","https://doi.org/10.1080/00981389.2021.1953207","20210719","COVD-19; opioid; social worker roles and functions; substance use disorder; telehealth care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16059,""

"A pre/post analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychosocial work environment and recovery among healthcare workers in a large university hospital in Sweden","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on workload, mental health, and well-being of healthcare workers, and particularly those on the front-line, has received considerable attention. We surveyed hospital employees about their working environment during the pandemic and identified departments which were negatively affected in comparison to the pre-pandemic situation, as well as factors contributing to this. Setting and participants We surveyed all hospital employees at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden in September 2020 and compared results across departments and to the results of a large employee survey from October 2019. The overall impact of the pandemic on perceived working conditions and possibility for recovery differed among departments. During the pandemic, healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients reported poorer working environments than other employees. Factors significantly related to perception of work environment and recovery during the pandemic included worries of being infected, departmental transfer, and having insufficient access to personal protective equipment. Men reported better working conditions than women in all, but one item and higher age was related to better perceived working environment. Our results indicate that the pandemic differentially affects hospital departments and underscores the multifactorial nature of this topic. Contributing factors to poor perceived working environment could be addressed at times of high workload, such as during the pandemic, including providing appropriate support to managers, ensuring possibility for recovery during working hours, and acknowledging worries about infection. Young healthcare workers and staff who are relocated due to the pandemic warrant special attention.","Jonsdottir, Degl'Innocenti, Ahlstrom, Finizia, Wijk, Ãƒâ€¦kerstrÃƒÂ¶m","https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2329","20210719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16061,""
"The effectiveness of teleconsultations in primary care: systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic has focussed attention on models of healthcare that avoid face-to-face contacts between clinicians and patients, and teleconsultations have become the preferred mode of primary care delivery. However, the effectiveness of remote consultations in this setting remains unclear. To evaluate the impact of telephone or video consultations compared to those conducted face-to-face on key patient-relevant outcomes and healthcare utilisation in primary care, mental health and allied health services, which have had a critical role in the management of the wider and longer-term consequences of COVID-19. A systematic review of primary studies comparing telephone or video consultations versus face-to-face visits, following the PRISMA guidelines. Overall, consultations delivered by telephone and videoconference were as effective as face-to-face in-person visits to improve clinical outcomes in adults with mental health conditions and those attending primary care services. Patient satisfaction with telephone and video consultations and the therapeutic alliance was high across the studies. However, high discontinuation rates in patients receiving teleconsultations indicate this may not be a suitable modality of healthcare delivery for all patients. Teleconsultations offer significant patient time savings in primary care, but appropriate implementation, including training of healthcare professionals and management of technical issues, is essential to ensure effective and valuable clinical interventions. Teleconsultations via telephone or videoconference are an effective alternative to face-to-face consultations for many patients attending primary care and mental health services. Teleconsultations have the potential to deliver time-efficient and lower-cost interventions at a distance while improving access to healthcare.","Carrillo de Albornoz, Sia, Harris","https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmab077","20210719","Mental health; primary care; remote consultation; teleconsultation; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16062,""

"COVID-19, Alcohol Consumption and Stockpiling Practises in Midlife Women: Repeat Surveys During Lockdown in Australia and the United Kingdom","<b>Introduction:</b> This project examined the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on alcohol practises (consumption and stockpiling), and perceptions of health risk among women in midlife (those aged 45-64 years). <b>Methods:</b> We collected online survey data from 2,437 midlife women in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia in May 2020, recruited using a commercial panel, in the early days of mandated COVID-19 related restrictions in both countries. Participants were surveyed again (<i>N</i> = 1,377) in July 2020, at a time when COVID-19 restrictions were beginning to ease. The surveys included the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) and questions alcohol stockpiling. Analysis involved a range of univariate and multivariate techniques examining the impact of demographic variables and negative affect on consumption and acquisition outcomes. <b>Results:</b> In both surveys (May and July), UK women scored higher than Australian women on the AUDIT-C, and residence in the UK was found to independently predict stockpiling of alcohol (RR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.91). Developing depression between surveys (RR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.04) and reporting pessimism (RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.81), and fear/anxiety (RR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.70) at the beginning of the study period also predicted stockpiling by the end of the lockdown. Having a tertiary education was protective for alcohol stockpiling at each time point (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.87). <b>Conclusions:</b> COVID-19 was associated with increases in risky alcohol practises that were predicted by negative emotional responses to the pandemic. Anxiety, pessimism and depression predicted stockpiling behaviour in UK and Australian women despite the many demographic and contextual differences between the two cohorts. Given our findings and the findings of others that mental health issues developed or were exacerbated during lockdown and may continue long after that time, urgent action is required to address a potential future pandemic of alcohol-related harms.","Miller, Olver, Wilson, Lunnay, Meyer, Foley, Thomas, Toson, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.642950","20210720","COVID-19; alcohol; health perception; midlife women; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16064,""
"Unraveling the Mystery Surrounding Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19","More than one year since its emergence, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still looming large with a paucity of treatment options. To add to this burden, a sizeable subset of patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 infection have reported lingering symptoms, leading to significant disability and impairment of their daily life activities. These patients are considered to suffer from what has been termed as ""chronic"" or ""long"" COVID-19 or a form of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, and patients experiencing this syndrome have been termed COVID-19 long-haulers. Despite recovery from infection, the persistence of atypical chronic symptoms, including extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pains, brain fogs, anxiety and depression, that could last for months implies an underlying disease pathology that persist beyond the acute presentation of the disease. As opposed to the direct effects of the virus itself, the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be largely responsible for the appearance of these lasting symptoms, possibly through facilitating an ongoing inflammatory process. In this review, we hypothesize potential immunological mechanisms underlying these persistent and prolonged effects, and describe the multi-organ long-term manifestations of COVID-19.","Ramakrishnan, Kashour, Hamid, Halwani, Tleyjeh","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.686029","20210720","SARS-CoV-2; chronic COVID-19; clinical manifestations; immunopathology; long COVID-19; long-haulers; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; post-acute sequelae of COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16065,""

"Sleep, Anxiety, and Academic Performance: A Study of Adolescents From Public High Schools in China","<b>Purpose:</b> Sleep is essential for optimal learning across the developmental pathways. This study aimed to (1) explore whether school start and end times and screen time influenced sleep disturbances in adolescents during the lockdown in China and (2) investigate if sleep disturbances at night and sleep-related impairment (daytime fatigue) influenced adolescents' academic performance and anxiety levels. <b>Methods:</b> Ninety-nine adolescents aged 15-17 years old were recruited from two public schools in Baishan City Jilin Province, China. An online questionnaire was distributed including questions on adolescents' demographics, screen time habits, academic performance, anxiety level, sleep disturbances, and sleep-related impairment. <b>Results:</b> Adolescents who started school earlier and ended school later had a greater severity of sleep disturbances and sleep-related impairment compared with students who started school later and finished earlier. Adolescents who engaged in screen time at bedtime were more likely to have a greater severity of sleep-related impairment than students who reported no screen time use at bedtime. Adolescents who had a greater severity of sleep disturbances had higher anxiety and higher academic achievements than adolescents with less sleep disturbances. Finally, 79.7% of adolescents reported their total sleep duration as &lt;8 h. <b>Conclusions:</b> Adolescents are experiencing sleep disturbances to manage academic demands during COVID-19, which in turn is having a wider impact on their mental health.

"Germaphobia! Does Our Relationship With and Knowledge of Biodiversity Affect Our Attitudes Toward Microbes?","Germaphobia - a pathological aversion to microorganisms - could be contributing to an explosion in human immune-related disorders <i>via</i> mass sterilization of surfaces and reduced exposure to biodiversity. Loss of biodiversity and people's weaker connection to nature, along with poor microbial literacy may be augmenting the negative consequences of germaphobia on ecosystem health. In this study, we created an online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes toward, and knowledge of microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness and interactions with nature and explored the relationships between these variables. Although the study had an international reach (<i>n</i> = 1,184), the majority of responses came from England, United Kingdom (<i>n</i> = 993). We found a significant association between attitudes toward microbes and both duration and frequency of visits to natural environments. A higher frequency of visits to nature per week, and a longer duration spent in nature per visit, was significantly associated with positive attitudes toward microbes. We found no association between nature connectedness and attitudes toward microbes. We found a significant relationship between knowledge of ""lesser known"" microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes toward microbes. However, we also found that people who identified viruses as being microbes expressed less positive views of microbes overall-this could potentially be attributed to a ""COVID-19 effect."" Our results suggest that basic microbial literacy and nature engagement may be important in reducing/preventing germaphobia-associated attitudes. The results also suggest that a virus-centric phenomenon (e.g., COVID-19) could increase broader germaphobia-associated attitudes. As the rise of immune-related disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilization, our findings point to a feasible strategy to potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences. Further research is needed, but greater emphasis on microbial literacy and promoting time spent in nature could potentially be useful in promoting resilience in human health and more positive/constructive attitudes toward the foundations of our ecosystems-the microorganisms.","Robinson, Cameron, Jorgensen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.678752","20210720","COVID-19; germaphobia; microbiome; microorganisms; mysophobia; nature connectedness; nature relatedness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16068,""
"An Italian Adaptation of the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and Attitudes During the Covid-19 Outbreak","Resilience has attracted the interest of the scientific community during the Covid-19 outbreak, as a protective factor in mental health. As the migrant population arguably has one of the most vulnerable profiles in the current health crisis, the aim of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) across native and migrant residents in Italy, and to compare scores across these two populations. Other personal attitudes to the current restrictions were considered. Preliminary psychometrics were tested in a version of the translated instrument with an independent sample. A second independent sample was used to analyse the differences between migrant and native adults. The results showed no differences between the new version and the previous Spanish adaptation or the original instrument. Moreover, no differences were found between the migrant and non-migrant group. BRCS scores were predicted by attitudes toward Covid-19 but not by migrant or native group. These results suggest that the BRCS may be a useful tool to measure resilience in Italy at time of pandemic, irrespective of cultural differences.","Murphy, Lami, Moret-Tatay","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.641213","20210720","Brief Resilient Coping Scale; Covid-19; attitudes; multigroup analysis; psychometric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16069,""
"Study Protocol-Coping With the Pandemics: What Works Best to Reduce Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms in most individuals. Health bodies recommend several coping behaviors to protect against such symptoms, but evidence on the relationship between these behaviors and symptoms mostly comes from cross-sectional studies in convenience samples. We will conduct a prospective longitudinal study of the associations between coping behaviors and subsequent anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in a representative sample of the Spanish general adult population. <b>Methods:</b> We will recruit 1,000 adult participants from all autonomous communities of Spain and with sex, age, and urbanicity distributions similar to those of their populations and assess anxiety and depressive symptoms and coping behaviors using fortnightly questionnaires and real-time methods (ecological momentary assessments) for 1 year. The fortnightly questionnaires will inquire about anxiety and depressive symptoms [General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)] and the frequency of 10 potential coping behaviors (e.g., follow a routine) during the past 2 weeks. In addition, we will collect several variables that could confound or moderate these associations. These will include subjective well-being [International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (I-PANAS-SF) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)], obsessive-compulsive symptoms [Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R)], personality and emotional intelligence [International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short Form (TEIQue-SF)], sociodemographic factors (e.g., work status, housing-built environment), and COVID-19 pandemic-related variables (e.g., hospitalizations or limitations in social gatherings). Finally, to analyze the primary relationship between coping behaviors and subsequent anxiety and depressive symptoms, we will use autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. <b>Discussion:</b> Based on the study results, we will develop evidence-based, clear, and specific recommendations on coping behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Such suggestions might eventually help health bodies or individuals to manage current or future pandemics.","Fortea, Solanes, Pomarol-Clotet, Garcia-Leon, Fortea, Torrent, Varo, Bonnin, Montejo, Alonso, Carmona, Soldevila-MatÃƒÂ­as, Alustiza, ArbÃƒÂ³s, Hidalgo-Mazzei, Grande, Vieta, Fullana, Radua","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.642763","20210720","COVID-19; anxiety; coping behaviors; depressive symptoms; longitudinal study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16070,""
"The Psychological Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Pregnant Women in China","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been reported to have negative psychological impact on mental health. Nonetheless, there are few studies investigating the impacts on pregnant women. This study investigated the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women, and the associated risk factors that moderated this impact. <b>Methods and Materials:</b> A total of 2,798 pregnant participants were recruited from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to assess depression, generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia, respectively, during and before the COVID-19 pandemic. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Results:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, over one third of pregnant participants reported mild depression, around 20% experienced mild generalized anxiety, about one third reported problems with sleeping, and more than 15% felt mild psychological stress. The occurrence of psychological problems was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to before the outbreak. The previously described pattern that pregnant women in the first trimester are more likely to report depression, and those in the third trimester are more likely to report insomnia and psychological stress, was also recognized in our study population. Mental health issues existing before the outbreak were risk factors, while family support was a protective factor in the occurrence of the measured mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data suggest pregnant women's mental health is inevitably affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnant women in the first and third trimester and those who experienced mental issues before the outbreak may be particularly affected.","Zheng, Zhang, Liu, Cheng, Zhou, Lu, Xu, So, Lin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.628835","20210720","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pregnant women; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16071,""

"Identifying Social Determinants of Health and Allocating Resources During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Currently, the world has found itself in a global pandemic with coronavirus. At its start, to limit the spread of this virus, countries, states, and counties have implemented stay-at-home orders and shutdowns. These shutdowns had great impacts on people's well-being and exacerbated social determinants of health. This project aims to identify patient social determinants of health and their associations during the COVID-19 pandemic via telemedicine. A total of 104 patients were surveyed within Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who had not been seen for at least 4 weeks before March 23, 2020 and who did not have a scheduled visit within 4 weeks of the initial survey. Based on a patient's specific response, resources were then allocated to them. Most patients surveyed identified at least 1 social determinant of health, the most common being financial issues (27%), mental health issues (26%), and access to food (19%). A statistically significant relationship was found between patients who identified finances with access to food, access to medication with struggling to care for themselves or others, and physical wellness with mental health. Lastly, an association was found between those who did not identify any difficulties and wanting more information. By identifying needed barriers via telemedicine, we can properly allocate resources to those who need it the most and hope to decrease the potential long-term effects of this current pandemic.","Pappan, Austin, Venkat, Thakkar","https://doi.org/10.1097/IPC.0000000000001003","20210720","COVID-19; public outreach; quality improvement; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","",16073,""
"The association of WTELS as a master motivator with higher executive functioning and better mental health","The goal is to test the validity of the ""Will to exist-live and survive (WTELS) as a master motivator that activates executive functions. A sample of 262 adults administered different measures that included WTELS and executive functions. We conducted hierarchical regressions with working memory deficits (WMD) and inhibition deficits (ID) as dependent variables. We entered in the last steps resilience and WTELS as independent variables. We conducted path analysis with WTELS as independent variables and WMD and ID as outcome variables and resilience and social support as mediating variables. WTELS accounted for the high effect size for lower working memory deficits and medium effect size for lower inhibition deficits. In path analysis, the effects of WTELS on decreased WMD were direct, while its effects on the ID were indirect. PROCESS analysis indicated that WTELS was directly associated with lower depression, anxiety, PTSD, and COVID-19 traumatic stress, and its indirect effects were mediated by lower executive function deficits (Kira et al.,Ã‚Â Psych 12:992-1024 2021c, Kira et al., in press).

"The Spread of COVID-19 in Russia: Immediate Impact on Mental Health of University Students","Amid the spread of COVID-19, a study of mental health in university students from different regions of Russia (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3057) was undertaken during the period from April 9 to April 20, 2020. The results were compared to studies conducted earlier within a large-scale research project examining student mental health. Mental health indicators were analyzed during three different periods: long before the onset of the pandemic (period 1); in the early days of the spread of COVID-19 in Russia, though prior to the implementation of containment measures (period 2); during tough measures to contain the first wave of the pandemic (period 3). The comparison of indicators showed no differences in the levels of psychological well-being (<i>F</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.918; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.4), significantly lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress during the period 1 compared to the periods 2 and 3 (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and the highest levels of anxiety and stress during the period 2.

"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental and physical health in Denmark - a longitudinal population-based study before and during the first wave","In the continuation of the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak in Denmark, unprecedented restrictions with great impact on the citizen's everyday life were implemented. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental and physical health in the Danish population during the spring 2020 first wave outbreak and lockdown. A sample from the adult Danish population (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2190) were included. Self-reported measures of illness worry (Whiteley-6-R), emotional distress (SCL-90), and physical symptom load (SLC-90) were obtained before and during the first wave of the pandemic and compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Impact of covariates on physical and mental health was evaluated with ordinal regression analyses. Results from a tailored questionnaire regarding the Covid-19 pandemic were presented to explore the direct impact of the pandemic. We only found minor increases in illness worry, emotional distress and physical symptom load (0-1 points difference, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007) during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic. Sex, age, education, and physical disease were not associated with illness worry, emotional distress, or physical symptom load.

"Stressors met by quarantined French students during the covid-19 pandemic Their links with depression and sleep disorders","Quarantine during the covid-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with poor psychological health in students. However, no study has systematically examined the stressors perceived by students during this quarantine and their link with psychological health. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to examine the stressors perceived by French students during the Covid-19 quarantine and their links with students' psychological health, i.e., depression and sleep disorders. First, based on the existing literature and interviews with students, we designed a 27-item scale. Then a sample of 2536 French students completed a questionnaire containing the 27 items along with two measures: the CES-D to measure depression and the Jenkins Sleep Scale to assess sleep disorders. The statistical analyses (EFA and CFA) revealed six factors that were correlated with depression and/or sleep disorders. However, regression analyses revealed that among them, ""inactivity and idleness"" and ""academic worries"" were the most associated with depression and sleep disorders. To a lesser extent, ""Precariousness"", ""Lack of trust in information"" and ""Missing the people one care's about"" but not ""fear of the virus"", were also associated with depression and/or sleep disorders. The cross-sectional nature of our data limits the extent to which causal inferences can be made. All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire.

Mixed effects regression models were fit for these outcomes over the period May - August 2020, controlling for pre-pandemic depressive groups (none, mild, moderate-to-severe), demographic characteristics, and early COVID-19 related experiences (such as disruptions in routines, mental health treatment, and social supports). In pre-to-early pandemic comparisons, the 3 pre-pandemic depressive categories varied significantly in anxiety (F<sub>df=2,197</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.93, p &lt; 0.0005) and psychological QOL (F<sub>df=2,196</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.57, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0003).
