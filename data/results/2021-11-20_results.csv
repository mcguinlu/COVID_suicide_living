"Trauma-informed care for the pediatric nurse","Trauma is not limited to medical trauma and includes chronic stressors, toxic stress, adverse childhood events, abuse, and now the COVID-19 pandemic. Principles of trauma-informed care and resiliency guide pediatric nursing care across the life span from birth to adolescence. Trauma-informed care principles are pertinent to the nursing care needs of healthy and ill children from infancy to adolescence across care settings. The purpose of this integrative literature review (IRL) is to elucidate evidence-based practices for pediatric nurses specific to trauma, trauma-informed principles, and the integration of these principles to care. Using Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) methodology, this IRL presents empirical literature to operationalize trauma-informed care for the pediatric nurse through 1) identification of the problem; 2) literature search; 3) data evaluation; 4) data analysis; 5) result presentation. Results are presented in a contemporary framework by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2018) of trauma-awareness for the pediatric nurse, trauma-informed principles, and the integration of these principles to care. Pediatric nurses are in a unique position to offer trauma-informed care by recognizing and managing trauma to include chronic stressors, toxic stress, adverse childhood experiences, and abuse. Pediatric nurses today are caring for patients in a complex and diverse healthcare climate amid the world's worst public health pandemic in living memory. Awareness of trauma, assessment of trauma in pediatrics, and health and resiliency promotion are critical in moving forward post-pandemic. The overview of trauma-informed care provides a guide for the pediatric nurse.","Goddard, Janicek, Etcher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.11.003","20211119","Pediatric trauma; Trauma; Trauma-awareness; Trauma-informed; Trauma-informed care; Trauma-informed care in nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22378,""
"Psychotropic medications sales during COVID-19 outbreak in Italy changed according to the pandemic phases and related lockdowns","We have investigated the psychotropic medications sales (i.e. benzodiazepines, mood stabilisers and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the period from March 2020 to February 2021 compared with the same period in the preceding year. This was a retrospective and observational study. Data were obtained from five pharmacies located in a working-class zone populated by approximately 150,000 people in the urban area of Rome (Italy). A general slight increase in psychotropic medications sales was observed during the whole pandemic period compared with the previous year. Our data showed that (1) the percentage of sales seems to vary according to the pandemic phases and related lockdowns and (2) the sales differ between the classes of medications considered.","Farina, Massullo, De Rossi, Carbone, Serraino, Imperatori","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.10.005","20211119","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychotropic medications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22379,""
"COVID-19 Infodemic and Depressive Symptoms: the impact of the Exposure to News about COVID-19 on the General Paraguayan Population","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase of social stressors and mental health issues in the general population as well as among mentally ill patients. A COVID-19- related ""infodemic"", including too much information in digital and physical environments, has been recognized globally AIM: : This study aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 infodemic (exposure to news related to COVID-19) in terms of depressive symptoms in the Paraguayan general population METHODS: : This was a descriptive and cross-sectional study. An online survey, designed in Google Forms, has been launched nationwide through the most popular social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and messaging applications (WhatsApp, Telegram) in April (1<sup>st</sup>-30<sup>th</sup>) 2021. The Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5) was employed for detecting depressive symptoms RESULTS: : The survey included 1102 responders aged 35.4 Ã‚Â± 12.9 years old, 74.9% were women. MHI-5 mean score was 44.07 Ã‚Â± 14.16 in the general population with 34.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯379) of responders suffering from severe symptoms of depression (&gt;52, as cut-off point). 53.5% of sample reported to have been exposed between 1 to 3 hours to COVID-19 news, daily. An OR 1.933 (95% CI 1.48 - 2.52) was found between the exposure to news and depressive symptoms CONCLUSIONS: : This study suggests that people exposed to a higher number of hours of COVID-19 news were 93.3% more likely to develop depressive symptoms.","Torales, Barrios, O'Higgins, AlmirÃƒÂ³n-Santacruz, Gonzalez-Urbieta, GarcÃƒÂ­a, Rios-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Castaldelli-Maia, Ventriglio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.036","20211119","COVID-19; Depression; Infodemic; News","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22380,""
"Long-term effects of COVID-19 on mental health: A systematic review","Acute effects of COVID-19 can be devastating and life-threatening. Alterations in mental health during the active infection have been documented, but the long-term consequences are less clear. A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on long-term mental health outcomes. Three databases [PubMed, Medline (Ovid) and Cochrane library] were searched between 1<sup>st</sup> October 2019 and 29<sup>th</sup> August 2021 with additional hand searching to identify all published studies reporting symptoms of generalised anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or sleep disturbance in participants at least one month after COVID-19 infection. The prevalence and mean symptom score of each were assessed. Eight hundred and eighty five studies were found, of which 33 were included in the review involving a total of 6743 participants. The studies' risk of bias were typically fair quality. The median study age of participants was 57.8 years old (IQR 49.3-60.7), with 63.0% male (IQR 57.0%-73.0%). Participants typically experienced no or mild symptoms of long-term anxiety (GAD-7, STAI-S, HADS) and depression (PHQ-9, BDI, PHQ-2, HADS). Prevalence varied depending on the measurement tool. Sleep disturbances (primarily insomnia) were most consistently reported as mild. PTSD prevalence was similar to anxiety and depression. The overall effect of the pandemic has been linked with worse psychiatric disorder symptoms. However, the long-term effect from direct COVID-19 infection has been associated with no or mild symptoms. Studies exhibited long-term prevalence of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and sleep disturbances were comparable to general population levels.","Bourmistrova, Solomon, Braude, Strawbridge, Carter","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.031","20211119","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; depression; mental health; sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22381,""
"Investigating the effectiveness of tele-counseling for the mental health of staff in hospitals and COVID-19 clinics: a clinical control trial","To investigate the effectiveness of tele-counseling for the mental health of staff working in hospitals and reference clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the first stage of the study, using a convenience sampling strategy, 313 staff members working at Iran's hospitals and COVID-19 clinics answered a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Short Health Anxiety Inventory online. In a second stage, 95 staff members who were willing to participate in the intervention were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 51) or control (n = 44) groups. The intervention consisted of seven intensive tele-counseling sessions. In the first stage, the percentages of anxiety and depression related to coronavirus were 79.2% and 82.1% and the mean health anxiety score was 17.42. In the intervention phase, anxiety related to coronavirus and to perceived risk of illness (likelihood of illness) were significantly lower in the intervention group in comparison with the control group (p = 0.001). Depression related to coronavirus and anxiety related to the negative consequences of infection were non-significantly reduced in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.08 and 0.12; respectively). Continuous monitoring of the negative psychological impacts on medical staff of outbreaks as well as implementation of appropriate interventions to respond to them should be emphasized in order to improve staff mental health.","Ghazanfarpour, Ashrafinia, Zolala, Ahmadi, Jahani, Hosseininasab","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2020-0176","20211119","Coronavirus; anxiety; clinics; depression; health anxiety; hospitals; staff; tele-counseling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22382,""

"The COVID-19/racial injustice syndemic and mental health among Black Americans: The roles of general and race-related COVID worry, cultural mistrust, and perceived discrimination","This study explored intersecting concerns about COVID-19 and racial injustice against Black people in the United States using a syndemic perspective. Findings from a multistate COVID-19 needs assessment project examined the association of general and race-related concerns about COVID-19 and concerns about police violence against Black people with mental health symptoms in a sample of 2480 Black Americans. The role of cultural mistrust in vaccination status was also examined. Concerns about COVID-19 were positively associated with concerns about police violence and associated with worse mental health. Nonvaccinated individuals were higher in cultural mistrust but lower in perceived discrimination than vaccinated individuals. Perceived discrimination partially mediated the relationship between race-related concerns about COVID-19 and mental health symptoms. Findings can inform the development of culturally responsive strategies to address the syndemic effects of COVID-19 and racial injustice.","Cokley, Krueger, Cunningham, Burlew, Hall, Harris, Castelin, Coleman","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22747","20211119","COVID-19; cultural mistrust; mental health; perceived discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22384,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Portuguese population: Consumption of alcohol, stimulant drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceuticals","The measures implemented by governments worldwide to control and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 have impacted the populations and directly influenced individuals' quality of life and consumption habits. This work investigates the Portuguese population's changes in alcohol, stimulants drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceutical consumptions habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire comprising seven groups of questions-with one group referring to alcohol, stimulant drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceuticals consumption habits-was made available to the general adult population of mainland Portugal from the 26th January through the 31st of March 2021. After applying the inclusion criteria, 1666 questionnaires were selected and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Our results show that 48.9% of the participants have alcohol drinking habits and increased their alcohol consumption by 16% after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Furthermore, 8.7% of the respondents felt the need to increase their consumption of stimulant drinks, especially coffee, the most consumed stimulant drink (77.9%). We also observed that of the 3.1% of respondents who are usual consumers of illegal substances, 26.9% increased their consumption of these substances during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerning pharmaceuticals, 23.2% of the respondents expressed their need to take a therapeutic drug after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The profile of common consumers of alcohol, stimulant drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceuticals in the COVID-19 pandemic context is contrasting and varies according to gender, age, and employment status. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the consumption of alcohol, stimulant drinks, illegal substances, and pharmaceuticals prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, and sleep changes in the Portuguese population. These new consumption patterns have probably aggravated domestic violence, mental diseases, and impairment of family quality of life in the Portuguese population.","Fernandes, Sosa-Napolskij, Lobo, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260322","20211119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22385,""
"Mental Health Screenings: Practices and Patterns of These and Other Health Screenings in US School Districts","Schools' health screenings can identify students' missed health concerns. Data from the 2016 School Health Policies and Practices Study were used to determine the proportion of U.S. school districts with physical and mental health screening policies and the proportion that arrange off-campus mental health services. We also examined differences between districts with and without mental health screening policies regarding having physical health screening policies, patterns of these policies, and off-campus mental health service arrangements. Eleven percent of districts had no policies on any of the four physical health screenings assessed, and 87% lacked policies on mental health screenings, the latter especially concerning considering the impact of COVID-19.

"The Significance of Observing the Risk of Non-communicable Diseases after Large-scale Disasters and Communicable Disease Epidemics","Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a global challenge, accounting for 71% of all deaths worldwide. The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and past huge disasters have affected the prevention and treatment of NCDs and require urgent action. In this narrative review, I will discuss several reports on the risk of NCDs during past disasters and propose possible future directions. Hypertension, the most common NCD, carries a high risk of death due to cerebrovascular, renal, and other complications. Effective use of information and communication technology-based telemedicine is necessary to manage the risk of cardiovascular diseases during disasters and pandemics. We observed the cumulative incidence of metabolic syndrome in subjects from tsunami-affected areas. We found that moving into prefabricated temporary housing was a risk factor for a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome in elderly females. Our follow-up of 1,009 subjects showed a slight, but significant, increase in HbA1c values after a state of emergency was introduced, even though the lockdown was not as stringent as in other countries. In a study elucidating the prevalence of wheezing and eczema symptoms and the associated factors after the Great East Japan Earthquake, psychological effects, such as depression and self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder, were observed, particularly in people with allergic diseases. In recent years, new birth cohort studies have been initiated to complement the studies designed to collect information across multiple generations, such as the Lifelines study in the Netherlands and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study in the UK. It is desirable to assess the effects of COVID-19 to complement the existing cohort studies in Japan as well.","Metoki","https://doi.org/10.31662/jmaj.2021-0126","20211119","COVID-19; Non-communicable diseases; biobank; cohort study; disasters","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22388,""

The study has reacted rapidly and repeatedly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, deploying online questionnaires throughout the pandemic. In November/December 2020, a fourth questionnaire was deployed asking about physical and mental health, lifestyle and behaviours, employment and finances. G0 participants were offered an online questionnaire between 17 <sup>th</sup> November 2020 and 7 <sup>th</sup> February 2021, while G1 participants were offered both online and paper questionnaires between 1 <sup>st</sup> December 2020 and 19 <sup>th</sup> March 2021. Of 15,844 invitations, 8,643 (55%) participants returned the questionnaire (3,101 original mothers [mean age 58.6 years], 1,172 original fathers/partners [mean age 61.5 years] and 4,370 offspring [mean age 28.4 years]). Of these 8,643 participants, 2,012 (23%) had not returned a previous COVID-19 questionnaire, while 3,575 (41%) had returned all three previous questionnaires.

"Understanding the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Lockdowns and Social Isolation on Sleep Quality","The uncertain, ever-changing and an ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic means that it may take some time before we can fully appreciate the negative effect of the pandemic and lockdown on our sleep and mental health. It is increasingly recognised that in the aftermath of pandemic, several persistent sleep, neuropsychiatric and physical sequelae may continue long after the pandemic is over. A body of evidence to date also highlights a significant disparity in sleep and mental health difficulties in specific vulnerable groups in the community, with different temporal profiles and sleep issues that are reported. In this perspective, we argue for a possible mechanistic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its imposed restrictions and social isolation on sleep quality. We similarly discuss some of the potential international differences, as well as similarities, behind reported idiosyncratic biological vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the genesis of sleep issues. Lastly, we propose some possible implementations and innovations that may be needed in restructuring of sleep disorders services in order to benefit recovering COVID-19 patients.","O'Regan, Jackson, Young, Rosenzweig","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S266240","20211119","COVID-19 pandemic; hypersomnia; insomnia; lockdown; sleep; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22390,""
"Association Between Serious Psychological Distress and Loneliness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study with Pregnant Japanese Women","Pregnant women are vulnerable to stress. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic and created significant stress for many people. Social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 has also reduced social interactions, which has increased social isolation and loneliness. Loneliness is thought to increase perceived stress, cause psychological distress, and increase the risk of mental illness, such as depression. This study examined the association between serious psychological distress (SPD) and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant Japanese women. An internet survey of 1022 pregnant women in Japan was conducted between June 1 and July 21, 2021. The 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, 3-item Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale were used as measurement tools. The prevalence of SPD was defined as a K6 score of Ã¢â€°Â¥13. The prevalence of SPD was 16.5%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for SPD were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.10; <i>p</i> = 0.020), history of abortion or miscarriages (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.36; <i>p</i> = 0.034), unemployment (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.45; <i>p</i> = 0.008), fear of COVID-19 (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.17; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and loneliness (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.70; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Pregnant women in Japan showed a high prevalence of SPD. Younger age, unemployment, history of abortion or miscarriages, fear of COVID-19, and loneliness were independently associated with SPD.

"Community psychological and behavioural responses to coronavirus disease 2019 over one year of the pandemic in 2020 in Hong Kong","Monitoring community psychological and behavioural responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is important for informing policy making and risk communication to sustain public compliance with challenging precautionary behaviours and mitigating the psychological impacts. Monthly telephone-based cross-sectional surveys in January-April 2020 and then weekly surveys from May through December 2020 were conducted to monitor changes in public risk perception of COVID-19, personal efficacy in self-protection, confidence in government's ability to control the pandemic, precautionary behaviours, perceived impact of precautionary behaviours, psychological fatigue and distress in Hong Kong, and examine their inter-relationships. While worry about contracting COVID-19 increased, personal efficacy and confidence in government declined as the community incidence of COVID-19 increased. The public maintained high compliance with most precautionary behaviours throughout but relaxed behaviours that were more challenging when disease incidence declined. Public confidence in government was persistently low throughout, of which, a lower level was associated with more psychological fatigue, lower compliance with precautionary behaviours and greater psychological distress. Perceived greater negative impact of precautionary behaviours was also associated with more psychological fatigue which in turn was associated with relaxation of precautionary behaviours. Female, younger and unemployed individuals reported greater psychological distress throughout different stages of the pandemic. Risk communication should focus on promoting confidence in self-protection and pandemic control to avoid helplessness to act when the pandemic resurges. Policy making should prioritize building public trust, enhancing support for sustaining precautionary behaviours, and helping vulnerable groups to adapt to the stress during the pandemic.","Liao, Xiao, Cheung, Ng, Lam, Ni, Cowling","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00616-9","20211119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22392,""

"Intervention Effect of Dance Therapy Based on the Satir Model on the Mental Health of Adolescents during the COVID-19 Epidemic","To investigate the intervention effect of dance therapy based on the Satir Model on the mental health of adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 62 adolescents with depression were selected using Symptom Checklist 90 and randomly divided into two groups according to the matching of male and female participants; the experiment group had 32 members and the control group had 30 members. The experiment group received group psychological intervention and dance therapy based on the Satir Model, whereas the control group was not given any intervention. After the intervention, the scores of the experiment group in anxiety and depression are lower than those prior to intervention (p&lt;0.01) and of the control group (p&lt;0.01); the scores of the experiment group in life satisfaction, psychological resilience and their dimensions are higher than those prior to intervention (p&lt;0.01) and higher than those of the control group (p&lt;0.01). The combination of group intervention and dance therapy based on the Satir Model is a feasible method to effectively alleviate adolescents' anxiety and depression, promote their life satisfaction and psychological resilience, and thus improve their mental health.","Shao","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.411","20211119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22395,""
"Supporting population mental health and wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: protocol for a sequential mixed-method study","The global COVID-19 pandemic has reported to have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of individuals around the world. Mental health system infrastructure, primarily developed to support individuals through in-person care, struggled to meet rising demand for services even prior to COVID-19. With public health guidelines requiring the use of physical distancing during the pandemic, digital mental health supports may be one way to address the needs of the population. Despite this, barriers exist in promoting and supporting access to existing and emerging digital resources. Text messaging may address some of these barriers, extending the potential reach of these digital interventions across divides that may separate some vulnerable or disadvantaged groups from essential mental health supports. Building on an existing knowledge synthesis project identifying key digital resources for improved mental health, this research will establish low-tech connections to assess need and better match access to services for those who need it most. The aim of this study is to codesign a customised two-way texting service to explore need and better align access to mental health supports for Canadians located in Saskatchewan during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study will be completed in Saskatchewan, Canada. For this project, the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework will be used to support three phases of a sequential mixed-method study. An advisory committee of Saskatchewan residents will guide this work with the study team. A 10-week service will be launched to connect individuals with appropriately suited digital mental health interventions through the use of text messaging. In phase 1, implementation and prototyping will be conducted with collaborative codesign for key elements related to features of an enrolment survey and initial messaging content. Phase 2 will focus on advancing the effectiveness of the service using quantitative user data. In phase 3, an embedding approach will be used to integrate both qualitative and quantitative data collected to understand the overall acceptability, satisfaction and perceived benefit of the text messaging service. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics will be used as analytic methods. This study has received approval from the Research Ethics Board at the University of Saskatchewan. A knowledge dissemination plan has been developed that includes traditional academic approaches such as conference presentations, and academic publications, as well as mainstream approaches such as social media, radio and dissemination through the advisory committee.","Risling, Carlberg, Kassam, Moss, Janssen, Iduye, Strudwick","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052259","20211119","COVID-19; co-design; digital health; mental health; nursing informatics; population mental health; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22396,""
"Breaking the cycle: A public-private partnership to combat the American opioid epidemic","There has been an increased focus on the opioid epidemic in the United States, yet policy-based interventions such as prescription limits, restrictions on doctor shopping, and notification programs for high-volume prescribers have had no significant impact. In this paper, the authors explore a novel public health policy: a joint public-private partnership between the federal government and hospitals to establish long-term treatment centers for patients admitted to the emergency department after an overdose. These centers would provide medication for opioid use disorder, give individuals the necessary support for recovery, and reduce healthcare expenditures. Similar longitudinal strategies may be used in other areas of public health.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2021.100592","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","",22397,""
