"A Systematic Review and Provisional Metanalysis on Psychopathologic Burden on Health Care Workers of Coronavirus Outbreaks","Background: The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) shows several similarities with previous outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)  Aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide evidence of the psychopathologic burden on health care workers (HCWs) of the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks to get lessons for managing the current burden of COVID-19 outbreak  Method: According to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA Statement, the study quantified the effects of frontline work on mental health of HCWs  Major databases â€” Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science â€” were searched for observational and case-control studies evaluating mental health indexes reported by front-line work  This study computed the percentage of sample that reported clinically significant levels of psychiatric symptoms  Cohenâ€™s d was used for comparing mental health outcomes of health care workers directly involved in addressing pandemic emergency with a control group that was not directly exposed to such conditions  Pooled effect sizes (dw) were estimated whenever at least three independent studies yielded data  Heterogeneity of findings and bias of publication were estimated as well  Findings: Fifteen studies have been selected for a total of 7,393 HCWs  From 9 6% to 51% of HCWs reported symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and from 20% to 75% reported psychiatric symptoms, with a prevalence of anxiety and depression  From one to the three years after outbreak, from 2% to 19% reported PTSD symptoms and from 5% to 90% psychiatric symptoms  Interestingly, HWCs who were directly involved in pandemic emergency showed significantly higher depressive and anxious symptoms (dw = 66 ( 46â€“ 85);p &lt; 001) than ones who were not directly exposed  Similarly, the direct involvement significantly affected the severity of PTSD symptoms (dw = 30 ( 21â€“ 39);p &lt; 001)  Conclusion: Health care professionals in general and most of all frontline workers showed an association with a likely risk of developing psychiatric disorders following outbreaks and for at least three years later  Mental health interventions for professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented  Further studies are warranted to investigate long-term consequences carefully, and to look for mediating and buffering factors as well  The role of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in delivering adequate interventions is critically important  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Galli, Pozzi, Ruggiero, Mameli, Cavicchioli, Barbieri, Canevini, Priori, Pravettoni, Sani and Ferrucci","Galli, F.; Pozzi, G.; Ruggiero, F.; Mameli, F.; Cavicchioli, M.; Barbieri, S.; Canevini, M.

"From Shattered Goals to Meaning in Life: Life Crafting in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel COVID-19 pandemic has created an extraordinary situation for our generation, with many countries being on lockdown  With this, new situation comes many psychological challenges not only for health care workers and people suffering from COVID-19 but also for the general population  Adapting to the new situation can be demanding  Experts have suggested that emotions during this situation are very similar to grief, and people experience emptiness and sadness about the loss of their normal lives, which can even lead to a loss of meaning in life  In this paper, we argue that life crafting could offer a way to help people cope with the situation and renew their sense of meaning  A life crafting intervention is based on theoretical insights from multiple areas of research, like positive psychology, expressive writing, and the salutogenesis framework  Life-crafting interventions help people find meaning in life by focusing on their ideal future, and helping them set goals, and make concrete plans to achieve those goals and overcome obstacles  Since having a clear purpose or meaning in life has been shown to have many benefits, we propose that it can also help people to cope with the psychological effects of the pandemic  A life-crafting intervention can offer people a chance to evaluate their goals in a time of uncertainty and rediscover meaning in life to guide them through these difficult times  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 de Jong, Ziegler and Schippers","de Jong, E.

"Addressing a dual public health emergency: supporting physicians to prescribe opioid medications: CMAJ","With respect to COVID-19 prevention, the Canadian government defines a category of clinically vulnerable people in which those with ""mild to moderate respiratory disease"" and those with a ""weakened immune system as the result of certain conditions or medicines they are taking"" are advised to take extra care 2 Accordingly, patients with chronic opioid dependence should be included in the clinically vulnerable high-risk group  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are facing a severe shortage of clean opioids  Tyndall makes the important point that physicians in British Columbia have been cautious in prescribing opioid medications despite clinical guidance being provided during the COVID-19 pandemic 1 The cautious approach to prescribing opioid medications may be the result of messages physicians have become accustomed to,3 specifically messages that stigmatize opioids and instill fear in prescribing physicians that their patients may become addicted and ultimately succumb to their addiction 3 It is important to address the discomforts and challenges that physicians have in regard to prescribing opioids and encourage physicians to consider additional factors such as socioeconomic status, mental health and substance use problems when having conversations about opioids with patients 4 We suggest that further resources be created to support physicians in becoming more comfortable prescribing opioid medications, given that most physicians lack proper training to optimally prescribe opioids 5 Recent guidance from the British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, which addresses both the overdose and COVID-19 crises, provides clinical support for prescribing health care professionals, including valuable case studies and microinduction protocols 6 However, additional resources to support health care professionals in reflecting on their positionality in regard to prescribing opioids and in developing additional confidence in their ability to manage the care of patients with opioid use disorder would be a good addition to the guideline","Bandara, Nilanga Aki BSc, Mehrnoush, Vahid M.

"COVID-19 and the 24/7 News Cycle: Does COVID-19 News Exposure Affect Mental Health?","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has upended nearly every aspect of social life in the United States and abroad  People turn to news to provide public health updates about the virus, such as reports of new cases and deaths, but also to understand how COVID-19 is affecting jobs and the economy  The news, irrespective of its format, serves as a central conduit of information during the pandemic  Prior research examining public traumas, such as terrorist attacks, suggests that greater media intake may also amplify perceived threats about the virus and therefore have a negative effect on mental health  We argue that in the absence of a solution to the virus, such as a vaccine, greater COVID-19 media viewing is likely to heighten uncertainty and anxiousness about the future threat the virus poses to health and well-being, which should in turn increase psychological distress  Drawing on a unique data set of U S  residents in mid- to late March 2020, the authors examine the relationships among COVID-19 news consumption, perceptions of COVID-19 threats to health and economic well-being, and psychological distress  The findings suggest that greater COVID-19 media consumption is associated with greater psychological distress and that approximately two thirds of this effect operates indirectly through increased perceptions of COVID-19 threats  Â© The Author(s) 2020","Stainback, K.; Hearne, B.

"Depression, Anxiety, and Lifestyle Among Essential Workers: A Web Survey From Brazil and Spain During the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: Essential workers have been shown to present a higher prevalence of positive screenings for anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals from countries with socioeconomic inequalities may be at increased risk for mental health disorders. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and their comorbidity among essential workers in Brazil and Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web survey was conducted between April and May 2020 in both countries. The main outcome was a positive screening for depression only, anxiety only, or both. Lifestyle was measured using a lifestyle multidimensional scale adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic (Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation-Confinement). A multinomial logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the factors associated with depression, anxiety, and the presence of both conditions. RESULTS: From the 22,786 individuals included in the web survey, 3745 self-reported to be essential workers. Overall, 8.3% (n=311), 11.6% (n=434), and 27.4% (n=1027) presented positive screenings for depression, anxiety, and both, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, the multinomial model showed that an unhealthy lifestyle increased the likelihood of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.00, 95% CI 2.72-5.87), anxiety (AOR 2.39, 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and both anxiety and depression (AOR 8.30, 95% CI 5.90-11.7). Living in Brazil was associated with increased odds of depression (AOR 2.89, 95% CI 2.07-4.06), anxiety (AOR 2.81, 95%CI 2.11-3.74), and both conditions (AOR 5.99, 95% CI 4.53-7.91). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions addressing lifestyle may be useful in dealing with symptoms of common mental disorders during the strain imposed among essential workers by the COVID-19 pandemic. Essential workers who live in middle-income countries with higher rates of inequality may face additional challenges. Ensuring equitable treatment and support may be an important challenge ahead, considering the possible syndemic effect of the social determinants of health.","De Boni, Raquel Brandini; BalanzÃ¡-MartÃ­nez, Vicent; Mota, Jurema Correa; Cardoso, Taiane De Azevedo; Ballester, Pedro; Atienza-Carbonell, Beatriz; Bastos, Francisco I; Kapczinski, Flavio","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22835","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(10): e22835, 2020 Oct 30.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(10): e22835, 2020 Oct 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7028,""

"Personality Disorders in Time of Pandemic","We report evidence on the negative psychological effects of pandemics in people with personality disorders (PDs) and on the role of personality pathology in compliance with mitigation-related behaviors. Considering the paucity of studies, after a description of the main features of PDs, on the basis of the current literature on pandemic and quarantine mental health impact, we trace some clinical hypotheses. Paranoid traits and detachment (cluster A) might lead to worse psychological outcomes. Cluster B patients may show more intense stress-related reactions and react strongly to social distancing, especially considering borderline personality disorder. Cluster C patients might be particularly prone to anxiety and stress due to fear of contagion and may be less flexible in adaptation to new routines. Evidence on compliance with mitigation measures is mixed, with lower compliance in cluster B patients and higher in cluster C ones. We suggest that PD patients might be particularly affected by pandemics. Furthermore, they might react differently, according to their main diagnosis. Similarly, compliance with mitigation measures may differ according to specific PDs. Our results should be considered as a starting point to reflect on therapeutic strategies to be adopted in the post-COVID-19 situation.","Preti, Di Pierro, Fanti, Madeddu, Calati","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01204-w","20201110","COVID-19; Epidemic; Mental health; Pandemic; Personality disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7031,""
"Past as Prologue: The Effects of the COVID-19 Economic Downturn on Medicaid Coverage for Podiatry Services","As of 2016, Medicaid accounted for nearly 20% of state general fund budgets. Optional Medicaid services like podiatry are often subject to cost-cutting measures in periods of economic downturn, as was the case in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis. Although the cuts were intended as a cost-saving measure, research indicates they had the opposite effect. The restriction and limitation of these services during the Great Recession resulted in both poorer health outcomes for beneficiaries, and poorer financial outcomes for state Medicaid programs. With states citing record levels of unemployment as of April 2020 and projecting significant declines in annual revenue in 2021, the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to rival those of the Great Recession. Given the historical precedent for restricting or eliminating optional Medicaid services as a cost-saving measure, it is likely that podiatric services will once again come under scrutiny. Previous efforts by state-level podiatric societies have proven successful in lobbying for the reinstatement of coverage under Medicaid by conveying evidence of the negative outcomes associated with elimination to stakeholders. The specialty must once again engage policymakers by drawing on evidence gleaned and lessons learned from past cuts of optional Medicaid services to avert counterproductive coverage restrictions intended to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Brewer, Lanese, Appel, Cairns, Armstrong","https://doi.org/10.7547/20-225","20201110","COVID; Cost; Economy; Medicaid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7032,""

"Exposure to COVID-19 pandemic stress: Associations with depression and anxiety in emerging adults in the United States","Stressful events due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are likely to have profound effects on mental health, and validated methods for assessing these experiences and associations with psychopathology are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Emerging adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results supported the validity/reliability of PSQ total scores and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.","Kujawa, Green, Compas, Dickey, Pegg","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23109","20201110","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; pandemics; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7034,""

"COVID-19, Moral Conflict, Distress, and Dying Alone","COVID-19 has truly affected most of the world over the past many months, perhaps more than any other event in recent history. In the wake of this pandemic are patients, family members, and various types of care providers, all of whom share different levels of moral distress. Moral conflict occurs in disputes when individuals or groups have differences over, or are unable to translate to each other, deeply held beliefs, knowledge, and values. Such conflicts can seriously affect healthcare providers and cause distress during disastrous situations such as pandemics when medical and human resources are stretched to the point of exhaustion. In the current pandemic, most hospitals and healthcare institutions in the United States have not allowed visitors to come to the hospitals to see their family or loved ones, even when the patient is dying. The moral conflict and moral distress (being constrained from doing what you think is right) among care providers when they see their patients dying alone can be unbearable and lead to ongoing grief and sadness. This paper will explore the concepts of moral distress and conflict among hospital staff and how a system-wide provider wellness programme can make a difference in healing and health.","Anderson-Shaw, Zar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11673-020-10040-9","20201110","COVID-19; End of life; Moral conflict; Moral distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7036,""

In the current study, we used the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to assess the response to fear within health staff in Mexico. This was a cross-sectional survey study in which we administered the Spanish version of the FCV-19S to hospital staff. The FCV-19S is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of fear caused by COVID-19. A total of 2860 participants-1641 female and 1218 male personnel from three hospitals-were included in the study. The internal reliability of the scale was good, with Cronbach's alpha of .902. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the seven items of the FCV-19S, showing good model fit (<i>Ãâ€¡</i><sup>2</sup> (7)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29.40, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; CFIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.99; TLIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.99; RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03; SRMRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.010; AICÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°71.40).

Our survey shows a significantly higher level of fear in nursing and administrative personnel, which may be explained by the nursing staff being in close contact with infected patients and the administrative staff lacking understanding of the possible implications of the infection, compared with nonclinical hospital personnel. Our results are consistent with those of other researchers.

"Will prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 define a birth cohort with accelerated aging in the century ahead?","The 1918 Influenza pandemic had long-term impacts on the cohort exposed inÃ‚Â utero which experienced earlier adult mortality, and more diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and depression after age 50. It is possible that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will also have long-term impacts on the cohort that was inÃ‚Â utero during the pandemic, from exposure to maternal infection and/or the stress of the pandemic environment. We discuss how COVID-19 disease during pregnancy may affect fetal and postnatal development with adverse impacts on health and aging. Severe maternal infections are associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response, thromboembolic events, and placental vascular malperfusion. We also discuss how inÃ‚Â utero exposure to the stress of the pandemic, without maternal infection, may impact health and aging. Several recently initiated birth cohort studies are tracking neonatal health following inÃ‚Â utero severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. We suggest these cohort studies develop plans for longer-term observations of physical, behavioral, and cognitive functions that are markers for accelerated aging, as well as methods to disentangle the effects of maternal infection from stresses of the pandemic environment. In utero exposure to COVID-19 disease could cause developmental difficulties and accelerated aging in the century ahead. This brief review summarizes elements of the developmental origins of health, disease, and ageing and discusses how the COVID-19 pandemic might exacerbate such effects.

"Rehabilitation services lockdown during the COVID-19 emergency: the mental health response of caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities","The present study investigated the impact of the COVID-19-related rehabilitation services lockdown on the mental health of caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Between 26 March and 11 May 2020, 84 caregivers filled out ad-hoc and standardized questionnaires through an online survey in order to measure their psychological response to the emergency and lockdown as well as their levels of parenting stress, anxiety and depression. Worries about COVID-19 contagion and concerns for the child left without rehabilitation programs were the greatest sources of mental health burden for caregivers. Nonetheless, only the concerns for the child were significantly associated with caregivers' reports of stress, depressive and anxious symptoms. These findings highlight the burden faced by caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities during the COVID-19 emergency in Italy. These families should be considered as a high-risk population that requires dedicated healthcare attention, such as promoting continuity of care by investing in tele-rehabilitation programs. Implications for rehabilitation Caregivers of children with disability reported symptoms of anxiety and depression during COVID-19 emergency. Major concerns regarded COVID-19 contagion risk and child development during rehabilitation lockdown. Caregivers' psychological symptoms were associated with concerns for child development during the lockdown.

"The future of rehabilitation in the United Kingdom National Health Service: Using the COVID-19 crisis to promote change, increasing efficiency and effectiveness","Rehabilitation services in the UK are inadequate, with insufficient capacity or flexibility to meet the needs of patients after Covid-19. Rehabilitation developed in a piecemeal way, focused on specific problems: spinal cord injury, burns, polio, stroke, back pain, equipment and adaptations etc. Rehabilitation is also provided using other names (e.g. intermediate care). Patients with complex needs do not fit easily within this system. After Covid-19, patients have problems that cross existing condition-specific and/or treatment-specific services. Covid-19 has exposed the lack of any coherent organisational principle underlying development or commissioning of rehabilitation services. Consequently, in order to have their needs met, patients either have to engage with two or more separate services or they receive good management for some problems and sub-optimal management for other problems. The multitude of small specific services need to coalesce into an integrated service able to meet all the needs of any patient referred. Second, rehabilitation needs to be fully integrated into all healthcare services. The purpose of healthcare is to '<i>improve our health and well-being .Ã¢â‚¬â€ž.Ã¢â‚¬â€ž. to stay as well as we can to the end of our lives</i>'. (NHS constitution) All healthcare services need to consider patients holistically, giving equal attention to disease, disability, and distress. Rehabilitation, acute care, mental health and palliative care services need to work in parallel to achieve this purpose. Healthcare providers, supported by commissioners and rehabilitation experts, could achieve structural and organisational change, meeting the needs of patients.","Wade","https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215520971145","20201110","Covid-19; health; organisation; purpose; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7043,""
"A Review on COVID-19 Mediated Impacts and Risk Mitigation Strategies for Dental Health Professionals","In the light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), dentistry is facing unprecedented challenges. The closure of clinics has impacted dental health professionals (DHPs) not only financially but also psychologically. In this review, these consequences are discussed in detail to highlight the challenges that DHPs are facing thus far, in both developing and developed nations. Compromised mental health among DHPs is an important area that requires attention during this difficult period. Although, in previous pandemics, dentists have not worked on the frontline, the article discusses how their wide range of skillsets can be leveraged if another wave of COVID-19 pandemic appears. Finally, guidelines to reopen clinics and patient management have been discussed in detail that could serve as a quick reference guide for DHPs.","Sharma, Parolia, Kanagasingam","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1718240","20201109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7044,""

"COVID-19 Transmission in a Psychiatric Long-Term Care Rehabilitation Facility: An Observational Study","To report the clinical characteristics and transmission rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community inpatient long-term care psychiatric rehabilitation facility designed for persons with serious mental illness to provide insight into transmission and symptom patterns and emerging testing protocols, as well as medical complications and prognosis. This study examined a cohort of 54 residents of a long-term care psychiatric rehabilitation program from March to April 2020. Baseline demographics, clinical diagnoses, and vital signs were examined to look for statistical differences between positive versus negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) groups. During the early phase of the pandemic, the facility closely followed the local shelter-in-place order (starting March 19, 2020) and symptom-based testing. Of the residents, the primary psychiatric diagnoses were schizoaffective disorder: 28 (51.9%), schizophrenia: 21 (38.9%), bipolar I disorder: 3 (5.5%), and unspecified psychotic disorder: 2 (3.7%). Forty (74%) of 54 residents tested positive for SARS-COV-2, with a doubling time of 3.9 days. There were no statistical differences between the positive SARS-COV-2 versus negative groups for age or race/ethnicity. Psychiatric and medical conditions were not significantly associated with contracting SARS-COV-2, with the exception of obesity (n = 17 [43%] positive vs n = 12 [86%] negative, P = .01). Medical monitoring of vital signs and symptoms did not lead to earlier detection. All of the residents completely recovered, with the last resident no longer showing any symptoms 24 days from the index case. Research is needed to determine optimal strategies for long-term care mental health settings that incorporate frequent testing and personal protective equipment use to prevent rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2.","Xiong, Atkin, Moquin, Candido, Beilenson, Kasirye, Wasserman, Blum, Hilty","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.20m02765","20201110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7046,""
"Monitoring the psychological, social, and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population: Context, design and conduct of the longitudinal COVID-19 psychological research consortium (C19PRC) study","The C19PRC study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the adult population of the UK, Republic of Ireland, and Spain. This paper describes the conduct of the first two waves of the UK survey (the &quot;parent&quot; strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey was designed to assess: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders as well as the role of (3) psychological factors and (4) social and political attitudes, in influencing the public's response to the pandemic. Quota sampling (age, sex, and household income) was used to recruit a nationally representative sample of adults. Two thousand and twenty five adults were recruited at baseline, and 1406 were followed-up one-month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in relation to economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample. The C19PRC study data has strong generalizability to facilitate and stimulate interdisciplinary research on important public health questions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.","McBride, Murphy, Shevlin, Gibson-Miller, Hartman, Hyland, Levita, Mason, Martinez, McKay, Stocks, Bennett, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Karatzias, Valiente, Vazquez, Bentall","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1861","20201109","COVID-19; general population; longitudinal; psychological; survey methodology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7047,""
"Changes in Depression and Physical Activity Among College Students on a Diverse Campus After a COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Order","The numerous negative health impacts of COVID-19, which include expected changes to psychiatric illness and physical activity (PA), are disproportionately distributed in the United States. Mental illnesses and physical inactivity are prevalent among U.S. college students. This study examined whether there was a change in minutes of PA and depression scores after a stay-at-home order and examined predictors of these changes. An online survey was sent to all undergraduate and graduate students attending a large, diverse university via an electronic newsletter. The survey requested information about demographic and academic data, cardiorespiratory fitness, and depression symptoms. Paired t-tests and logistic regression were employed. Our sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°194) was predominantly female (73%), young (mean age of 25), not a sexual minority (82%), and had a mean 3.4 GPA. Students reported worse depression scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and fewer minutes of PA (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) after the stay-at-home order. There was a small but significant (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04) correlation between changes in total minutes of PA and depression scores. Senior (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and Hispanic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03) students were less likely to report worsening depression scores than freshmen and white students, respectively. Asian students were significantly more likely than white students to report decreased PA. This study suggests that COVID-19 and its consequences may be contributing to reduced PA and greater depression symptoms in college students and that sub-groups have been affected differently. Targeted interventions to promote PA and support mental health may bolster the ability for resilience of college students.","Coughenour, Gakh, Pharr, Bungum, Jalene","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00918-5","20201109","COVID-19; College students; Depression; Mental health; Physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7048,""
"Psycho-social impact of social distancing and isolation due to the COVID-19 containment measures on patients with physical disabilities","While the Covid-19 pandemic was spreading worldwide, the Italian government stated lockdown, with a drastic reorganization in of healthcare systems. The psychological and social effects of the pandemic and to the restrictions of freedom could have had a detrimental impact on people with physical disabilities, for whom well-being depends strongly on their social environment. Our main aim was to describe the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health, social condition and illness perception among patients with disabilities, to provide early interventions for this particularly vulnerable population. For this purpose, we performed a specific screening protocol to detect the prevalence of any psychological distress. Cross-sectional observational study. Telephonic interview administered to patients and their caregivers attending the Neurorehabilitation unit of the University Hospital of Pisa. 134 patients with physical disability related to neurological disorders, who had their outpatient appointment cancelled, because of the government dispositions, were enrolled. A specific questionnaire (COVID19-q) was designed to test patients' psychosocial state, including a section addressed to the caregiver. Moreover, a standardized psychological evaluation, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), was also performed. Results show a different impact in our study population compared to the general population on psychological aspect. Patients did not manifest any clinically relevant distress, as assessed with CORE-OM. However, patients with higher disability degree reported a statistically lower outcome in the social function and in the well-being domains and an increase in risk behaviour. Results from COVID19-q show that most of our patients reported none or mild change in their psycho-social habits and perception of illness during lockdown. However, reduction of family cohesion and lack of healthcare support are two important aspects that people with disability had to face with during the pandemic emergency. People with physical disabilities surprisingly shown milder effects of the pandemic on their psychological state and good coping skills in facing social isolation, manifesting resilience resources. However, the is a need to give concrete support to healthcare and social care, especially in the management of severe disability. This unexpected and reassuring result may reveal a worrying scenario regarding the social participation and quality of life of people with disabilities: were they already in lockdown?","Dalise, Tramonti, Armienti, Niccolini, Caniglia Tenaglia, Chisari","https://doi.org/10.23736/S1973-9087.20.06535-1","20201109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7049,""
"The first 6 months of HIV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection: outcomes for 6947 individuals","The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical outcomes of people living with HIV (PWH) coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several reports from single centers have described increased, decreased, or no difference in outcomes of COVID-19 in PWH. These studies have come from a range of locations, each with different underlying HIV prevalence and access to various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Differences in healthcare quality, access and policies may also affect reported outcomes in PWH across different locations, making interpretation of results more challenging. Meanwhile, different components of ART have been proposed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or disease progression. The current review considers 6 months of data across geographic regions with a range of healthcare quality and access and ART regimens to generate a wider view of COVID-19 outcomes in PWH. Taken together, these studies indicate that HIV infection may be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, but comorbidities appear to play a larger role than HIV-specific variables in outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH. ART does not appear to protect from COVID-19 disease acquisition, progression or death.","Johnston","https://doi.org/10.1097/COH.0000000000000654","20201109","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7050,""
"Adaptation or Revolution: Telemental Health and Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nursing During COVID-19","This article will describe the current COVID-19 crisis and the evolving mental health concerns associated with it, discuss how mental health practice has changed, and ways in which psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) can adapt and prepare for the future. A search of current literature on the COVID-19 crisis, and topics relevant to the mental health components associated with the pandemic are reviewed. Telemental health (TMH) and PMHNP practice are discussed as they relate to the unfolding picture of the viral pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis is having far-reaching implications for mental health treatment and in particular for PMHNPs in practice settings. There have been widespread consequences of the containment measures used for the protection and mitigation of the disease. One such result has been the inability of patients to have face-to-face contact with their providers. The role of TMH has become increasingly important as an adaptation in professional practice. Technology has rapidly transformed traditional practice due to the COVID-19 crisis and there is strong evidence that it is well accepted by patients and providers. It is incumbent on PMHNPs to embrace TMH and become educated on best practices and TMH services.","Schroeder","https://doi.org/10.1177/1078390320970638","20201109","COVID-19; coronavirus; psychiatric nurse practitioner; telemental health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7051,""
"Evaluation of lifestyle, attitude and stressful impact amid COVID-19 among adults in Shanghai, China","The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological health and mental health-related lifestyles in Shanghai, China. In the cross-sectional study conducted in May 2020, participants were asked to complete a validated questionnaire including the impact of event scale (IES), social and family support, lifestyle changes, and indicators of negative mental health impact. A total of 430 participants (303 females and 127 males) completed the questionnaire. The overall mean of IES score was 32.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 12.2, indicating a moderate-to-severe mental stress impact. Moreover, there were 68.4% of participant who had IES score Ã¢â€°Â¥26. Females were more likely to get increased support from family and friends, share feeling with them and others, and care for family member's feeling (all P &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). In conclusion, although the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with high stressful impact, it had associated with some positive mental-health related changes in an urban environment.","Cao, Ma, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2020.1841887","20201109","COVID-19; Urban health; stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-11","",7052,""
