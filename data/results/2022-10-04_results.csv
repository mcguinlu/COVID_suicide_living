"Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System: 70 years of responding to the expected and preparing for the unexpected","Crucial to this process are sentinel physician and hospital networks where samples are collected from patients with febrile respiratory infections;trained laboratory staff to identify the causative pathogen;and epidemiologists and public health staff to collect data and evaluate pathogen spread and disease severity in susceptible populations. GISRS participants are country nominated and WHO designated entities, including 148 National Influenza Centres (NICs), seven Collaborating Centres for Influenza, four Essential Regulatory Laboratories, and 13 H5 Reference Laboratories.2 GISRS has grown from having representation in 25 countries at its inception to include 158 institutions in 127 countries, areas, and territories at present.2 During the past seven decades, clinicians, scientists, and other personnel have used cutting-edge laboratory techniques and epidemiological tools to deliver GISRS's three key outputs: recommendations for the composition of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines;scientific support for public health decision makers;and contributions to global pandemic preparedness for influenza and other respiratory pathogens.","Ziegler, Thedi, Moen, Ann, Zhang, Wenqing, Cox, Nancy J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01741-X","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Lancet; 400(10357):981-982, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38611,""
"Depression detection based on linear and nonlinear speech features in I-vector/SVDA framework","This study proposes depression detection systems based on the i-vector framework for classifying speakers as depressed or healthy and predicting depression levels according to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Linear and non-linear speech features are investigated as front-end features to i-vectors. To take advantage of the complementary effects of features, i-vector systems based on linear and non-linear features are combined through the decision-level fusion. Variability compensation techniques, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Within-Class Covariance Normalization (WCCN), are widely used to reduce unwanted variabilities. A more generalizable technique than the LDA is required when limited training data are available. We employ a support vector discriminant analysis (SVDA) technique that uses the boundary of classes to find discriminatory directions to address this problem. Experiments conducted on the 2014 Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge and Workshop (AVEC 2014) depression database indicate that the best accuracy improvement obtained using SVDA is about 15.15% compared to the uncompensated i-vectors. In all cases, experimental results confirm that the decision-level fusion of i-vector systems based on three feature sets, TEO-CB-Auto-Env+<U+0394>, Glottal+<U+0394>, and MFCC+<U+0394>+<U+0394><U+0394>, achieves the best results. This fusion significantly improves classifying results, yielding an accuracy of 90%. The combination of SVDA-transformed BDI-II score prediction systems based on these three feature sets achieved RMSE and MAE of 8.899 and 6.991, respectively, which means 29.18% and 30.34% improvements in RMSE and MAE, respectively, over the baseline system on the test partition. Furthermore, this proposed combination outperforms other audio-based studies available in the literature using the AVEC 2014 database.","Mobram, Shamim, Mansour, Vali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105926","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computers in Biology and Medicine; 149, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38612,""
"Identifying factors for poorer educational outcomes that may be exacerbated by COVID-19: A systematic review focussing on at-risk school children and adolescents","School closures across Australia in response to COVID-19 have persisted since 2020, with rising mental health problems in children and adolescents, alongside rising negative family health and socioeconomic outcomes. Further, some children and young people who were already experiencing disadvantage pre-pandemic may be at heightened risk of poorer educational outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify the factors for poorer educational outcomes that may be exacerbated by COVID-19 amongst disadvantaged school students. Key development stages of disadvantage were identified: young children who started school behind, older students already at risk of disengagement from school and children and young people who have had contact with the child protection system. Five databases were systematically searched, across two search periods. A total of 69 Australian, peer-reviewed articles, published in 2005â€“2021, examining risk factors for poor educational outcomes for children attending school met the inclusion criteria and were included in final analyses. Our findings provide evidence of key risk factors that make these populations susceptible to worsening outcomes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and of the critical importance of ongoing research to guide policy and practice support for these at-risk groups.

"Black-and-white thinking and conspiracy beliefs prevent parents from vaccinating their children against COVID-19","Understanding predictors of parents' willingness to vaccinate their children appears fundamental to promote vaccine acceptability, especially in a pandemic scenario. The present study aimed to investigate the role of conspiracy beliefs and absolutist thinking in parental attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine, and the predictive role of parents' individual differences on decisions against children's vaccination. An online survey was administered to 415 parents of children aged 5â€“11, at the very beginning of the vaccination targeting this population in Italy. Results showed that absolutism predicted the tendency to believe in conspiracies, associated with a negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine administration to children. Moreover, mothers were less willing to vaccinate children and parents of children aged 5â€“7 were more hesitant, or even against vaccination, than parents of older children. Finally, the worry about consequences of COVID-19 infection on children's health facilitated vaccine adherence. These findings contribute to deepening mechanisms regarding the vaccine acceptability.

"Knowledge of Teenagers and Young Adults about COVID-19 and Compliance with Social Distancing Guidelines","Understanding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) knowledge and personal preventive behaviors of younger individuals is important as it can affect not only their own health but also the health of other potentially more vulnerable individuals. The aims of this study were to explore the knowledge of teenagers and young adults about COVID-19 and assess their personal preventive behavior. We developed a 14-item questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional online survey. Survey responses with missing variables were excluded. SPSS was used to perform the analyses, including descriptive statistics. Thirty-five participants, 15 to 27 years of age, completed the survey between May 2020 and March 2021. Thirty-one (88.57%) reported feeling sufficiently informed to avoid the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The most frequent sources of COVID-19 information were social media (68.6%) and parents (68.6%), whereas the least were teachers (11.4%). Thirty-three (94.29%) participants reported practicing social distancing, citing the main reasons to keep oneself, family members, and others safe. Thirty-three (94.29%) identified taking classes online instead of going to school as an example of social distancing, 26 (74.29%) calling friends on the telephone, and 24 (68.57%) going on a walk alone. Twelve (34.29%) chose eating infected foods and 8 (22.86%) touching animals, including pets, as transmission means for COVID-19. When asked about COVID-19 prevention, 34 (97.14%) reported that COVID-19 can be prevented by avoiding close contact with people who are sick, 31 (88.57%) by covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue, and 8 (22.86%) by avoiding contact with animals, including pets. We found high awareness of COVID-19, but also identified important knowledge gaps about COVID-19 and preventive measures. Digital platforms and social media campaigns can be important sources for providing evidence-based and age-appropriate information about COVID-19 and recommendations for safe activities to reduce social isolation during the pandemic and its negative mental health effects. This study also suggests that teachers may be an underused source of accurate information about COVID-19. These findings can be used to develop effective educational interventions to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on young individuals.","Sattari, Kazory, Kazory, Sattari","https://doi.org/10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001449","20221003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38615,""
"Forgone Care among LGBTQ and Non-LGBTQ Americans during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Health, Social Support, and Pandemic-Related Stress","In this study, we explore the role of Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic-related stress, social support, and health on unmet healthcare needs during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, particularly among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer plus (LGBTQ+) adults. We collected data using a self-administered online survey of US adults. Using logistic regression, we modeled potential risk and protective factors for not receiving needed care during the pandemic (forgone care) among LGBTQ+ individuals (n <i>=</i> 121), cisgender and heterosexual-identifying women (n = 235), and cisgender and heterosexual-identifying men (n <i>=</i> 62). Limiting analyses to the LGBTQ+ subsample, we also assessed the unique role of LGBTQ+ discrimination and depressive symptoms. Logistic regression results suggested that social support was associated with lower odds of forgone care (odds ratio [OR] 0.95, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.01). Furthermore, better self-rated health and higher levels of income were associated with lower odds of forgone care (OR 0.56, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.001, and OR 0.92, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.05, respectively). Finally, LGBTQ+ individuals experienced uniquely high levels of forgone care, and LGBTQ+ discrimination (OR 1.03, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.05) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.09, <i>P &lt;</i> 0.01) were associated with higher odds of forgone care among LGBTQ+ participants. Future research should examine the unique factors shaping the access to health care of LGBTQ+ adults in the United States, and healthcare practitioners should consider strategies to screen for discrimination and leverage the protective benefits of social support.","Tabler, Schmitz, Charak, Propst","https://doi.org/10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001456","20221003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38616,""
"Home-based respiratory muscle training on quality of life and exercise tolerance in long-term post-COVID-19: Randomized controlled trial","To evaluate the effects of a home-based respiratory muscle training programme (inspiratory [IMT] or inspiratory/expiratory muscles [RMT]) supervised by telerehabilitation on quality of life and exercise tolerance in individuals with long-term post-COVID-19 symptoms. The secondary objective was to evaluate the effects of these programmes on respiratory muscle function, physical and lung function, and psychological state. 88 individuals with long-term symptoms of fatigue and dyspnoea after COVID-19 diagnosis were randomly (1:1 ratio) assigned to IMT, IMT<sub>sham</sub>, RMT or RMT<sub>sham</sub> groups for an 8-week intervention (40min/day, 6 times/week). Primary outcomes were quality of life (EuroQol-5D questionnaire) and exercise tolerance (Ruffier test). Secondary outcomes were respiratory muscle function (inspiratory/expiratory muscle strength; inspiratory muscle endurance), physical function (lower and upper limb strength [1-min Sit-to-Stand and handgrip force]), lung function (forced spirometry), and psychological status (anxiety/depression levels and post-traumatic stress disorder). All outcomes were measured pre-, intermediate- (4th week), and post-intervention. At post-intervention, there was a statistically significant and large (d&gt;0.90) improvement in quality of life, but not in exercise tolerance, in the RMT group compared with the RMT<sub>sham</sub> group. Both of the real training groups produced a statistically significant and large increase in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance (dÃ¢â€°Â¥0.80) and in lower limb muscle strength (dÃ¢â€°Â¥0.77) compared with the 2 sham groups. Expiratory muscle strength and peak expiratory flow showed a statistically significant and large (dÃ¢â€°Â¥0.87) increase in the RMT group compared with the other 3 groups. Only an 8-week supervised home-based RMT programme was effective in improving quality of life, but not exercise tolerance, in individuals with long-term post-COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, IMT and RMT programmes were effective in improving respiratory muscle function and lower limb muscle strength, but had no impact on lung function and psychological status.","Del Corral, Garrido, Plaza-Manzano, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-de-Las-PeÃƒÂ±as, Navarro-Santana, LÃƒÂ³pez-de-Uralde-Villanueva","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rehab.2022.101709","20221003","Maximal; Respiratory Pressures; Respiratory muscle training; SARS-CoV-2; quality of life; telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38617,""
"Prevalence of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms twelve months after hospitalisation in participants retained in follow-up: analyses stratified by gender from a large prospective cohort","Persistent post-acute COVID-19 symptom (PACS) have been reported up to 6-months (M6) after hospital discharge. Here we assessed, in the longitudinal prospective national French COVID cohort, symptoms that persisted 12-months (M12) after admission for COVID-19. Hospitalized patients with a virologically-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Follow-up was planned until M12 post-admission. Associations between persistence of Ã¢â€°Â¥3 PACS at M12 and clinical characteristics at admission were assessed through logistic regression according to gender. We focused on participants enrolled between January 24<sup>th</sup> and July 15<sup>th</sup> 2020, in order to allow M12 follow-up. M12 data were available for 737 participants. Median age was 61Ã‚Â years, 475 (64%) were men and 242/647 (37%) were admitted to ICU during the acute phase. At M12, 194/710 (27%) of participants had Ã¢â€°Â¥3 persistent PACS, mostly fatigue, dyspnea and joint pain. Among those who had a professional occupation before the acute phase 91/339 (27%) were still on sick leave at M12. Presence of Ã¢â€°Â¥3 persistent PACS was associated with female gender, both anxiety and depression, impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL) and mMRC scale &lt;57.

"Longitudinal impact of the COVID19 pandemic on mental health in a general population sample in France: Evidence from the COMET Study","To study the longitudinal impact of co-occurring mental health problems, and to identify vulnerable groups in need of mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were based on data from 681 French participants in the international COVID-19 Mental Health Study, collected at four times (05/2020-04/2021). Symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the PTSD Check List for DSM-5. We performed latent growth mixture modeling to build trajectories of adults' depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms and identify subgroups psychologically vulnerable. We then assessed whether mental health trajectories were predicted by lockdown regulations. A high and a low cluster of mental health scores were identified. In both groups, mental health scores varied significantly across time. Levels of all mental health scores were lowest when COVID-19-related restrictions were lifted and highest when restrictions were in place, except for PTSD. No scores returned to the previous level or the initial level of mental health (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05). Participants with high levels of symptoms were characterized by younger age (OR: 0.98, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 0.97-0.99), prior history of mental disorders (OR: 3.46, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 2.07-5.82), experience of domestic violence (OR: 10.54, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.54-20.68) and medical issues (OR: 2.16, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.14-4.03).

"The relations between emotion regulation, depression and anxiety among medical staff during the late stage of COVID-19 pandemic: a network analysis","Existing research proposed that moving from a disorder-level analysis to a symptom-level analysis may provide a more fine-grained understanding of psychopathology. This study aimed to explore the relations between two dimensions (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, CR; expressive suppression, ES) of emotion regulation and individual symptoms of depression and anxiety among medical staff during the late stage of COVID-19 pandemic. We examined depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation among 420 medical staff during the late stage of COVID-19 pandemic via network analysis. Two networks (i.e. emotion regulation-depression network and emotion regulation-anxiety network) were constructed in the present study. Bridge centrality index was calculated for each variable within the two networks. Among the present sample, the prevalences of depression and anxiety are 39.5% and 26.0%. CR and ES showed distinct connections to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results of bridge centrality showed that in both networks, CR had a negative bridge expected influence value while ES had a positive bridge expected influence value. The results revealed the specific role of CR and ES in relation to depression and anxiety at a symptom level.

"Exploring seizure management in hospitals, unmet need, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seizure presentations to hospital","This study assesses investigations, referrals and admissions in patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with seizures, and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on such management. Outcomes in patients with learning disabilities, active significant mental health concerns, and from the most socioeconomically deprived areas were compared to those of the general cohort. Investigations, referrals and admissions were recorded for 120 patients across two cohorts; pre-pandemic (September 2019) and during the pandemic (December 2020). Retrospective review of individual patient electronic health care records was used for data collection. There was a decrease in patient numbers from 2019 to 2020. A greater proportion of patients presented with organic cause seizures and fewer presented with non-epileptic attacks. Frequent use of CT heads (45%) is likely to represent improper use of limited resources. There were low referral rates, both to acute neurology (28%) and to the adult epilepsy team (32%). Patients with active significant mental health concerns were significantly less likely to be referred to neurology or admitted. Despite a greater proportion of admissions during the Covid-19 pandemic, referrals to acute neurology and the epilepsy team remained low. Failure to refer prevents the most vulnerable seizure patients from receiving appropriate support, as seen in patients with active significant mental health concerns. Neurology staff were unaware of a significant number of patients presenting with seizures, which is of concern in an already over-stretched department. This offers an opportunity to improve care for people with epilepsy.","Ellis, Chilcott, John, Parry, Capeling, Lawthom, Harding, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2022.09.014","20221003","COVID-19; Emergency department; Epilepsy; Pandemic; Seizure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38621,""
"Postnatal depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: The needs and experiences of New Zealand mothers and health care providers","The postnatal period is a vulnerable time for women's mental health, particularly within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study interviewed Auckland-based mothers and healthcare providers to find out their perspectives on the needs and experiences of women with postnatal mental health concerns within the pandemic context. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via video conferencing. Interviews were conducted between May and July 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included eight mothers who gave birth during the first year of the pandemic (between January and December 2020) and self-identified as experiencing postnatal depression and/or anxiety, and three healthcare providers who support women with postnatal mental illness. All participants were based in Auckland, New Zealand. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Five main themes were identified including (1) uncertainty and anxiety, (2) financial and work stress, (3) importance of the ""village"", (4) inner resilience, and (5) ""no one cared for mum"". The participants' stories reflected a period of uncertainty, anxiety, and isolation. A lack of focus on mothers' mental health during postnatal healthcare appointments was evident, as well as a lack of support services to refer the women to should they reach out for help. The results of this study highlight the importance of prioritising safe, in-person access to healthcare providers and sources of social support for postnatal women during pandemic lockdowns to help reduce isolation during this vulnerable time. Improving accessibility to a range of treatment options for those with mild to moderate mental illness also needs to be a priority. A dedicated postnatal mental health support line could be beneficial to broaden the support options available to mothers, both within and outside the pandemic context. More focus on mental health training for midwives and other postnatal healthcare providers such as well child nurses is also recommended, to increase their ability to support women struggling with postnatal mental illness.","Ryan, Barber","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2022.103491","20221003","COVID-19 pandemic; Maternal mental health; Perinatal mental health; Postnatal anxiety; Postnatal depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38622,""
"Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social isolation and mental health in people with MS","People with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) as various factors important to their functioning and quality of life are at-risk and/or compromised during the pandemic. In particular, the social distancing and quarantine practice during the pandemic maybe detrimental to MS patients' social and emotional health. Compared with the general population, MS patients may be under increased social strain and suffer worse health consequences from social isolation. To date, there has been no research examining the social consequences of the pandemic on MS patients' emotional and social health. This is a retrospective longitudinal study of 266 adults with MS who were followed at a large academic medical center in the Midwest. Each participant completed monthly surveys including depression, anxiety, and social health variables. T-Tests shows worse anxiety (95% CI [-5.03, -3.05]; p-valueÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), worse depression (95% CI [-2.67, -1.03]; p-valueÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), and worse satisfaction with social roles (95% CI [2.37, 3.95]; p-valueÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) since the COVID-19 outbreak (March 2020). Social isolation is associated with worse anxiety (95% CI [-8.98, -4.58]; p-valueÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and depression (95% CI [-6.88, -3.24]; p-valueÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). However, individuals who had in-person visits before and after the outbreak did not experience any changes in anxiety, depression, or social health.

"Nurse scheduling in COVID-19 designated hospitals in China: A nationwide cross-sectional survey","Hospitals are at the forefront of COVID-19 prevention and control, and nurses are the main force on the frontline of the epidemic. Nursing shift is one of the most relevant and pressing issues for front-line nurses. However, there is a lack of national, large-sample surveys on scheduling and adverse nursing outcomes in COVID-19 designated hospitals. To investigate scheduling in COVID-19-designated hospitals, including working hours, rest days, adverse nursing outcomes and their relationship. Using a cross-sectional online survey, we used nurse-reported data to measure the characteristics of the work setting, samples and work schedule. A descriptive analysis was performed to assess the shift status and adverse outcomes of designated hospitals and frontline nurses. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between them. Basic data were collected from 217 departments of 69 COVID-19 designated hospitals in 31 provinces in China. Nurses in the severe isolation ward worked mainly for 4 h/shift, while those in the fever clinic and observation ward worked mainly for 6-8 h. Half of the nurses had only one day of rest per week. Long working hours, lack of adequate rest time, and overtime can seriously affect the quality and safety of nurses' work, resulting in adverse outcomes. Frontline nurses hope that scheduling guarantees the time to rest while ensuring fairness. The current evidence showed that frontline nurses were faced with long working hours, insufficient rest, and overtime, which has a negative impact on nurse satisfaction, physical and mental health, and quality of care. The government, hospitals, and administrators still face many problems to overcome in their nursing schedules. Governments and hospitals should take these factors, such as the work setting characteristics and demographic features of the frontline nurses, into account when selecting nurses to fight COVID-19. Nurses have different working hours in different types of coronavirus unit , therefore, nursing managers should consider the working environment and nursing schedule needs, and in the future, we should pay attention to the fairness of nurses while ensuring their rest.","Liu, Wang, Jiang, Ren, Yu, Cun, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13832","20221003","COVID-19; Nursing scheduling; adverse nurse outcomes; designated hospital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38624,""
"Effectiveness of Mental Health Apps for Distress during COVID-19 in US Unemployed and Essential Workers: A Remote Pragmatic Clinical Trial","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general public was concerned about the mental health impacts of unemployment due to COVID and the stress essential workers experienced during this time. Several reports indicated that people in distress were turning to digital technology, but there was very little evidence about the impact of these tools on mitigating distress. This study sought to determine the acceptability, feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of mobile mental health apps for decreasing mental health symptoms in essential workers and unemployed individuals with suicide risk. We recruited participants who indicated that they were unemployed because of COVID-19 or were COVID-19 designated essential workers. Participants were randomized to one of four free commercial mobile applications for managing distress that were (1) highly rated by PsyberGuide and (2) met criteria for intervention features these participants indicated were desirable in a previous survey. Participants used the apps for 4 weeks and completed baseline and 4-week self-assessments of depression, anxiety emotional regulation and suicide risk. We found no differences between the apps in any outcome but did find significant changes in depression and anxiety over time (PHQ9: estimate= -1.5, SE 0.2, 95% CI -1.1--1.8; P &lt; .001; GAD-7: estimate= -1.3, SE 0.2; 95% CI -1.0--1.6; P &lt; .001). We found no significant changes in suicidal behavior (SBQ-R) or emotional regulation (DERS-SF) for the 4 weeks. We did find a significant dose-response pattern for changes in depression and anxiety. Using the app at least once a week resulted in greater improvements in treatment conditions over time on depression (estimate = -0.6; SE 0.2; 95% CI 1.0--0.2; P = .003) and anxiety (estimate= 0.1; SE 0.2; 95% CI 0.4-0.6; P = .78). There was no association between app frequency and changes in suicidal behavior (SBQ-R) or emotional regulation (DERS-SF). We further found a significant difference between the conditions with regard to app usability, with the control app being the most usable (mean(Beautiful Mood) 72.9, SD 16.7; mean(Covid Coach) 71.2, SD 15.4; mean(Calm) 66.8, SD 17.3; mean(7 Cups) 65.2, SD 17.7). We found no significant differences on app acceptability or appropriateness. Few studies evaluate prospectively the utility and usability of commercial apps for mood. This study finds that free, self-guided commercial mobile mental health apps are seen as usable, but no one app is superior to the other. Although we found that regular use is indicated for effects on depression and anxiety to occur in those who are more symptomatic, regression to the mean cannot be ruled out.

"Determinants of e-mental Health Use during COVID-19: Findings from a Cross-sectional Canadian Study","Access to mental health treatment across Canada remains a challenge, with many reporting unmet care needs. National and provincial e-mental health programs have been developed over the past decade across Canada, with many more emerging during COVID-19 in an attempt to reduce barriers related to geography, isolation, transportation, physical disability and availability. This study aims to identify factors associated with the utilization of e-mental health services across Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic using Andersen and Newman's framework of health service utilization. This study uses data gathered from the 2021 Canadian Digital Health Survey - a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 12,052 Canadians aged 16 years and older with Internet access. Bivariate associations between the use of e-mental health services and health service utilization factors (predisposing, enabling, illness level) of survey respondents were assessed using Ãâ€¡2 tests for categorical variables and t-test for the continuous variable. Logistic regression was used to predict the probability of using e-mental health services given the respondents' predisposing, enabling, and illness level factors while adjusting for respondents' age and gender. The proportion of e-mental health service users among survey respondents was small (883 out of 12,052). Results from the logistic regression suggest that users of e-mental health services were likely to be those with regular family physician access (OR=1.57, P=.02), living in non-rural communities (OR =1.08, P=.0005), having undergraduate (OR1.40, P=.0013) or post-graduate (OR=1.48, P=.0033) education, eHealth literate (OR= 1.05, P&lt;0.0001). Those with lower e-mental health usage were less likely to speak English at home (OR=.056, P &lt;.0001). Our study provides empirical evidence on the impact of individual health utilization factors on the use of e-mental health among Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the opportunities and promise of e-mental health services in increasing access to care, future digital interventions should both tailor themselves towards users of these services and consider awareness campaigns to reach non-users. Future research should also focus on understanding the reasons behind the use and non-use of e-mental health services.","Yu, Xu, Sequeira","https://doi.org/10.2196/39662","20221003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38626,""
"Tracking the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policy on public mental health using social media: an infoveillance study","The COVID-19 pandemic and its corresponding preventive and control measures have increased the mental burden on the public. Understanding and tracking changes in public mental status can facilitate optimizing public mental health intervention and control strategies. To build a social media-based pipeline that tracks public mental changes and use it to understand public mental health status regarding the pandemic. This study used COVID-19-related tweets posted between February 2020 to April 2022. The tweets were downloaded using unique identifiers through the Twitter application programming interface. We created a lexicon of four mental health problems (depression, anxiety, insomnia, and addiction) to identify mental health-related tweets and developed a dictionary for identifying healthcare workers. We analyzed temporal and geographical distributions of public mental health status during the pandemic and further compared distributions among healthcare workers versus the general public, supplemented by topic modeling on their underlying foci. Finally, we used interrupted time series to examine the state-wide impact of lockdown policy on public mental health in 12 states. We extracted 4,213,005 tweets related to mental health and COVID-19 from 2,316,817 users. 2,161,357 (51.30%) of the tweets were related to ""depression"", while 1,923,635 (45.66%), 225,205 (5.35%) and 150,006 (3.56%) were related to ""anxiety"", ""insomnia"", and ""addiction"", respectively. Compared to the general public, healthcare workers had higher risks of all four types of problems (all P&lt;.001), and they concerned more about clinical topics than everyday issues (e.g., ""students' pressure"", ""panic buying"" and ""fuel problems"") than the general public. Finally, the lockdown policy had significant associations with public mental health in 4 out of the 12 states we studied, among which Pennsylvania showed a positive association, while Michigan, North Carolina, and Ohio showed the opposite (all P&lt;.05). The impact of COVID-19 and corresponding control measures on the public's mental status is dynamic and shows variability among different cohorts regarding disease types, occupations, and regional groups. Health agencies and policymakers should primarily focus on depression (reported by 51.30% of the tweets) and insomnia (had an ever-increasing trend since the beginning of the pandemic), especially among healthcare workers. Our pipeline timely tracks and analyzes public mental health changes, especially when primary studies and large-scale surveys are hard to conduct.","Li, Hua, Liao, Zhou, Li, Wang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.2196/39676","20221003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38627,""
"Associations between COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and the experience of violence among women and girls living with and at risk of HIV in Nigeria","<b><i>Aim</i></b>: Women and girls living with and at high risk of HIV (WGL&amp;RHIV) had an increased risk for gender-based violence (GBV) during COVID-19. The study aimed to assess the associations between vaccine hesitancy and GBV, HIV status and psychological distress among these vulnerable women and girls in Nigeria.<b><i>Methods:</i></b> This cross-sectional study collected data from WGL&amp;RHIV in 10 states in Nigeria between June and October 2021. The dependent variable was vaccine hesitancy. The independent variables were the experience of physical, sexual, economic and emotional GBV, HIV status and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a multivariable logistics regression analysis to test the associations between vaccine hesitancy and the independent variables and covariates.<b><i>Results:</i></b> Among the 3 431 participants, 1 015 (22.8%) were not willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Not knowing or willing to disclose HIV status (aOR 1.40) and having mild (aOR 1.36) and moderate (aOR 1.38) symptoms of anxiety and depression were significantly associated with higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Being a survivor of intimate partner physical violence (aOR 5.76), non-intimate partner sexual violence (aOR 3.41), as well as emotional abuse (aOR 1.55) were significantly associated with respectively more than five, three and one and half times higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. One positive outcome is that HIV-positive women and girls appeared to be more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine when available.<b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Sexual and gender-based violence, low socio-economic status, psychological distress and an unknown HIV status are essential determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among vulnerable women and girls in Nigeria. National authorities and civil society organisations need to better integrate COVID-19 mitigation activities with HIV and gender-based violence interventions through a more feminist approach that promotes gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity for better access to health services.","Folayan, Arije, Enemo, Sunday, Muhammad, Nyako, Abdullah, Okiwu, Lamontagne","https://doi.org/10.2989/16085906.2022.2118615","20221003","gender-based violence; intimate partner violence; psychological distress; sexual violence; women empowerment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38628,""
"The effects of COVID-19 on food insecurity, financial vulnerability and housing insecurity among women and girls living with or at risk of HIV in Nigeria","<b><i>Aim</i></b>: Women and girls living with or at high risk of acquiring HIV (WGL&amp;RHIV) in Africa are economically vulnerable. This study aims to advance understanding of the economic impact of COVID-19 on WGL&amp;RHIV and to identify the factors associated with this insecurity.<b><i>Methods:</i></b> Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted among a convenience sample of WGL&amp;RHIV in Nigeria between May and September 2021. Logistic regressions enabled the study of the role of HIV status, mental health and macrosocial characteristics (people with disability, transgender women, sex workers, persons engaged in transactional sex, substance users, and people on the move) on economic vulnerability, measured by food, financial and housing insecurity, since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The model accounted for the possible interactions between the macrosocial characteristics and controlled for confounders.<b><i>Results:</i></b> There were 3 313 (76.1%) of 4 355 respondents facing food insecurity, 3 664 (83.6%) of 4 385 with financial vulnerability and 1 282 (36.2%) of 3 544 with housing insecurity. Being a member of the key and vulnerable groups was strongly associated with food insecurity, financial vulnerability and housing insecurity, regardless of HIV serostatus. For example, WGL&amp;RHIV engaging in transactional sex were more than four times more likely (aOR 4.42; 95% CI 2.57-7.59) to face housing insecurity and more than twice more likely to face food insecurity (aOR 2.47, 95% CI 1.35-4.52) and financial vulnerability (aOR 2.87, 95% CI 1.39-5.93). This economic vulnerability may reduce their negotiating power for safer sex or the use of HIV prevention methods, exposing them to increased risks of HIV infection. Poor mental health was also associated with the three forms of economic vulnerability.<b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> As the long-term impact of the COVID-19 crisis on African economies unfolds, HIV programmes at the country level must include economic vulnerability and mental unwellness mitigation activities for WGL&amp;RHIV.","Lamontagne, Folayan, Arije, Enemo, Sunday, Muhammad, Nyako, Abdullah, Okiwu, Undelikwo, Ogbozor, Amusan, Alaba","https://doi.org/10.2989/16085906.2022.2113107","20221003","COVID-19; HIV; economic impact; sex work; transgender people; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38629,""

"A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of an Online Educational Program for Primiparous Women to Improve Breastfeeding","There are different approaches to breastfeeding interventions, but the global 6-month exclusive breastfeeding rates remain suboptimal. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought extra difficulties in promoting breastfeeding. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of a theory-based, real-time online educational and support program for breastfeeding related outcomes. An assessor-blinded, prospective pilot randomized controlled trial with parallel-group, repeated-measures design was used. The sample was low-risk primiparous mothers (<i>N</i> = 40) who delivered in the local public hospitals. Study outcomes consisted of exclusive breastfeeding rate, breastfeeding self-efficacy, and other breastfeeding outcomes measured by a self-reported questionnaire, including the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Comparisons between the differences in the intervention and control groups were carried out. Thirteen participants in the intervention group successfully completed the program. They had a higher exclusive breastfeeding rate, breastfeeding self-efficacy, breastfeeding initiation rate, and longer exclusive breastfeeding duration than the control group. Additionally, the intervention group had a lower partial breastfeeding rate, and a higher maternal postnatal depression score and infant's morbidity at postnatal 2 months. However, all the results were not statistically significant (<i>p</i> &gt; .050). Overall, the intervention was highly valued by all participants who appreciated the regular postnatal follow-ups. Despite showing the satisfactory feasibility of the program, no significant improvements were found in all study outcomes.

"Impact of Online Group Psychoeducation and Support Sessions on Receptivity Towards Digital Mental Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study","While social distancing was crucial to slow the COVID-19 virus, it also contributed to social isolation and emotional strain. This pilot study evaluated the impact of stand-alone psychoeducational group sessions designed to build social connectedness and space for people to learn about mental health during the pandemic. The study examined if offering the stand-alone group sessions increased uptake of and receptivity to additional mental health services. People had access to free, online group psychoeducational sessions offered by a digital mental health platform company. Sessions were offered to (1) employees who had mental health benefits offered through their employer, and to (2) members of the general public. Session formats included discussions, didactic lectures, and workshops, were facilitated by a mental health provider, and used live video conference technology. Topics included race and identity, stress management, coping with political events, relationship issues, and self-compassion. First-time session registrations were tracked from June 2020 to July 2021 on 6723 participants (3717 benefits-eligible employees and 3006 from the general public). Among the employee subsample, 49.5% attended a group session as their first use of any available service on the platform; 52.5% of these employees sought additional services after their first session. In anonymous post-session surveys of employees and members of the general public, 86% of respondents endorsed knowledge increases, 79.5% reported improved understanding of their mental health, 80.3% endorsed gaining actionable steps to improve mental health, 76.5% said that they would consider group sessions in addition to therapy, and 43.5% said that they would consider group sessions instead of therapy.

"Personal and work-related factors associated with mental health among auto workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","Little is known about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-healthcare workers, especially among those who weathered unemployment related to shutdowns and supply-chain disruptions. We administered a cross-sectional survey (May - October 2021) to understand patterns between personal and work-related predictors and mental health symptoms among in-person auto workers in the United States (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,165). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 measured the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Predictors included the presence of financial/family stressors, fear of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, perceptions of safety climate/culture, and clarity of workplace COVID-19 protocols. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine associations between the predictors and anxiety symptoms alone, depressive symptoms alone, and both anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to no symptoms, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, employee type, COVID-19 infection history, and preexisting psychological or psychiatric disorders. Experiencing financial/family stressors (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.65, 95Ã‚Â % CI: 1.86-3.78) and feeling very concerned over SARS-CoV-2 exposure (AOR: 2.12, 95Ã‚Â % CI: 1.47-3.06) increased the odds of having both anxiety and depressive symptoms in comparison to experiencing no stressors, and feeling less than very concerned over exposure, respectively. Positive perceptions of safety climate/culture (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.79, 95Ã‚Â % CI: 0.75-0.84) and strong clarity of COVID-19 protocols (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.91, 95Ã‚Â %CI: 0.84-0.99) were associated with lower odds of both anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Regarding specific coping strategies, planning had the highest mean score (5.15Ã‚Â±1.31), followed by acceptance (4.95Ã‚Â±1.34), religion (4.56Ã‚Â±1.52), and positive reframing (4.28Ã‚Â±1.89), while substance use (0.01Ã‚Â±0.19) was the least reported followed by humor (0.86Ã‚Â±1.43), denial (0.97Ã‚Â±1.56), and behavioral disengagement (1.02Ã‚Â±1.60). Associations were observed between the different coping strategies and participants' gender, age, marital status, exercise level, and stress level (<sup>p</sup> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05). During a large-scale pandemic, the psychological impact on the general population is significant, even among individuals not infected with the disease. These results underscore the need for a mental health support system in Oman that can address the general population's needs. Public education on coping strategies and stress management may be helpful.","Al Kindi, Ambusaidi, Al Mahrooqi, Al Omrani, Al Jabri, Al Sumri","https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2022.84","20221003","COVID-19; Coping Behaviors; Mental Health; Oman; Pandemic; Psychological Distress; Psychological Stress; Quality of Life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38637,""
"Characteristics of Admissions to a Tertiary Psychiatric Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Observational Study","To study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the socio-demographic and clinical profiles of patients who were admitted to a tertiary psychiatric hospital in the UAE during 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019, and to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on the mental healthcare system. Socio-demographic and clinical data of the patients from March 11 to June 11 in 2019 and 2020 was collected anonymously from hospital electronic medical records. The characteristics of the two patient cohorts were compared statistically. A total of 337 patient admissions to the hospital during March 11 to June 11, 2020 against 189 admissions in the corresponding period in 2019. In the multiple logistic regression model, the admissions in 2020 were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 1.902; <i>p =</i>0.028) and were significantly to have no prior psychiatric history (OR = 4.255, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), compared to those cases admitted in 2019. This study is unique for evaluating the patterns of hospitalization at a specific psychiatric hospital during the first three months of the pandemic in the UAE. The findings of this study will support the public health sector in designing mental health strategies in pandemic situations. A longitudinal multicenter study would give more insight into the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health.","Qamruddin, Bsaibes, Yanni, Skaria, Sabri, Itani, Turki","https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2022.83","20221003","Bipolar Disorder; COVID-19; Mental Health; Psychiatry; Psychology; United Arab Emirates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38638,""
"A Scoping Review of Barriers and Facilitators Affecting the Lives of People With Disabilities During COVID-19","This scoping review aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators to everyday activities and social participation of people with a disability (PWD) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The search terms (disability and COVID-19) were used in four databases: CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE and Web of Science. The search conducted from January 2019 to September 22, 2020, identified 465 peer reviewed articles and abstracts and were screened in Covidence software. Studies were included if they had the terms ""COVID-19"" and ""disability,"" were published in English, and specifically examined how COVID-19 impacted the daily lives of PWD. Exclusion criteria included: disability as a symptom or result of COVID-19, the health outcomes when PWD acquired COVID-19, disability leave for someone who is sick and the risk of acquiring the disease for PWD. 74 articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed via data charting. Charting began with existing barriers and facilitators identified by the World Health Organization and new barriers and facilitators, that emerged from the texts were added during this process. The barriers that emerged included: access to information, ease of communication, financial impacts, mental health impacts, access to essential services, physical safety, educational challenges, and changes to care and rehabilitation. Significant facilitators included: changes to care and rehabilitation, new innovations, social and familial support and inclusive policy measures. COVID-19 exacerbated existing challenges in the lives of PWD and raised new quality of life concerns. Findings also demonstrate that policy makers, health care professionals and others continually support PWD in times of crisis.","Croft, Fraser","https://doi.org/10.3389/fresc.2021.784450","20221003","COVID-19; barriers; disability; facilitators; inclusivity; pandemic; rehabilitation; social participation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38639,""

"The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on cause-specific mortality patterns: a systematic literature review","Understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cause-specific mortality should be a priority, as this metric allows for a detailed analysis of the true burden of the pandemic. The aim of this systematic literature review is to estimate the impact of the pandemic on different causes of death, providing a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the phenomenon. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and ProQuest for studies that reported cause-specific mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, extracting relevant data. A total of 2413 articles were retrieved, and after screening 22 were selected for data extraction. Cause-specific mortality results were reported using different units of measurement. The most frequently analyzed cause of death was cardiovascular diseases (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 16), followed by cancer (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 14) and diabetes (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 11). We reported heterogeneous patterns of cause-specific mortality, except for suicide and road accident. Evidence on non-COVID-19 cause-specific deaths is not exhaustive. Reliable scientific evidence is needed by policymakers to make the best decisions in an unprecedented and extremely uncertain historical period.

"The Pandemic Experience for People with Depressive Symptoms: Substance Use, Finances, Access to Treatment, and Trusted Sources of Information","Mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are well recognized, but little is known about the pandemic experience among people experiencing mental health symptoms. In June 2020, a national sample of 5023 U.S. adults, including 785 scoring Ã¢Â©Â¾10 on the PHQ-8 for symptoms of depression, completed survey measures related to their pandemic experience. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic experience for which participants scoring PHQ-8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Â©Â¾Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 had the greatest increase in odds of reporting moderate/severe negative impacts included: mental health treatment access (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.81, 6.70-11.57), family stress/discord (OR, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.21, 4.24-6.42), food access (OR, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.76, 2.97-4.77), and income/employment (OR, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.19, 2.66-3.83).

The interplay among depressive symptoms, substance use, lack of trust in healthcare authorities, and negative impact of the pandemic on family, finances, and access to mental health treatment and food indicate the need for robust social and behavioral health safety nets to buffer communities from the shadow epidemics of depression, family violence, and overdose deaths during public health disasters.","Sanchez, da Graca, Hall, Bennett, Powers, Warren","https://doi.org/10.1177/11782218221126973","20221003","Depression; access to treatment; pandemic; substance use; trusted sources","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38642,""
"Emotions and Incivility in Vaccine Mandate Discourse: Natural Language Processing Insights","Despite vaccine availability, vaccine hesitancy has inhibited public health officials' efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Although some US elected officials have responded by issuing vaccine mandates, others have amplified vaccine hesitancy by broadcasting messages that minimize vaccine efficacy. The politically polarized nature of COVID-19 information on social media has given rise to incivility, wherein health attitudes often hinge more on political ideology than science. To the best of our knowledge, incivility has not been studied in the context of discourse regarding COVID-19 vaccines and mandates. Specifically, there is little focus on the psychological processes that elicit uncivil vaccine discourse and behaviors. Thus, we investigated 3 psychological processes theorized to predict discourse incivility-namely, anxiety, anger, and sadness. We used 2 different natural language processing approaches: (1) the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count computational tool and (2) the Google Perspective application programming interface (API) to analyze a data set of 8014 tweets containing terms related to COVID-19 vaccine mandates from September 14, 2021, to October 1, 2021. To collect the tweets, we used the Twitter API Tweet Downloader Tool (version 2). Subsequently, we filtered through a data set of 375,000 vaccine-related tweets using keywords to extract tweets explicitly focused on vaccine mandates. We relied on the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count computational tool to measure the valence of linguistic anger, sadness, and anxiety in the tweets. To measure dimensions of post incivility, we used the Google Perspective API. This study resolved discrepant operationalizations of incivility by introducing incivility as a multifaceted construct and explored the distinct emotional processes underlying 5 dimensions of discourse incivility. The findings revealed that 3 types of emotions-anxiety, anger, and sadness-were uniquely associated with dimensions of incivility (eg, toxicity, severe toxicity, insult, profanity, threat, and identity attacks). Specifically, the results showed that anger was significantly positively associated with all dimensions of incivility (all <i>P</i>&lt;.001), whereas sadness was significantly positively related to threat (<i>P</i>=.04). Conversely, anxiety was significantly negatively associated with identity attack (<i>P</i>=.03) and profanity (<i>P</i>=.02). The results suggest that our multidimensional approach to incivility is a promising alternative to understanding and intervening in the psychological processes underlying uncivil vaccine discourse. Understanding specific emotions that can increase or decrease incivility such as anxiety, anger, and sadness can enable researchers and public health professionals to develop effective interventions against uncivil vaccine discourse. Given the need for real-time monitoring and automated responses to the spread of health information and misinformation on the web, social media platforms can harness the Google Perspective API to offer users immediate, automated feedback when it detects that a comment is uncivil.","Stevens, Rasul, Oh","https://doi.org/10.2196/37635","20221003","COVID-19; LIWC; Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count; Twitter; incivility; natural language processing; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine mandates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38643,""

"The impact of two types of COVID-19 discrimination and contemporaneous stressors on Chinese Immigrants in the US South","The global rise of the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an increase in anti-Asian discrimination with potentially deleterious effects on individuals of Asian descent. In the present study, we seek to determine associations among COVID-related anti-Asian discrimination, general COVID-19 stressors, acculturative stressors, and perceptions of stress as well as the role of ethnic identity in moderating how exposures to various forms of COVID-related discrimination affect stress in a population-representative sample of Chinese immigrants in North Carolina. Analyses rely on data collected among participants ages 18+ in the Chinese Immigrants in Raleigh-Durham (ChIRDU) study who completed surveys in 2018 and during the COVID-19 pandemic (July-September 2020). We utilize ordinary least squares regressions to examine associations of two types of COVID-related discrimination (measured by changes in perceptions of being feared by others and racism-related vigilance) and contemporaneous stressors with perceptions of stress by pre-pandemic ethnic identity. Controlling for sociodemographic predictors and other stressors, racism-related vigilance is significantly associated with higher perceived stress for Chinese immigrants who identify as completely Chinese. For those who identify as at least partly American, new perceptions of being feared by others during the pandemic are significantly associated with higher perceived stress. Acculturative and COVID-related stressors are independently associated with higher perceived stress for both groups. These results suggest that COVID-related anti-Asian discrimination aggravates the psychological burden of multiple stressors in Chinese immigrants' lives by uniquely contributing to perceptions of stress alongside contemporaneous stressors. The results also highlight the heterogeneous mental health needs of Chinese immigrants and hold important implications for intervention development in the community studied here as well in other Chinese communities in the US.","Stolte, Nagy, Zhan, Mouw, Merli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100159","20221003","Acculturative stress; COVID-19 stress; COVID-Related discrimination; Perceived stress; Psychological well-being; Racism-related vigilance; anti-Asian discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38645,""
"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 VACCINATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH","We examine the impact of vaccination against Covid-19 for mental health. Our estimates suggest that vaccination led to a significant and substantive improvement in mental health. These positive impacts were however concentrated on those most at risk of hospitalisation and death from Covid-19. Our proposed explanation is that in the absence of vaccination, anxiety about contracting COVID-19 has a deleterious impact on the mental health of this cohort. On the other hand, vaccination was much less impactful for the mental health of those least at risk from Covid-19. This may help to explain vaccine hesitancy amongst young people. For this group, a lack of uptake may be principally due to a lack of perceived benefits (and indeed perceived costs) for their own well-being as opposed to vaccine hesitancy.","Chaudhuri, Howley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2022.104293","20221003","covid-19; mental well-being; propensity score matching; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38646,""
"Supporting adolescents' mental health during COVID-19 by utilising lessons from the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake","Historical data can determine how adolescents recover from difficult situations such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study analysed 3 years of data obtained from high-school students who had been affected by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and consequently evidenced the importance of increasing resilience among affected adolescents. This involved identifying factors contributing to resilience through a model that assessed for each tsunami disaster. This model was determined by assessing the correlation between survivors' resilience scores and their measured psychological and lifestyle scores. This approach showed that, in all tsunami damage models, resilience was most affected by the depressed emotions. Thus, our approach suggests that interventions for improving the depressed mood may improve resilience in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Okuyama, Izumi, Funakoshi, Seto, Sasaki, Ito, Imamura, Willgerodt, Fukuda","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01330-1","20221003","Health humanities; Psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38647,""
"Burnout, negative emotions, and wellbeing among social workers in China after community lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic: Mediating roles of trait mindfulness","This study aimed to investigate burnout situation of social workers (SWs) who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic-related community lockdown 1 year before, and to assess the protective value of trait mindfulness (TM) in states of burnout. We surveyed the burnout, trait mindfulness, negative emotions (NEs) and wellbeing (WB) of 182 social workers provided services to Wuhan lockdowns community by COVID-19 one year before. Burnout were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey; TM using the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; NEs using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; and WB using the General Wellbeing Schedule. We also performed correlation regression analysis and mediation test for burnout, TM, NEs, and WB. Among the 182 respondents, 75 (41.2%) still suffered from severe burnout. TM was negatively correlated with burnout (r = -0.623), negatively correlated with NEs (r = -0.560), and positively correlated with WB (r = 0.617). Burnout had a significantly positive correlation with NEs (r = 0.544) and a significantly negative correlation with WB (r = -0.666). Further, WB had significantly negative correlation with NEs (r = -0.758). After controlling for age, gender, marital status, educational level, and years of employment, burnout had a significantly positive predictive effect on NEs (ÃŽÂ² = 0.509), whereas TM had a significantly negative predictive effect on NEs (ÃŽÂ² = -0.334). TM played a partial mediating role in the effect of burnout on NEs, with a mediating effect and effect ratio of 0.088 and 39.7%, respectively. Burnout had a significantly negative predictive effect on WB (ÃŽÂ² = -0.598), whereas TM had a significantly positive predictive effect on WB (ÃŽÂ² = 0.299). TM played a partial mediating role in the effect of burnout on NEs, with a mediating effect and effect ratio of -0.164 and 30.3%, respectively. WB had a significantly negative predictive effect on NEs (ÃŽÂ² = -0.711), and it played a partial mediating role in the effect of burnout on NEs, with a mediating effect and effect ratio of 0.185 and 83.3%, respectively. The current levels of burnout among local SWs remained high 1 year after the community lockdowns. TM played a mediating role in the relationship between burnout, NEs, and WB. Concomitantly, WB played a mediating role in the relationship between burnout and NEs. Therefore, in the context of burnout, TM is a protective factor for reducing emotional stress and risks of developing psychiatric disorders through the enhancement of WB.","Wu, Wei, Li, Pang, Su","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.952269","20221003","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; social workers; trait mindfulness; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38648,""
"Analysis model of college students' mental health based on online community topic mining and emotion analysis in novel coronavirus epidemic situation","Under the epidemic situation of COVID-19, university students have different levels of anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems, and these differing levels present different challenges. Therefore, universities and relevant departments should carry out accurate psychological health education for university students. Through research, this paper found that students' psychological problems during the COVID-19 epidemic were mainly reflected in four aspects: depression, interpersonal relationship, sleep and eating disorders, and compulsive behavior. Through the discussion of family of origin, self-awareness and motivation attribution, and social pressure, this paper analyzed the causes of psychological problems. The information resources of the network are usually unstructured data, and the text information, as the most typical unstructured data, occupies a large proportion. Moreover, this text information often contains users' emotional response to major events. In this paper, a data preprocessing system is designed, and three data preprocessing rules are defined: expression data conversion rules, data deduplication rules and invalid data cleaning rules. The characteristics of online community text data are analyzed, and the text feature extraction method is selected according to its characteristics. The results of this study show that the proportion of university students with psychological problems is about 23%, which is slightly higher than the research results during the non-epidemic period. This paper suggests that college students should master methods of self-regulation, improve their levels of physical exercise, improve their physical fitness, and establish and improve their defense mechanisms to alleviate psychological conflicts and pressures.","Lu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1000313","20221003","COVID-19 epidemic situation; online community; psychoanalysis; sentiment analysis; text data mining; university student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38649,""
"Behavioral compliance with preventive health measures for students with and without hearing disability during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Hearing loss affects over 1.5 billion individuals worldwide. Their disability and limited access to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic information make them suffer a greater degree than ordinary people. However, the quantitative studies on the implementation of behavior compliance with preventive health measures for vulnerable groups such as people with hearing disability were limited. The purpose of this study was to explore the compliance with pandemic-related protective health measures among people with hearing disability. A cross-sectional survey, population-based cohort study of students aged 12-26 years with and without hearing disability was conducted. Behavioral compliance with preventive health measures was collected from the general education institutions and special education schools using an online questionnaire. Logistic regression and structural equation model were used to determine the associations among the demographic variables, different degrees of mental health status and psychological impacts, and preventive health behaviors. Among 1,589 participants, 485 (30.5%) students are with hearing disability (SHD), and 1,104 (69.5%) students with normal hearing (SNH). The SHD has a significantly lower degree of behavioral compliance with the preventive health measures than SNH has. Hearing disability and anxiety [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54-1.76, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05] are risk factors for avoiding sharing of utensils during mealtime. Hearing disability, male sex, father's education level, mother's profession, bedtime after 11:00 p.m., anxiety, and depression (OR = 1.45-2.95, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) are risk factors for hand hygiene. Male sex (OR = 2.13, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) is risk factor and being aged below 18 years old (OR = 0.62, <i>p</i> = 0.03) is protective factor for wearing masks. Exercise (OR = 0.32-0.70, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) is the most protective factor for preventive health behaviors.

"COVID-19 vaccination and psychological status of Iranian dental students","The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of COVID-19 vaccination with the quality and quantity of sleep, the level of stress, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders (TMDs) in Iranian dental students. In this cross-sectional research, we applied a questionnaire including 30 questions on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), sleep quality and quantity, Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD), and vaccination status. All vaccinated students of the dental schools located in the city of Tehran were invited to participate in the study. Participants were divided into three groups: those vaccinated for less than a month, those vaccinated for 1-3 months, and those vaccinated for more than 3 months. A paired <i>t</i>-test served for statistical analysis. Overall, 171 out of 235 students (72.77%) completed the questionnaire, among which 90 individuals were fully vaccinated, and were included in the data analysis. Stress levels decreased (mean difference = -1.23, <i>p</i>-value = 0.002) and sleep quality and quantity improved mostly 1-3 months after the vaccination (mean difference = -0.5, <i>p</i>-value = 0.016). However, TMD symptoms were mostly alleviated in people vaccinated for more than 3 months (mean difference = -2.86, <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05). In this respect, no significant difference was observed between the two genders. According to the results of the study, vaccination was associated with the improvement of psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that further longitudinal studies be conducted on larger sample sizes and different age groups by using various data collection methods (especially regarding the assessment of TMD).","Ghadirian, Khami, Tabatabaei, Mirhashemi, Bahrami","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.946408","20221003","COVID-19; depression; sleep; temporomandibular joint disorders; vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38651,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and academic performance of medical postgraduates","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented a major challenge to the health, economic, and social sectors of the entire world. This study aimed to investigate the mental health and academic performance of medical postgraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 20 to April 20, 2022 at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: general information, mental health and academic performance. Mental health outcomes were assessed according to the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale (PHQ-9). A total of 153 valid questionnaires were obtained. Of the medical postgraduates in this study, (1) 41.8% had no anxiety symptoms. In addition, 51.0% had mild anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the participants had a severe anxiety or depression disorder; (2) Females experienced significantly more symptoms in mental health measure scores than the males (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01); (3) 78.4% believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had varying degrees of impact on their academics. Doctoral postgraduates showed greater academic stress, and they were more worried about not meeting graduation standards than the master's postgraduates (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences between the surgical postgraduates and internal postgraduates in either mental health or academic performance. Our study found that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a mild impact on the mental health and academic performance of medical postgraduates in China. Females experienced significantly more symptoms on mental health measure scores than the males. Doctoral postgraduates showed greater academic stress than the master's postgraduates. There is uncertainty regarding how long this COVID-19 situation will persist and increasing recognition that there may be periods of recurrence in the future. We need more active curricular innovation and transformation to maintain and improve medical postgraduates' mental health and academic performance.","Yu, Tang, Shi, Chen, Wang, Hu, Yao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.948710","20221003","COVID-19 pandemic; academic performance; education; medical postgraduates; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38652,""
"Health and nutrition emergency response among internally displaced persons at Ranch collective site, Chagni, Ethiopia: The role of emergency operation center, lessons from the field, and way forwards","In October 2020, about 79,041 ethnically Amhara/Agew people had been internally displaced (IDPs) from Metekel zone of Benishangul-Gumuz region and lived in Ranch collective site, Chagni town, Ethiopia. Onsite PHEOC met the health and nutrition needs of the IDPs as per international humanitarian response standards. On January 11/2021, the Amhara Public Health Institute (APHI) established an onsite Public Health Emergency Operation Center (PHEOC) at Ranch collective site. Health workers and vehicles were deployed. A temporary clinic having nine outlets was built. Drugs and medical supplies were mobilized from different sources. The overall response period lasted about 8 months, from December 2020 up to June 2021. A total of 33,410 IDPs had received free essential health services. Mental health and psychosocial support services had been given for 1,803 cases. Specialized medical services such as trachomatous trichiasis (30), cataract surgery (8) and sputum samples for mycobacterium tuberculosis (120) have been done. Moreover, 454 women received antenatal care services and 137 women gave birth at health facilities. About 837 children have got measles supplementary dose and 1,280 adults took a COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 1,448 children under five, 454 pregnant and 402 lactating women had been screened on monthly basis. Of which, severe and moderate malnutrition rate was 46 (3.2%) and 75 (5.2%), respectively. A total of 194 trench latrine seats, 74 shower rooms and 50 hand washing facilities had been constructed. There were no human feces present nor solid wastes accumulated around the shelters or settlements. Both active and passive surveillance activities were carried out throughout the camp life. We also conducted regularly Risk Communication and Community Engagement activities on priority health issues. We adequately met the health and nutrition needs of the IDPs as stated in the Sphere humanitarian handbook.

"Vulnerability assessment of Iran's rural-farmer households during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused an emergency around the world, especially in rural communities, and imposed great disasters on human societies, so it's devastating effects on mental health indicators, economy, environment, and social relations are known to everyone. But the accurate assessment of its damage to human societies can help to manage this phenomenon during and post-COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, the present study was conducted for vulnerability assessment of wheat farmers to the COVID-19 pandemic in northwest Iran. The main data collection tool in this study was a questionnaire that was designed based on the Me-bar model, but for the accurate vulnerability assessment, new parameters were added based on the theoretical research literature and the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample size was selected from 420 wheat farmers living in East Azerbaijan Province, the northwest of Iran, using the Kerjcie and Morgan's table. The results showed that for economic vulnerability, the rural poverty was the most important cause of vulnerability of the studied rural households and access to information was most important cause of social vulnerability. Also, the results showed that for psychological vulnerability, the self-efficacy was the most important cause of vulnerability. In other results, irrigation parameters of agricultural lands were the most important cause of environmental vulnerability. The study results showed that the studied farmers have experienced high levels of vulnerability and were strongly affected by economic, social, psychological, and environmental damages. Moreover, the results showed that the farmers of Shabestar and Maragheh had the highest level of vulnerability. In general, the study results can provide policymakers with new insights into the field of COVID-19 pandemic management because the vulnerability of farmers has been identified using 39 parameters.","Shokati Amghani, Savari, Choobchian","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.994922","20221003","COVID-19; rural society; sustainable livelihoods; vulnerability; wheat farmers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38654,""
"The adverse impact of excessive internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' coping skills: A case study in Hanoi, Vietnam 2021","The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant stressors in Vietnamese adolescents' lives. Coping skills play important roles in helping adolescents contend with stress. This study aimed to evaluate adolescents' coping skills during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine how those skills are impacted by excessive internet use during this pandemic. The study used respondent-driven sampling and Google online survey forms to collect data. The study sample included 5,315 high school students aged 11- 17 years in Hanoi's rural and urban areas. The Kid Coping Scale was applied to examine adolescents' coping, and the coping score was compared among adolescents with different levels of internet use. The average coping score measured by Kid Coping Scale was 20.40 (std = 2.13). About half of adolescents often ""avoid the problem or the area where it happened"" when experiencing a hard time. One-third of adolescents often stopped thinking about the problem they faced. More than one-fourth of respondents stayed online for at least 8 h per day. The online time for learning/other activities showed a reverse dose-response relationship with the coping score; the longer the internet use duration, the lower the coping score. The mean score of coping of Hanoi adolescents was moderate. Internet use has an adverse impact on their coping skills.","Bui, Pham, Le, Pham","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.983153","20221003","COVID-19; adolescent; children; mental health; pandemic effects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38655,""
"How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect food environment, food purchase, and fish consumption among low-income urban households in Bangladesh-A path analysis","Animal source foods, especially fish is the most commonly consumed and an important source of macro and micronutrients in the diet of the urban low-income residents. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the food environment in Bangladesh but little is known about how food access and food prices (affordability) have affected the purchase and consumption of fish. The objective of the study was to understand the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on urban food environment with a specific focus on fish consumption. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 586 homogeneous adults (288 females and 298 males) from separate households from five informal settlements in Dhaka city, Bangladesh during October-November 2020. Data were collected on: (1) food access and affordably; and (2) food purchase and fish consumption. The associations between food access, price, food purchase, and fish consumption were evaluated using path analysis. The majority of respondents reported that food access was more difficult, food prices increased, and food purchase decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-COVID (84-89% of respondents). Fish and meat were more difficult to access, more expensive and purchased less compared to other foods (74-91% of respondents). Compared to pre-COVID period, households consumed less fish during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reported compromised the variety and quality of fish. In the path analysis, food access was associated with food purchase (<i>b</i> = 0.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Food purchase was associated with quantity, variety, and quality of fish consumed. Food price was inversely associated with the quality of fish consumed (<i>b</i> = -0.27, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the food environment, particularly food access, price (affordability), purchase, and consumption, especially of fish. Limited food access negatively affected the quantity, variety and quality of fish consumed. An increase in food prices directly affected the quality of fish consumed. Policy actions are essential to ensure equal access to nutritious foods, such as fish. These policies need to focus on diversity and quality along with preventing increases in food prices during emergencies to mitigate future threats to the nutrition and health of the urban low-income residents.","Akter, Talsma, Feskens, Thilsted, Rasheed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.994236","20221003","COVID-19 pandemic; affordability; fish consumption; food access; food environment; food price; informal settlements; urban poor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38656,""
"Association of Disease-Modifying Therapies with COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis","We conducted this study to assess the effect of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Available studies from PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and gray literature, including reference lists and conference abstracts, were searched from December 1, 2019, to July 26, 2021. We included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies assessing the association of DMTs with risk of contracting COVID-19 or its outcomes in MS patients on univariate or multivariate regression analyses. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the risk of COVID-19 and developing severe infection across DMTs. Out of the initial 3893 records and 1883 conference abstracts, a total of 10 studies were included. Pairwise comparisons showed that none of the DMTs meaningfully affect the risk of acquiring infection. There was significant total heterogeneity and inconsistency across this NMA. In comparison with no DMT, dimethyl fumarate (0.62 (0.42, 0.93)), fingolimod (0.55 (0.32, 0.94)), natalizumab (0.50 (0.31, 0.81)), and interferon (0.42 (0.22, 0.79)) were associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID-19; but, rituximab was observed to increase the risk (1.94 (1.20, 3.12)). Compared to rituximab or ocrelizumab, all DMTs were associated with a decreased risk. Pairwise comparisons showed no differences across other DMTs. Interferon and rituximab were associated with the lowest and highest risks of severe COVID-19. Our study showed an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients on rituximab and ocrelizumab.

"The COVID-19 pandemic, well-being, and transitions to post-secondary education","This study examines the immediate and intermediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of two high school graduation cohorts (2020 and 2021) and how changes in well-being affect students' educational plans and outcomes. Our unique panel data on 3697 students from 214 schools in 8 German federal states contain prospective survey information on three dimensions of well-being: mental health problems, self-rated health, and life satisfaction. Data is collected several months before (fall 2019), shortly before and soon after (spring 2020) as well as several months after (fall/winter 2020/21) the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying difference-in-differences designs, random effect growth curve models, and linear regression models, we find that school closures had a positive immediate effect on students' well-being. Over the course of the pandemic, however, well-being strongly declined, mainly among the 2021 graduation cohort. We show that a strong decline in mental health is associated with changes in educational and career plans and transition outcomes. As adverse life experiences in adolescence are likely to accumulate over the life course, this study is the first to exhibit potential long-lasting negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on education and careers of young individuals.","Sandner, Patzina, Anger, Bernhard, Dietrich","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11150-022-09623-9","20221003","COVID-19; High school graduates; Life satisfaction; Mental and physical well-being; School-to-work transition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38658,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social restrictions on ambulance calls for suicidal and nonsuicidal self-harm: a population-based study in Osaka prefecture, Japan","Self-harm is a common ambulance call and is potentially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the incidence of ambulance transport due to self-harm increased in 2020. We undertook a population-based observational study using a database from the Osaka prefectural government. Ambulance transport of patients due to self-harm from 2016 through 2020 was investigated. We estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios using a Poisson regression model to compare the annual incidence rates of ambulance transport in 2017-2020 with those in 2016.

"An impact model to understand and improve work-life balance in early-career researchers in radiation oncology","The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial effect on mental health and work productivity of early-career researchers working in Radiation Oncology (RO). However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are unclear. The aim of the current qualitative study was therefore to achieve a better understanding of how these effects arose and could be managed in the future. This study was conducted jointly by RO and qualitative health researchers. Data was collected in four online Focus Groups with 6-11 RO researchers (total NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31) working in Europe. The transcripts were analysed through a qualitative cross-impact analysis. Causal relations were identified between seventeen variables that depict the impact of disrupted working conditions. Mental health and work productivity were indeed the most important affected variables, but relations between variables towards these impacts were complex. Relations could either be positive or negative and direct or indirect, leading to a cascade of interrelated events which are highly personal and could change over time. We developed the model 'impact of disrupted working conditions' depicting the identified variables and their relations, to allow more individual assessment and personalised solutions. The impacts of disrupted working conditions on RO researchers varied due to the complexity of interrelated variables. Consequently, collective actions are not sufficient, and a more personal approach is needed. Our impact model is recommended to help guide conversations and reflections with the aim of improving work/life balance. The participants showed high levels of personal responsibility towards their own mental health and work productivity. Although being an individual issue, a collective responsibility in developing such approaches is key due to the dependency on organizational variables.","Pittens, Dhont, Petit, Dubois, Franco, Mullaney, Aznar, Petit-Steeghs, Bertholet","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2022.09.006","20221003","Early-career; Mental health; Qualitative research; Working conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38661,""
"Suspension of social welfare services and mental health outcomes for women during the COVID-19 pandemic in a peripheral neighborhood in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil","During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazilian urban peripheries have been severely affected both by the spread of the virus and by social, political, and economical dynamics, raising concerns about the psychological wellbeing and mental health of the population living in these areas. The pandemic broke out in a context of reduced public spending in social and health policies as well as in a process of erosion of social rights, fostering processes of exclusion and highlighting the association between austerity, the increase in poverty and inequality as well as in health and mental health problems indicators. This article presents the results of a qualitative participatory research that investigated subjective experiences in a peripheral neighborhood of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil, aiming to understand how contextual dynamics played a role in shaping mental health experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. A multidisciplinary team of researchers worked closely with local volunteers trained to provide emotional support calls to neighbors of the community who signed up for the project. This article presents three ethnographic cases of women who had their routines strongly affected by the suspension of public and social protection services for the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, leading to psychological suffering due to the increased demand of ""domestic circuits of care"". We argue that within a context of austerity, the pandemic was remarkably harsh in urban peripheries and, specifically, for women with caring responsibilities. In addition to highlighting the pervasive ""social protection gap"", the cases presented in this paper also reveals the unequal dynamics of the social reproduction work in several layers, which falls mainly on women's shoulders. The ""crisis of care"", proposed by gender and feminist scholars, can contribute to understanding the psychological outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic for these women.","Bruhn, Szabzon, Abarca Brown, Ravelli Cabrini, Miranda, Andrade","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.897276","20221003","Brazil; coronavirus; gender equity/inequality; global health; mental health; social support; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38662,""
"Relationship between social support, anxiety, and depression among frontline healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pandemic","Social support is an important factor affecting individual mental health. However, the relationship between social support and mental health in frontline healthcare workers (FHW) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has garnered less attention. In this study, we aimed to investigate the level of social support and the prevalence of depression and anxiety in FHW during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine the factors affecting the relationship between social support, depression, and anxiety. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted to collect data from FHW between 15 February and 31 March 2020 in China. The data included demographic factors, Self-rated Depression Scale (SDS), Self-rated Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS). Spearman correlation test was performed to determine the correlation among SAS, SDS, and SSRS scores. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship among demographic factors, social support, depression, and anxiety in FHW. Of all 201 participants, 44 (21.9%) had depressive symptoms and 32 (15.9%) had anxiety symptoms. The average total SSRS scores among FHW were lower than that of the norms of the Chinese general population (37.17 Ã‚Â± 7.54 versus 44.38 Ã‚Â± 8.38, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Marital status positively affected the SSRS score (ÃŽÂ² = 7.395, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Age over 40 years old negatively affected the SSRS score (ÃŽÂ² = -5.349, <i>P</i> = 0.017). The total SSRS score, subjective social support score, objective social support score, and support utilization score among FHW negatively correlated with the SAS score and SDS score (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). A lower support utilization score was significantly associated with high anxiety and depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = -0.869, <i>P</i> = 0.024; ÃŽÂ² = -1.088, <i>P</i> = 0.035, respectively). During the COVID-19 pandemic, FHW experienced depression, anxiety, and inadequate social support. The marital status and age had a major impact on social support. Social support was inversely associated with depression and anxiety. Improving the mental health of FHW by strengthening social support is crucial. Future studies are needed to investigate how to improve the level of social support and mental health condition of FHW facing public health emergencies in the future.","Zhan, Chen, Yan, Wei, Zhan, Chen, Lu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.947945","20221003","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; frontline healthcare workers; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38663,""
"Common mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong: Age-related differences and implications for dementia risk","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a profound negative impact on the mental health and wellbeing of societies and individuals worldwide. Older adults may be more vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic, either directly from the infection itself or indirectly through the preventive measures. However, the existing literature on mental health in the older age groups has not been consistent so far. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMD; including depression and anxiety disorders) given their association with dementia risk, and to further examine age-related differences between older (Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years old) and younger (18-59 years old) adult's psychological status during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey-study conducted during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. The survey was disseminated through different social media platforms to the general population and included sociodemographic questions, self-reported physical health, and previous encounter with SARS or COVID-19. CMD was the primary outcome and was assessed using the 6-item Kessler Scale. A total of 1030 adults fulfilled inclusion criteria. The prevalence of CMD during the pandemic was 16.1%. Compared to younger adults, older adults were significantly less likely to have a CMD (unadjusted OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02-0.30, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with 18.1% of younger adults having CMD compared to 1.6% in the older cohort. Age differences remained significant after controlling for sociodemographic factors, physical health, and previous encounter with SARS or COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.02-0.57, <i>p</i> = 0.008). Common mental disorders are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, though older adults appeared to be less affected mentally. Present findings highlight the urgent need to implement measures and strategies to mitigate the mental health problems, with particular attention to the younger cohort. Given their association with higher dementia risk, early detection and treatment of depression and anxiety disorders will be of critical importance in providing some relief to the already pressurized dementia burden in the longer term.","Kwok, Yan, Kwok, Cheng, Lin, Wong, Cheng, Lee, Lam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.909162","20221003","COVID-19; age; anxiety; dementia; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38664,""
"Quarantine and demographic characteristics as predictors of perceived stress and stress responses during the third year of COVID-19 in China","Quarantine as one of the most effective epidemic prevention measures, significantly increased people's stress levels. Ongoing monitoring of the stress status of people under quarantine during the pandemic is an important part of assessing the long-term impact of COVID-19 on mental health. This study aimed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the stress status of people under quarantine, including perceived stress and stress responses, during the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. An anonymous online survey was conducted among 464 participants from 39 cities in China from March 31 to April 12, 2022. The survey included three questionnaires: a self-designed questionnaire collecting demographic information and quarantine characteristics, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Stress Response Questionnaire (SRQ). The <i>t</i>-test or one-way ANOVA or the Welch <i>F</i>-test were used to examine the differences among demographic and quarantine variables of perceived stress and stress responses, then multiple linear regressions were performed to identify the predictors of perceived stress and stress responses. 428 valid respondents were finally included. The average scores of perceived stress, total stress response, emotional response, physical response, and behavioral response were 14.70 Ã‚Â± 7.02, 50.24 Ã‚Â± 22.48, 20.35 Ã‚Â± 9.99, 15.23 Ã‚Â± 7.25, and 11.39 Ã‚Â± 5.27, respectively. The regression analysis showed that the degree of financial worries and days of continuous quarantine were the predictors of perceived stress. The degree of financial worries was a vital factor in predicting total stress response, emotional response, physical response and behavioral response, and in predicting emotional response, age was also a significant predictor. The stress status of individuals under quarantine was generally stable but still needs further attention during the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic. People who are young, have a high degree of financial worries and have been quarantined for a long time may be at a higher risk of perceived stress and stress responses. Relevant authorities should pay closer attention to the risk groups, and additional support and assistance might be required for those mostly worried about their financial situations under quarantine.","Gao, Xu, Shi, Zhang, Zhang, Jiang, Wei, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.962285","20221003","COVID-19; behavioral response; emotional response; perceived stress; physical response; quarantine; stress responses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38665,""
"Association among resilience, post-traumatic stress disorder, and somatization in frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19: The mediating role of perceived stress","Frontline healthcare workers were at a high risk of infection and developing mental health problems during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is important to monitor the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and somatization among frontline healthcare workers in China. This study aimed to investigate PTSD, somatization, resilience, and perceived stress among frontline healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19 and examine the mediating effects of perceived stress on resilience in both PTSD and somatization. The study was conducted from December 2021 to February 2022 through an online survey of frontline healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19. The survey included questions regarding socio-demographic information, resilience (10-item Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC-10), perceived stress (14-item Perceived Stress Scale, PSS), PTSD (Checklist-Civilian Version, PCL-C), and somatization (Symptom Checklist-90). The PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to examine the mediating effects of perceived stress. Approximately 14.9% of healthcare workers had possible PTSD (PCL-C score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 44), and 41.04% of the workers had low resilience (CD-RISC-10 score of Ã¢â€°Â¤ 25.5). Approximately 54.05% of healthcare workers were symptomatic, and 14.7% had a moderate or higher degree of somatization with sleep-related problems as the most common symptom. Perceived stress was negatively correlated with resilience (<i>r</i> = -0.527, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and positively correlated with PTSD (<i>r</i> = 0.505, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and somatization (<i>r</i> = 0.361, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, perceived stress mediated the relationship between resilience and PTSD [indirect <i>b</i> = -0.382; bootstrapped confidence interval (CI), -0.454, -0.319] and somatization (indirect effect <i>b</i> = -0.159; bootstrapped CI, -0.199, -0.123). The prevalence of PTSD and somatic symptoms indicates that the mental health of frontline healthcare workers deserves more attention. Resilience is negatively associated with PTSD and somatization, and the relationship among resilience, PTSD, and somatization is mediated by perceived stress. Strategies for reducing perceived stress and increasing resilience may help to prevent and alleviate PTSD and somatization.","Li, Yu, Wang, Wang, Yao, Ma, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.909071","20221003","COVID-19; China; PTSD; frontline healthcare workers; mediation; perceived stress; resilience; somatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38666,""
"Building and implementing a contactless clinical trial protocol for patients with COVID-19: A Korean perspective","To effectively manage patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while minimizing contact between medical staff, clinical trial protocol that facilitates contactless patient management was designed to predict deterioration of disease condition and monitor mental health status. Through consultation with infectious disease specialists and psychiatrists, this study identified main clinical indicators related to respiratory and non-respiratory outcomes, and mental health. Telehealth devices that could collect relevant data indicators were explored. The following three modes were identified: wearable devices, video calls, and online questionnaires. Clinical trial protocol was implemented to patients confirmed with COVID-19 infection and admitted to Seongnam residential treatment centers between September 1, 2021 and December 30, 2021. Data were collected from wearable devices, video calls, online questionnaires, and from electronic health records. Participant satisfaction was assessed through an online survey at the time of discharge. In total, 120 asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients participated in this trial. Seven types of physiological and life log data were collected from 87 patients using wearable devices, video and audio recordings, and online mental health-related questionnaire. Most participants were satisfied with the overall trial process, but perceived difficulties in using telehealth devices. This trial collected simultaneously generated multimodal patient data using various telehealth devices in a contactless setting for COVID-19 patients. Data collected in this study will be used to build a remote patient management system based on the prediction algorithms.","Bae, Sung, Lee, Lee, Chie","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.975243","20221003","COVID-19; clinical trial; telemedicine; video recording; wearable electronic devices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38667,""
"COVID-19 neuropsychiatric repercussions: Current evidence on the subject","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has affected the entire world, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since it was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Among the clinical presentation of the disease, in addition to fever, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, infected patients may also experience neurological and psychiatric repercussions during the course of the disease and as a post-COVID-19 sequelae. Thus, headache, dizziness, olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, cerebrovascular disorders, neuromuscular abnormalities, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder can occur both from the infection itself and from social distancing and quarantine. According to current evidence about this infection, the virus has the ability to infect the central nervous system (CNS) <i>via</i> angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells. Several studies have shown the presence of ACE2 in nerve cells and nasal mucosa, as well as transmembrane serine protease 2, key points for interaction with the viral Spike glycoprotein and entry into the CNS, being olfactory tract and blood-brain barrier, through hematogenous dissemination, potential pathways. Thus, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS supports the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The management of these manifestations seems more complex, given that the dense parenchyma and impermeability of brain tissue, despite protecting the brain from the infectious process, may hinder virus elimination. Still, some alternatives used in non-COVID-19 situations may lead to worse prognosis of acute respiratory syndrome, requiring caution. Therefore, the aim of this review is to bring more current points related to this infection in the CNS, as well as the repercussions of the isolation involved by the pandemic and to present perspectives on interventions in this scenario.","da Silva JÃƒÂºnior, Santos Apolonio, Cuzzuol, da Costa, Silva, AraÃƒÂºjo, Silva Luz, Marques, Santos, Pinheiro, Lima de Souza GonÃƒÂ§alves, Calmon, Freire de Melo","https://doi.org/10.5662/wjm.v12.i5.365","20221003","COVID-19; Central nervous system; Mental disorders; Neurologic disorders; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38668,""
"Methodology Considerations in Studying Mental Health, Sleep Quality, and Biopsychosocial Determinants Among Chinese and Korean Americans During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Asians are one of the fastest-growing racial groups in the United States. The mental health of Asian Americans, particularly regarding depression and anxiety, needs significant attention. Various biopsychosocial factors interact to influence the risks of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality among Asian Americans. Currently, multiple methodological issues exist in the research of Asian Americans, such as limited data collection using Asian languages and inconsistent reporting of race and ethnicity data, which may be lacking entirely. All these methodological issues in research may account for the seemingly low prevalence rates of mental health problems among Asian Americans. In our study on mental health and sleep quality among Chinese and Korean Americans, we adopted multiple data collection strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, including using culturally adaptive and validated measures as well as operating culture-sensitive procedures in the recruitment and data collection. The successful use of these strategies could promote early detection and personalized treatment of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among Asian Americans. These strategies would further improve health care service use in this population.

"The parental psychological distress caused by separation from their critically ill child during the COVID-19 pandemic: A tale of two cities","A child's critical illness is a stressful event for the entire family, causing significant emotional distress among parents and changes to family functioning. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has abruptly caused modifications in visitation policies of Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) in many countries. We hypothesized that caregivers with no or severely restricted access to PICUs would demonstrate increased psychological distress as compared to those who had limitless access (LA) to PICUs. Sociodemographic variables, levels of psychological distress, ratings of family functioning, and ability to cope with stressful events were collected with an online survey in a group of caregivers after their child's hospitalization. Ratings of psychological distress were compared between caregivers with no/severely restricted (NA) and with LA to PICUs. Measures of depression, anxiety, and global severity index (GSI) of psychological distress were significantly higher in NA caregivers as compared to LA. Among demographic characteristics of the sample, only gender influenced the severity of psychological symptoms: women showed an increased score on levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, and GSI. Avoidant coping style positively correlated with measures of depression. Univariate General Linear Model (GLM) analyses of the effects of sex, age, visitation policies of PICUs, and score of avoidant coping strategies on measures of psychological distress confirmed a significant univariate effect of no access to PICUs on parents' psychopathological scores. Restrictions imposed on visitation policies in PICU during the pandemic negatively impacted families' psychological wellbeing. A balance between the safety of patients, families, and health care professionals and meeting the needs of families is of utmost importance.","Camporesi, Abecasis, Torres, Zoia, Izzo, Ferrario, Melloni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.909210","20221003","COVID-19; PICU visitation policies; caregivers; psychological distress; separation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38670,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on waitlisted pre-bariatric surgery patients in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of bariatric surgeries was decreased to ensure patient safety. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of such delays on the psychological status and weight management behaviors of waitlisted pre-bariatric surgery patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted. Results were then evaluated with simple descriptive statistics and inferential analyses through the Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and the general linear regression model. Of 437 patients, 208 successfully completed the survey. Approximately half of the participants reported weight change (46.6%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 97), while other weight management behaviors remained unchanged. The mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score of the respondents was 8.29Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.3, indicating mild depression. Higher PHQ-9 scores were associated with being a student, unhealthy dietary habits, physical inactivity, worsened psychological status, and weight gain. Among these factors, being a student was the strongest predictor of the total PHQ-9 score. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the psychological status of patients with obesity on the bariatric surgery waitlist. Since delays in bariatric surgeries could worsen patients' psychological status, as substantiated in this study, the provision of virtual care through telemedicine and the development of policies for reintroducing bariatric surgeries for future lockdowns are highly recommended.","Magliah, Alzahrani, Sabban, Abulaban, Turkistani, Magliah, Jaber","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104767","20221003","BMI, body mass index; Bariatric surgery waiting list; COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; ICU, intensive care unit; Obesity; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Psychological impact; SD, standard deviation; SR, Saudi Riyals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38671,""
"Exploring the self-reported physical fitness and self-rated health, mental health disorders, and body satisfaction among Chinese adolescents: A cross-sectional study","Physical activity (PA) and Physical fitness (PF) have received tremendous attention in the field of physical and mental health. However, limited attention has been given to the associations of self-reported physical fitness with some health-related outcomes. Given the COVID-19 pandemic is still active in many Chinese regions, assessing health-related physical fitness (HRPF) in adolescents using field-based assessment (such as a shuttle run for cardiorespiratory fitness) is unrealistic, therefore, this study was conducted via a self-reported questionnaire. The present cross-sectional study was aimed at delving into the relationship between self-reported physical fitness with self-rated health, depression, anxiety, and body satisfaction in adolescents. Three thousand eight hundred and seven study participants from 12 public schools in South-eastern China were recruited and 2,407 of them provided valid data on variables that this study needed for analysis. Study participants were asked to self-report their sociodemographic factors (e.g., sex, grade, age), independence, and outcomes. Generalized linear models were used to explore the associations of self-reported physical fitness (comprising general physical fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, speed and agility, and flexibility) with depression, anxiety, and body satisfaction. A total of 2,407 children and adolescents with a mean age of 13.82 (Ã‚Â±2.1) years were included in the final study analysis. Higher self-reported levels of general physical fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with better self-rated health, and body satisfaction but with lower risks of depression and anxiety. The current study offered evidence on the roles of self-reported physical fitness and health-related outcomes.

"Teachers' dissatisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic: Factors contributing to a desire to leave the profession","The COVID-19 pandemic required more responsibilities from teachers, including implementing prevention strategies, changes in school policies, and managing their own mental health, which yielded higher dissatisfaction in the field. A cross-sectional web survey was conducted among educators to collect information on their experiences teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the 2020-2021 academic year. Qualtrics, an online survey platform, fielded the survey from May 6 to June 8, 2021 to a national, convenience sample of 1,807 respondents. Findings revealed that overall, 43% of K-12 teachers reported a greater intention to leave the profession than previously recalled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Intention to leave was multi-level, and associated with socio-demographic factors (e.g., age: AOR = 1.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), individual factors (e.g., perceived COVID risks: AOR = 1.44, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and teachers' agency (e.g., dissatisfaction with school/district communications and decisions: AOR = 1.34, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). We also found demographic disparities with respect to race and gender (e.g., female teachers: AOR: 1.78, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) around teachers' ability to provide feedback to schools on opening/closing and overall dissatisfaction with school/district COVID-19 prevention strategies implementation and policies. These findings are consistent with the Job-Demand and Resources Model (JD-R), which posits that lack of organizational support can exacerbate job stressors, leading to burnout. Specifically, dissatisfaction with the way school policies were implemented took a toll on teachers' mental health, leading to a desire to leave the profession. These findings are also consistent with research conducted once in-person teaching resumed in 2020-2021, specifically that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated preexisting teacher shortages that led to self-reported issues of stress, burnout, and retention. Further research is necessary to understand the resources that may be most useful to reduce the demands of teaching in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some teachers are more likely to leave the field, and educational agencies may wish to target their teacher-retention efforts with emphasis on strong employee wellness programs that help educators to manage and reduce their stress. Education agency staff may wish to review policies and practices to provide meaningful opportunities to give input to school/district decisions and enable proactive communication channels.","Gillani, Dierst-Davies, Lee, Robin, Li, Glover-Kudon, Baker, Whitton","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.940718","20221003","COVID-19; job satisfaction; mental health; prevention strategies; retention; school policies; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38673,""

"Depression and PTSD in the aftermath of strict COVID-19 lockdowns: a cross-sectional and longitudinal network analysis","<b>Background:</b> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are two highly comorbid psychological outcomes commonly studied in the context of stress and potential trauma. In Hubei, China, of which Wuhan is the capital, residents experienced unprecedented stringent lockdowns in the early months of 2020 when COVID-19 was first reported. The comorbidity between PTSD and MDD has been previously studied using network models, but often limited to cross-sectional data and analysis. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aims to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal network structures of MDD and PTSD symptoms using both undirected and directed methods. <b>Methods:</b> Using three types of network analysis - cross-sectional undirected network, longitudinal undirected network, and directed acyclic graph (DAG) - we examined the interrelationships between MDD and PTSD symptoms in a sample of Hubei residents assessed in April, June, August, and October 2020. We identified the most central symptoms, the most influential bridge symptoms, and causal links among symptoms. <b>Results:</b> In both cross-sessional and longitudinal networks, the most central depressive symptoms included sadness and depressed mood, whereas the most central PTSD symptoms changed from irritability and hypervigilance at the first wave to difficulty concentrating and avoidance of potential reminders at later waves. Bridge symptoms showed similarities and differences between cross-sessional and longitudinal networks with irritability/anger as the most influential bridge longitudinally. The DAG found feeling blue and intrusive thoughts the gateways to the emergence of other symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Combining cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, this study elucidated central and bridge symptoms and potential causal pathways among PTSD and depression symptoms. Clinical implications and limitations are discussed. <b>Antecedentes:</b> El trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (TEPT) y el trastorno depresivo mayor (TDM) son dos resultados psicolÃƒÂ³gicos altamente comÃƒÂ³rbidos que se estudian comÃƒÂºnmente en el contexto del estrÃƒÂ©s y trauma potencial.

"Level of Fear and Its Determinants in the Indian Population Due to COVID-19 Disease","Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. A total of three waves across most of the states in India have been reported to date, during which strict lockdown was imposed and conditional relaxations were offered between the subsequent waves. Amid the high morbidity and mortality, there has been severe psychological distress among people which has led to mental health impairment. Methodology We investigated the level of fear in the Indian population due to COVID-19 using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS-19) and various factors influencing it. A cross-sectional study was undertaken across India among participants more than 18 years of age by recruiting participants through social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram. Along with the FCS-19 questionnaire, sociodemographic information about the participants, preexisting history of comorbidities, and psychiatric illnesses were collected. The study sample was drawn by convenience technique, and the data were collected over two months from October 2021 to December 2021. Results A total of 419 participants (212 females and 207 males) participated in the study. The mean FCS-19 score of the population was 18.29 Ã‚Â± 6.43 (SD). Participants with a history of COVID-19-related deaths in their own family or surrounding areas had a significantly higher FCS-19 score than those without a history of COVID-19-related deaths. The mean FCS-19 score for healthcare professionals was also significantly lower than for other professions. FCS-19 scores were significantly higher among participants with psychiatric conditions than those without. Conclusions The study showed a positive association between a preexisting mental health disease and FCS-19 score and a negative association if the participant was a healthcare professional. While other factors such as age, gender, residential area, and preexisting comorbidity did not show a significant association with fear associated with COVID-19.","Lodha, Acharya, Singh, Kumar, Kohli, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28612","20221003","covid-19; fear and anxiety; fear of covid-19; healthcare worker; public mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38677,""
"Learning Through a Pandemic: Youth Experiences With Remote Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The objective of this paper was to examine the school-related experiences of youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants represented both clinical and community youth aged 14 to 28 who were sampled as part of a larger study. Feedback from youth attending school during the pandemic was qualitatively examined and youth who planned to attend school prior to the pandemic and did (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°246) and youth who planned to attend but did not (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28) were compared quantitatively. Youth appreciated the flexibility of online learning and some also reported experiencing a lack of support from their school and the need for instructor training on how to deliver virtual classes effectively. Future studies should examine what factors influence student engagement with virtual learning, what strategies could improve supports for student in their long-term career development, and the longitudinal experiences of youth who may have chosen not to go back to school due to the pandemic. This survey was conducted in Ontario, Canada. A more diverse sample collected outside of Ontario would improve generalizability. Qualitative data were based on survey responses and not interviews. Thus we were unable to discern the reasons youth decided to attend school, or not, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nandlall, Hawke, Hayes, Darnay, Daley, Relihan, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440221124122","20221003","COVID-19; adolescent; education; mental health; virtual learning; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38678,""
"Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment Model Based on ICD-11 Criteria of Gaming Disorder and Hazardous Gaming During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This commentary aimed to propose the screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model for gaming disorder (GD) and hazardous gaming (HG) on the basis of the International Classification of Disease, 11th version (ICD-11) classification. COVID-19 and its preventive measures increase the risk of GD and the treatment needs could exceed the capacities of mental health systems. Brief intervention could be provided for adolescents with HG after screening. Psychiatrists make diagnoses of GD or HG and then refer them to school counselors, specialized psychologists, or integrated teams based on the severity, comorbidity, and complication of GD. The classification of GD and HG was suitable to develop a SBIRT model intervention. The SBIRT should work through the shortage of resources and provide a brief intervention guild to make it practical.","Yen, Higuchi, Ko, Su","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-022-00444-5","20221003","Adolescents; COVID-19; Collaborative network; Gaming disorder; Hazardous gaming; SBIRT","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38679,""
"Mental health professionals views and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on implementing digital mental health in China: A nationwide survey study","Using digital health technologies (DHTs) to deliver and augment healthcare is an innovative way to solve common challenges that the mental healthcare setting faces. Despite China's rapid development of DHT, a comprehensive understanding of staff views of DHTs is lacking, which limited the evidence to support implementation strategies. In the current study, we aim to: (i) investigate staff attitudes towards digital technology for mental health problems in China; (ii) explore staff's views on the facilitators and barriers regarding uptake and adoption of digital technology in mental health services in China; and (iii) understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed staff views on digital mental health. An online survey was conducted to explore staff attitudes towards implementing DHTs in China. Descriptive statistics were conducted to summarise quantitative data. Free-text data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. 1270 mental health professionals completed the survey. Respondents reported low levels of knowledge of DHTs and moderate levels of accessibility of DHTs in their hospitals. Respondents expressed positive attitudes towards DHTs and demonstrated moderate levels of perceived feasibility and acceptability of implementing DHTs in clinical services. As expected, respondents reported that the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant impacts on their clinical services, and almost all respondents deemed DHTs useful for services provision during the pandemic and were willing to apply such technologies in clinical services after the pandemic. Despite the Chinese mental health staff expressed positive attitudes towards implementing DHTs in clinical practice, most of the staff lacked sufficient knowledge to provide such services. These findings highlight the need to develop implementation strategies such as training programmes and dissemination of research evidence to support the translation of research.","Zhang, Lewis, Chen, Berry, Bucci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100576","20221003","COVID-19; China; Digital mental health; Implementation; Professionals views; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38680,""
"Factors related to mental health effect among nursing students in Japan and the United States during the coronavirus pandemic: A cross-sectional study","In the context of mental health, university students have been considered a vulnerable population. However, limited studies have underscored the association between preventive health behaviour levels and mental health effects among nursing students. The current cross-sectional study provides a comparative analysis of the impact of mental health factors on nursing students in Japan and the United States (US) in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The study consisted of 878 participants, comprising both undergraduate and graduate nursing students from four universities in Japan, and one from the US. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to analyse the participant data in this study. In contrast to the American students, the Japanese students demonstrated significantly lower levels of perceived control and significantly higher levels of preventive health behaviours. Furthermore, Japanese students exhibited significantly higher levels of stress and/or symptoms of depression induced by the social distancing orders compared to the American students (zÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-4.218, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). However, no difference was observed after adjusting for perceived control, individual factors, socio-economic factors, and preventive behaviours. During the pandemic, risk factors that can worsen mental health among the nursing students included younger age [odds ratio (95%CI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.62 (0.48-0.81)], women [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.17 (1.02-4.61)], higher preventive health behaviour [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.05 (1.02-1.08)], lower perceived control [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.97 (0.94-0.99)], and lower perceived health competence [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.93 (0.90-0.96)]. Thus, this study recommends establishing training programmes that enhance perceived control and perceived health competence while encouraging preventive behaviour to support the mental health of nursing students, particularly young female students.","Kondo, Abuliezi, Niitsu, Naruse, Oki, Ota, Ezeonwu","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13075","20221003","COVID-19 pandemic; comparative analysis; control beliefs; mental health; nursing students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38681,""
"Adaptive responding to prolonged stress exposure: A binational study on the impact of flexibility on latent profiles of cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 pandemic","The high level of uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the general population's well-being and capacity for adaptive responding. Studies indicate that flexibility, defined as the ability to choose and employ a variety of emotional, cognitive and behavioural strategies in accordance with changing contextual demands, may significantly contribute to adaptive responding to long-term stressors such as COVID-19. In the current study, we aimed to investigate which facets of flexibility predict different latent profiles of adaptive responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and Germany. A total of 2330 Israelis and 743 Germans completed online questionnaires measuring cognitive and coping regulatory flexibility and cognitive, emotional and behavioural responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses revealed three distinct response profiles in each country (high, medium and low). These profiles differed in both anxiety and depression symptoms with the non-adaptive response group experiencing clinically relevant symptoms both in Israel and Germany. Additionally, cognitive flexibility and coping flexibility emerged as significant predictors of response profiles in both countries. Training cognitive and coping flexibility may thus help individuals respond more adaptively to psychosocial stressors such as COVID-19. Such training could be selectively administered to less flexible subpopulations as well as adapted to the specific population characteristics.","Hemi, Sopp, SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Michael, Levy-Gigi","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14053","20221003","anxiety; depression; flexibility; response; stress exposure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38682,""
"Maternity care during a pandemic: Can a hybrid telehealth model comprising group interdisciplinary education support maternal psychological health?","The transition to parenthood is one of the most challenging across the life course, with profound changes that can impact psychological health. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), came the rapid implementation of remote antenatal care, i.e., telehealth, with fewer in-person consultations. A change in service delivery in addition to the cancellation of antenatal education represented a potential threat to a woman's experience - with likely adverse effects on mental health and wellbeing. To explore a hybrid model of pregnancy care, i.e., telehealth and fewer in-person health assessments, coupled with concurrent small group interdisciplinary education delivered via video conferencing, extending into the postnatal period. Using a quasi-experimental design with an interrupted time series and a control group, this population-based study recruited low-risk women booking for maternity care at one community health site affiliated with a large public hospital in Victoria, Australia. Whilst there was no difference in stress and anxiety scores, a significant interactive effect of the hybrid model of care with time was seen in the DASS depression score (-1.17, 95% CI: -1.81, -0.53) and the EPDS (-0.83, 95% CI: -1.5, -0.15). The analyses provide important exploratory findings regarding the positive effects of a hybrid model of care with interdisciplinary education in supporting mental health of first-time mothers. This study demonstrates that small group online education scheduled in conjunction with individual pregnancy health assessments can be executed within a busy antenatal clinic with promising results and modest but dedicated staff support.","Buultjens, Gill, Fielding, Lambert, Vondeling, Mastwyk, Sloane, Fedele, Karimi, Milgrom, von Treuer, Erbas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2022.09.007","20221002","Antenatal care; Hybrid model; Mental health; Perinatal depression; Pregnancy care; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38683,""
"Implementing a Resilience Bundle for Emergency Nurses: An Evidence-Based Practice Project","Resilience bundles are designed to work within and enhance existing routines. In the wake of COVID-19, nurses are reporting high levels of burnout and are leaving the field at an alarming rate. Hospital system leaders across the country are working to develop wellness programs to improve nurse morale, decrease burnout, and enhance resilience. Resilience can help mitigate nurse burnout, and using a bundle of tools to help nurses develop resilience is more effective than a single strategy. Using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 and the Perceived Stress Scale 4, emergency nurses were surveyed to measure resilience and stress before and after implementation of a 3-strategy resilience bundle. We surveyed at baseline, phase 1 (6Ã‚Â weeks after implementation), and phase 2 (15Ã‚Â weeks after implementation). A statistically significant increase in the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 scores was identified between the baseline and phase 1 surveys. A measurable decrease in the Perceived Stress Scale 4 was found between the baseline survey and the phase 1 and phase 2 postintervention surveys. Although evidence suggests a multifocal approach to improving resilience, use of resilience bundles is new. To enhance nurse resilience and mitigate burnout, nurse leaders may consider resilience bundles to prioritize the mental health and wellness of their staff.","Haugland, Crenshaw, Gilder","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2022.08.009","20221002","Bundle; Burnout; Emergency nursing; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38684,""
"Current psychiatric treatment for college students with depression only, anxiety only, or comorbid depression &amp; anxiety (2013-2019)","This epidemiological study described changes in the estimated prevalence of current pharmacological and/or psychotherapy-based treatment utilization among college students with depression only, anxiety only, or comorbid depression &amp; anxiety. A sample of 190,500 weighted responses was collected through the 2013-2019 Healthy Minds Study questionnaires. Annual prevalence estimates of depression only, anxiety only, or comorbid depression &amp; anxiety were computed. Current use of therapy, pharmacological services, or dual treatment among students with depression and/or anxiety were examined via descriptive statistics. Estimated prevalence of college students who screened positive for depression only, anxiety only, and comorbid depression &amp; anxiety escalated from 2013 to 2018-2019. When assessed individually, rates of currently using any psychiatric medication, participating in therapy, and engaging in concurrent medication &amp; therapy services significantly rose among students with depression and/or anxiety. However, temporal trends in the current use of specific classes of psychiatric medications among young adults with depression only, anxiety only, or comorbid depression &amp; anxiety differed by medication class. This study was unable to assess psychiatric prescribing practices, depression or anxiety diagnoses, and prior mental health treatment. An increasing proportion of college students are reporting depression and/or anxiety symptoms as well as pharmacological and/or psychotherapy service utilization when comparing rates from 2013 to 2018-19. Although this may indicate increasing acceptability to disclose and seek treatment for problematic symptomology, continued surveillance of college populations is needed to identify students at risk for adverse psychiatric health outcomes, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Hoeflich, Nutley, Striley, Miller, Riba, Morris","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.133","20221002","Anxiety; Comorbid depression and anxiety; Depression; Psychiatric medication; Therapy; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38685,""
"Parental psychosocial factors predicting adolescents' psychological adjustment during the surging and remission periods of COVID-19 in China: A longitudinal study","Parents play a critical role in adolescents' psychological adjustment, especially in stress response. Few studies have investigated parental impact on adolescents' psychological adjustment in the pandemic. The longitudinal study examined how parental psychosocial factors at the surging period of the pandemic (T1) in China predicted adolescents' anxiety and depression concurrently and at the remission periods three (T2) and six months (T3) later. Middle and high school students and their parents from three schools in Shanghai, China, completed online surveys on March 10, 2020 (T1), June 16, 2020 (T2), and Sep 25, 2020 (T3). Adolescents' anxiety/depression levels were assessed by matching self- and parent-reports at T1, T2, T3, and parents reported their psychological state (emotion and psychopathology), pandemic response (appraisal and coping), and perceived social support (PSS) at T1. Parental positive/negative emotions, anxiety, depression, control-appraisal, forward- and trauma-focus coping style and PSS were all significantly related to their children's anxiety/depression at T1. All factors, except coping style, predicted adolescents' anxiety/depression at T2 and T3, even after controlling for T1 adjustment levels. Parental positive emotion and depression had the strongest impact on adolescents' adjustment. Some participants didn't complete the surveys at later time points, and the participants were only recruited in Shanghai. The study found that parents' psychosocial factors played a pivotal role on adolescents' psychological adjustment during COVID-19, highlighting the need to provide help to parents who were suffering from potential psychological distress.","Li, Huang, Qiu, Li, Zhu, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.134","20221002","Adolescent; Appraisal; COVID-19; Coping; Emotion; Psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38686,""
"Gun violence in K-12 schools in the United States: Moving towards a preventive (versus reactive) framework","Intentional shootings in K-12 schools in the U.S. persist as a public health problem. The number of shootings in K-12 schools has increased precipitously since 2017. And with approximately 100,000Ã¢â‚¬Â¯K-12 public schools nationally serving 51 million children, investing in a comprehensive gun violence prevention strategy is critical. Unfortunately, our current school gun violence prevention approach almost exclusively centers reactive strategies that are in place to respond to acts of gun violence in the moment, rather than preventive strategies that would prevent them from occurring at all. Reliance on these strategies alone, however, is not sufficient. In line with the core tenets of public health prevention and the Whole School, Whole Child, Whole Community model, we present a more expansive school gun violence prevention framework that broadens the spectrum of what constitutes ""school gun violence prevention."" Our work highlights how enhancing basic neighborhood and school structures-including investments in public libraries, affordable housing, and universal school-based violence prevention programs-are key to both preventing gun violence and promoting well-being. We also highlight the role of stricter gun laws, reasonable school security efforts, bystander interventions, building awareness within school communities, and meaningful investments in early interventions and mental health services. Children, who have been tragically exposed to any number of adverse experiences in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, deserve more reasoned choices and large-scale investments in understanding and cutting off the root causes of school gun violence; not just a reliance on strategies that focus on what to do in the moment of a violent act. As gun violence in K-12 schools persists, we must reframe the discourse about school gun violence around prevention, not reaction.","Rajan, Reeping, Ladhani, Vasudevan, Branas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107280","20221002","Child health; Gun violence; School health; School safety; School shooting; School violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38687,""
"Asian American nursing students' experiences of racial microaggressions amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Focus group discussions","This study aimed to explore the thoughts and feelings of Asian American nursing students regarding Anti-Asian racism that they might anticipate or experience during their clinical training. Asian Americans have long been viewed as perpetual foreigners and coronavirus disease 2019 has reinforced that negative view. Asian American nursing students may anticipate and experience racial discrimination during their clinical training, which could negatively affect their mental health. This is a qualitative research study using focus group discussions. Focus group discussions were conducted over Zoom and audiotaped. The audiotapes were transcribed and validated for accuracy. A thematic analysis was performed using NVivo10. Emerging themes and subthemes were compared and discussed until agreements were made. Nineteen students participated in four focus group meetings, of which, 13 (68 %) had clinical training and six (32 %) were preclinical students. Four major themes emerged: (a) looking forward to hands-on learning opportunities, (b) enduring racial microaggressions, (c) maintaining professionalism in the face of racial microaggressions and (d) standing up for oneself and other Asian American healthcare workers. Preclinical students were anxiously waiting for clinical training so that they could have hands-on learning experiences. They anticipated that anti-Asian racism in clinical settings would be similar to what they had experienced on the streets and therefore, they were not afraid of it. Students who had clinical training reported experiencing a variety of racial microaggressions that varied from ""side-eyes"" to ""verbal assault"" and occurred at three levels: patients, nurses and clinical instructors. They reported that most of the microaggressions were familiar to them, but some, especially coming from their clinical instructors, were unique to clinical settings. Asian American nursing students experienced racial microaggressions during their clinical training which came from patients, nurses on the unit and their clinical instructors. Nevertheless, the students strove to maintain professionalism and stand up for themselves and other Asian healthcare workers as they gained confidence in clinical knowledge and skills.","Kim, Roberts, Khusbo, Watriboonruang, Parks, Lewczyk","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2022.103459","20221002","Asian Americans; COVID-19; Mental health; Nursing students; Racial discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38688,""
"[Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema as complica-tions of COVID-19]","Spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are serious complications of COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, occurring in approximately 1% of hospitalized patients. The risk increases with the accumulation of risk factors, namely moderate or severe illness, high-flow oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation. The pathophysiology may be contributed to by patient self-inflicted lung injury. Hypoxia-induced respiratory effort in patients with pneumonia puts an enormous load on certain parts of their lungs, leading to subsequent progression of lung tissue damage. These complications start with destruction of the alveolar membrane, accompanied by emergence of a pulmonary bulla. Rupture of the bulla results in air leaking to the pleural space (pneumothorax). In the case of pneumomediastinum, the air spreads within the peribronchial interstitium along the airways to the mediastinum and subcutaneous tissues (Macklin effect). While pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema resolve spontaneously in most cases, pneumothorax treatment depends on its magnitude. While small pneumothorax may be managed conservatively, large pneumothorax usually requires active treatment with an acute chest drain; the latter is also associated with worse prognosis and a higher chance of death. We report air-leak complications in nine COVID-19 patients, of whom seven had spontaneous pneumothorax and four of them died. Three patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum together with subcutaneous emphysema, with two of them surviving. One patient with combination of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema died. These complications may accompany moderate or severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia, mostly the late phase of the disease. They should be considered when patients complain of sudden chest or back pain or worsening respiratory insufficiency.","KonÃƒÂ­Ã„ÂkovÃƒÂ¡, PuÃ…Â¡kÃƒÂ¡Ã…Â¡, NovotnÃƒÂ¡, Chrdle","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Pneumothorax,+pneumomediastinum+and+subcutaneous+emphysema+as+complica-tions+of+COVID-19].","20221003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38689,""
"The role of psychiatry in quality of life in young patients with non-small cell lung cancer","Background Lung cancer is often seen in geriatric patients, with an age of onset of approximately 60 years. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and around the world. Young patients are rarely diagnosed with lung cancer, with less than 3.5% of patients presenting with this tumor at an age less than 45. In this paper, we examine NSCLC in young patients, between 18 and 35 years of age, which most commonly occurs in non-smokers and is characterized by a higher proportion of adenocarcinoma histology and advanced disease at presentation. These patients often present with metastasis involving one organ and they test positive for driver gene mutations including, but not limited to, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sensitive mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). We addressed depression and anxiety and their effect on quality of life (QOL) and attempted to examine how improvement in QOL in these young patients could affect their course of illness and prognosis. Methods We conducted a literature review using PubMed, Cochrane, and Google search. We concentrated our search on two elements, reviewing approximately 50 articles focusing on the driver mutations EGFR and ALK as well as genetic mapping of lung adenocarcinoma in patients aged 18â€“35 years old. We also conducted a review of approximately 30 articles focusing on quality of life in the context of anxiety and depression within this patient population. Results We have described a case of a 28-year-old male with new-onset metastatic lung adenocarcinoma that we had treated in our hospital. He was found to have mutations in EGFR and ALK rearrangement. We aimed to address his depression, anxiety, and poor QOL in the context of his diagnosis. Due to his presenting symptoms leading to the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, he was treated with pharmacotherapy as well as conventional therapy to improve his QOL. Due to the time required to identify mutations, our patient passed away before a more targeted treatment could be offered. Conclusion It is important to fully explore the nature of the cancer, including mutation types. Our case demonstrates that the detection of the driver gene mutation EGFR and/or ALK rearrangement could affect treatment and prognosis in this patient population. There are many studies available that highlight targeted therapies for these mutations as well as chemotherapy and radiation. Psychiatry has a significant role in improving quality of life in these patients, which could enhance their response to treatment and survival. Involving psychiatry early in the course results in lower rates of depression, anxiety and premature death.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100507","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38690,""

"The Complex Relationship between Adiposity, Fitness, Mental Wellbeing, and Exercise on Preadolescent Brain Health","Background: Obesity is an epidemic, affecting >340 million children and adolescents worldwide. When left untreated, obesity increases the risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive decline, and mental health disorders. However, enhanced cardiovascular fitness through participation in exercise can prevent obesity, and consequently, promotes physical health, cognitive and brain health, and mental wellbeing. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine the mediating influence of adiposity and mental wellbeing on the preadolescent brainâ€™s response to acute exercise. Methods: In a sample of 58 children (ages 8-10; 19 females), demographic measures of age, sex, IQ, and socioeconomic status were considered. Children participated in a randomized crossover study, whereby they completed two different interventions; seated rest or treadmill walking, counterbalanced across participants. Associations between adiposity measures (body mass index [BMI], whole body percent fat), cardiorespiratory fitness measures (VO2max and Fat-Free VO2), and self-reported measures of mental wellbeing were assessed on cognitive performance (response accuracy, reaction time) and neuroelectric (P3 amplitude and latency) indices of a Go/NoGo task following both exercise and rest interventions. Results: Higher adiposity (whole-body percent fat, BMI) was associated with higher trait anxiety (pâ€™s=0.05) and disordered eating (pâ€™s=0.05) scores. Higher fitness (VO2max) was associated with lower childhood depression scores (p=0.02). With higher whole-body percent fat, trait anxiety increased and mediated poorer neuroelectric metrics (P3 amplitude decrease) on the NoGo Task, after exercise (95%CI=-0.43,-0.11). In children with higher adiposity (whole-body percent fat, BMI), associations were observed with greater cognitive performance and effective neuroelectric profile during a Go/NoGo task (increased accuracy, decreased SD RT, increased P3 amplitude, decreased P3 latency) after rest (pâ€™s=0.05), but not after the exercise intervention (pâ€™s>0.05). In children with higher fitness (VO2max, FF-VO2), associations were observed with better performance on the Go/NoGo task (greater accuracy, lower SD RT) after exercise (pâ€™s=0.05), but not after rest (pâ€™s>0.05). Conclusion: As rates of childhood obesity, anxiety, and physical inactivity continue to increase worldwide, these results have implications for the mental health and wellness of children. By addressing the obesity epidemic with cost-effective behavioral treatments such as exercise, improvements in the rate of psychopathology development in youth, and consequently, improvements in cognitive and brain function, may also benefit.","Nicole Logan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00B0-C67-F50","20221003","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; obesity; childhood; mental health; exercise; cognition; brain function; fitness","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","",38694,""
