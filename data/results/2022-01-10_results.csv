"Psychosocial Adjustment of Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Resident Doctors, Nurses, and Caregivers Need Extra Attention","Objective: This study aimed to examine the psychosocial adjustment and its association with occupation, hospital unit, social support, and Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) attitude in the healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in two pandemic hospitals with a total of 557 participants, which included healthcare professionals of all occupations and all hospital units. Socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 attitude and knowledge were evaluated with the data form. The hospital anxiety-depression scale (HADS), beck hopelessness scale (BHS), maslach burnout inventory (MBI), fear of COVID-19 scale (FC-19S), and multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) were used to assess psychosocial adjustment and social support. Results: Females had higher levels of HADS-anxiety, FC-19S, MBI-emotional exhaustion, and MSPSS-friend and MSPSS-significant other subscales (p&lt;0.05). Scores of BHS (highest in resident doctors and caregivers), HADS-anxiety (highest in resident doctor), HADS-depression (highest in caregivers), and MBI-emotional exhaustion and MBI-depersonalization (highest in the resident doctors) were seen to differ with occupation (p&lt;0.05). Scores of HADS-Depression, FC-19S, and MBI-emotional exhaustion were higher in participants working at the intensive care unit (p&lt;0.05). Having COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction examination history was related to higher scores of BHS, HADS-anxiety, HADSdepression, and FC-19S, and lower scores of MSPSS scores (p&lt;0.05). MSPSS scores were negatively correlated with HADS-anxiety, HADSdepression, MBI-emotional exhaustion, and MBI-depersonalization scores. Conclusion: Results indicate that gender, occupation, and hospital unit influence the psychosocial adjustment of healthcare professionals. Moreover, social support, COVID-19 attitude, and psychosocial adjustment are interrelated with each other.

"Coping with autism during lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is thought to have greatly impacted families of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to lockdown, given lack of access to healthcare, therapy, and day-care centers. This survey was conducted to understand the magnitude of the impact of lockdown, and its effect on the health and behavior of individuals with ASD and their families. Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey, disseminated to families registered with our hospital and collaborating centers. The survey questionnaire collected information on sociodemographic details, details of the patient's and parents' behavior and health during the COVID-19 lockdown, and treatment details of the patient. Results: A total of 153 families completed the survey. Of the 153, nearly half of the individuals with ASD had an inadequate understanding of lockdown, 54% had increased screen-time, while a third reported new-onset behavioral changes. About 40% received online therapies, of which 85% reported benefits. Of the 132 who answered the parent's section, 55% reported decreased interest and/or pleasure in doing daily activities and 43% felt depressed and/or hopeless. About 80% of families reported short-term positive changes such as improved speech, language skills, and participation in household chores. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routines, triggered behavioral issues in individuals with ASD, and impacted the coping skills of both individuals and families, along with the mental health and well-being of the family. Valuable suggestions to improve therapy services and clinical care using technology have been uncovered and need to be explored.","Kaku, Sowmyashree, Chandran, Suhas, Roopa, N.; Choudhary, Aakash, Ramesh, Jayashree, Somashekariah, Suchita, Kuduvalli, Sowmya, Rao, Vanitha, Mysore, Ashok","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_344_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 63(6):568-574, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25065,""
"Correlates of Psychotic Like Experiences (PLEs) During Pandemic: An Online Study Investigating a Possible Link Between the SARS-CoV-2 Infection and PLEs Among Adolescents","Background This study investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, cigarette, alcohol, drug usage contribute to psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) among adolescents during the pandemic. We also aimed to explore whether baseline inflammatory markers or the number of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms are associated with PLEs, and the latter is mediated by internalizing symptoms. Methods Altogether, 684 adolescents aged 12-18 (SARS-CoV-2 group n=361, control group (CG) n=323) were recruited. The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences-42-Positive Dimension (CAPE-Pos), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires were completed by all volunteers using an online survey. C-reactive Protein and hemogram values, and SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms during the acute infection period were recorded in the SARS-CoV-2 group. Group comparisons, correlations, logistic regression, and bootstrapped mediation analyses were performed. Results CAPE-Pos-Frequency/Stress scores were significantly higher, whereas GAD-7-Total and PSQI-Total scores were significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2 than CG. Among the SARS-CoV-2 group, monocyte count and the number of SARS-CoV-2-symptoms were positively correlated with CAPE-Pos-Frequency/Stress scores. Besides SARS-CoV-2, cigarette use, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scores significantly contributed to the presence of at least one CAPE-Pos â€œoftenâ€ or â€œalmost alwaysâ€. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 fully mediated the relationship between the number of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and CAPE-Pos-Frequency. Conclusions This study is the first to show a possible relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and PLEs among adolescents. Depression, anxiety, and cigarette use also contributed to PLEs. The number of SARS-Cov-2-symptoms and PLEs association was fully mediated by internalizing symptoms, but prospective studies will need to confirm this result.","Kafali, Helin Yilmaz, Turan, Serkan, Akpinar, Serap, Mutlu, MÃ¼ge, Parlakay, Aslinur Ã–zkaya, Ã‡Ã¶p, Esra, Toulopoulou, Timothea","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2021.12.049","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Schizophrenia Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25066,""
"P0815 Internet-related variables negatively predicting quality of life and sleep during the pandemic","Introduction: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is, in many ways, specific. In addition, the Internet usage during the pandemic has taken on a new dimension. On one hand, maintaining social contacts with friends/families to reduce psychological impacts of isolation, providing access to entertainment and even materials guiding physical exercises are all realized through information and communication technologies. All these are also the strategies recommended by the WHO. On the other hand, longer Internet hours coupled with the specifics of the Internet usage during a pandemic, could lead to exploring particular contents (pornography) as well activities (social networks, games). The aforementioned could negatively reflect on important mental health factors in daily living such as quality of life or insomnia.Aim: The aim of our study was to investigate if quality of life and sleep during the pandemic are predicted by Internet-related variables such as the general use of Internet. Methods and methods: This cross-sectional study is a part of a wider international multicenter research. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of the Clinical Centre of Serbia and the Board of Clinic of Psychiatry, Clinical Centre of Serbia. The study included 3330 participants (71.1% females, average age was 40.78 Â±12.21 years). The participants filled in an anonymous online self-report questionnaire, comprising the following: 1) socio-demographic questionnaire;2) questionnaire on Internet use during the pandemic (designed for the purpose of this study), assessing whether participants had more frequent use of Internet, and performed any of the online activities more (e.g. playing online games, using Instagram, Facebook (FB)), or browsed any of the Internet contents more (e.g. sexual contents) during the pandemic;3) the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI);4) the COVID-19 - Impact on Quality of Life (COV19-QoL) scale. Multivariate liner regression was used to produce two models, with COV19-QoL during the pandemic and the ISI score as outcomes, and Internet-related variables as predictors, controlling for gender, age, and the number of persons living in the household. Results: Both linear regression models were significant, explaining about 6% of variance each. Worse QoL during the pandemic was predicted by more time on Internet during the pandemic, more frequent gaming, FB use, and searching for sexual content, whereas the more frequent use of Instagram had no predictive effect. Higher insomnia severity was predicted by more time spent on Internet during the pandemic, and more frequent search for sexual content, while other Internet-related variables had no predictive effects. Conclusions: The findings of this study speak in favor of the negative association between the general and specific use of Internet on side, and the quality of life and sleep during the pandemic, on the other. These findings may have important implication for both prevention and further research.

"Loneliness, coping, suicidal thoughts and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic: a repeat cross-sectional UK population survey","ObjectivesThere has been speculation on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdown on suicidal thoughts and self-harm and the factors associated with any change. We aimed to assess the effects and change in effects of risk factors including loneliness and coping, as well as pre-existing mental health conditions on suicidal thoughts and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic.DesignThis study was a repeated cross-sectional online population-based survey.Participants and measuresNon-probability quota sampling was adopted on the UK adult population and four waves of data were analysed during the pandemic (17 March 2020 to 29 May 2020). Outcomes were suicidal thoughts and self-harm associated with the pandemic while loneliness, coping, pre-existing mental health conditions, employment status and demographics were covariates. We ran binomial regressions to evaluate the adjusted risks of the studied covariates as well as the changes in effects over time.ResultsThe proportion of individuals who felt lonely increased sharply from 9.8% to 23.9% after the UK lockdown began. Young people (aged 18â€“24 years), females, students, those who were unemployed and individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions were more likely to report feeling lonely and not coping well. 7.7%â€“10.0% and 1.9%â€“2.2% of respondents reported having suicidal thoughts and self-harm associated with the pandemic respectively throughout the period studied. Results from cross-tabulation and adjusted regression analyses showed young adults, coping poorly and with pre-existing mental health conditions were significantly associated with suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Loneliness was significantly associated with suicidal thoughts but not self-harm.ConclusionsThe association between suicidality, loneliness and coping was evident in young people during the early stages of the pandemic. Developing effective interventions designed and coproduced to address loneliness and promote coping strategies during prolonged social isolation may promote mental health and help mitigate suicidal thoughts and self-harm associated with the pandemic.","John, Ann, Sze Chim, Lee, Solomon, Susan, Crepaz-Keay, David, McDaid, Shari, Morton, Alec, Davidson, Gavin, Tine Van, Bortel, Kousoulis, Antonis A.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048123","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25068,""
"Increased self-immolation frequency and severity during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To determine whether the increased restrictions, isolation and stressors associated with COVID-19 led to an increase in rates or severity of self-immolation burn injuries.

"P0187 Impact of covid-19 pandemic on sleep quality in students and employees","Introduction: Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are experiencing severe mental distress [1]. Thus, during the last year, drastic changes occurred in everyday life of every human being. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns (loneliness, anxiety, depression, or insomnia) have developed [2]. Aims: The objective of this study was to explore the sleep quality in students and employees, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data collection occurred between February and March 2021. The online survey included questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19 status, and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) [3]. Snowball sampling was conducted to recruit participants and the survey was shared through social media networking. 620 responses were validated. The analysis was carried out using SPSS Statistics. The Chi-Square test, the corresponding corrections (when the criteria were not met - Likelihood ratio, Fisher test) and Phi and Cramer V parameters were used to verify the interval combinations;the t-independent test with the reporting of the degrees of release, the difference of the means, the Levene's test for the homogeneity test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests for the subgroups under 30 respondents and the confidence interval set at 95%. Results: 74.8% of the respondents were female and most of them were young adults (18 and 35 years - 82.4%). 53.4% were students, while 46.6% were employees. 91.8% lived in urban areas. The average working hours per week was 20-40 hours (32.9%). Regarding COVID-19 disease, 16% were infected, of which 65% had a mild form. Women reported more frequent by impairment of total sleep duration (p=0.032, df=3, Phi=0.119, moderate correlation) and overall poorer quality of sleep (p=0.042, df=3, Phi=0.115, moderate correlation). AIS scores were significantly higher for women, (Mean Differences-1,027: women's mean score=6.39, menâ€™ s mean score =5.37), p=0.007. The frequency of awakenings during night increase with age (p&lt;0.001, df=6, Phi=0.248, strong correlation), as well as awakenings earlier than the desired time (p=0.004, df=6, Phi=0.202, strong correlation). Drowsiness during the day is more prevalent at younger ages (p&lt;0.001, df=6, Phi=0.251, large association). In student population, the sleep induction is more affected (p=0.013, df=3, Phi=0.132, moderate association). Also, the perception of physical and mental functioning (p&lt;0.001, df=3, Phi=0.206, strong association) and sleepiness during daytime (p&lt;0.001, df=3, Phi=0.189, strong association) are more prevalent. In contrast, awakenings during the night are more prevalent among employees (p&lt;0.001, df=3, Phi=0.185, strong association). The final awakening was found to be earlier than desired (p=0.002, df=3, Phi=0.155, strong association). Overall, the AIS results are not significant by different between groups (p=0.140, df=1). Conclusion: Students have experienced more frequently next day consequences of insomnia, while for workers awakenings during the night and early morning awakening were more prevalent. Regarding sociodemographic factors, AIS score was significantly higher among women and awakenings during the night were a sleep disturbance associated with ageing. This online survey suffers from two methodological limitations: limited access to certain portals, and participation biases (respondents may select themselves into the sample), thus more research on insomnia during a pandemic crisis is necessary.

"Does The Lockdown Due To Covid-19 Pandemic Affect The Lifestyle And Disease Activity Of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease?","Background: In December Of 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Emerged In Wuhan. The Government Of Japan Declared A â€œState Of Emergencyâ€ On April 16, 2020. Although This Approach Was Partially Successful For Temporarily Stopping The Spread, Concerns Were Raised Regarding The Negative Impact Of These Measures, Not Only In Terms Of Economics, But Also In Terms Of Mental And Physical Health, Such As Anxiety And Depression. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (Ibd) Are Intestinal Disorders Affected By Environmental Factors, Such As Sleep, Stress, Diet, And Smoking. Therefore, This Study Aimed To Assess The Effects Of The Covid-19 Pandemic And State Of Emergency On The Lifestyle And Disease Activity Of Patients With Ibd. Methods: We Conducted A Questionnaire Survey In Ibd Patients With Regular Follow-Up At Osaka City University Hospital In Japan, From June 16 To August 21, 2020. The Questionnaire Included Questions Regarding The Patientâ€™S Epidemiological History Of Covid-19, Demographic Data, Gastrointestinal Symptoms, Lifestyle Changes And Stress Related To The State Of Emergency, And Current Medication Use. Gastrointestinal Symptoms Were Assessed Before And During The State Of Emergency Using The 6-Point Mayo Score9 And Patient-Reported Outcome 2 (Pro2) Score10 For Ulcerative Colitis (Uc) And Crohnâ€™S Disease (Cd), Respectively. Results: Overall, 451 Patients Completed The Survey. Patients With Exacerbated Uc Tended Have Younger Age, Less Sleep, And More Stress Against Covid-19 Than Did Patients With Non-Exacerbated Uc. Figure 1 Summarizes The Lifestyle Changes And Stress Related To The State Of Emergency. Patients With Exacerbated Uc Tended Have Younger Age, Less Sleep, And More Stress Against Covid-19 Than Did Patients With Non-Exacerbated Uc. Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis Identified Younger Age (Odds Ratio [Or] 1.020, 95% Confidence Interval [Ci] 1.010-1.040;P = 0.011), Fewer Sleep Hours (Or 1.320, 95% Ci 1.020-1.720;P = 0.035), And Increased Stress Due To The Covid-19 Pandemic (Or 5.530, 95% Ci 1.650-18.500;P &lt; 0.01) As Independent Risk Factors Associated With Uc Exacerbation During The State Of Emergency. Patients With Exacerbated Cd Had Younger Age At Cd Onset And Had Higher Pro2 Scores Before The State Of Emergency Than Did Patients With Non-Exacerbated Cd. On Multivariate Analysis, Only Younger Age (Or 1.030, 95% Ci 1.010-1.05;P &lt; 0.01) Was Independently Associated With Exacerbation During The State Of Emergency. Conclusions: We Have Showed Data On The Association Between Ibd Activity And Lifestyle Changes / Psychological Stress Due To The State Of Emergency During The Covid-19 Pandemic. This Study Suggests That Improving Sleep Quality And Preventing Psychological Stress Might Be Key In Ibd Management During The Pandemic, Especially In Young Patients.

"Prevalence and risk factors of the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic affects people's psychological well-being as well as their risk of physical complications. Under the circumstance, it is essential to synthesize the existing evidence on psychological consequences with a view to fostering policymaking. Thus, a systematic attempt was compiled to review the Bangladeshi literature related to common mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, and stress) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed using Medline or PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PsyArxiv, MedRxiv, and ResearchGate, between 20 December 2020 and 5 March 2021, followed by predetermined eligibility criteria. The inclusion criteria for this review were observational studies involving at least one mental health problem (i.e. stress, depression, and anxiety) published in peer-reviewed journals or preprint servers in the English language after the inception of the pandemic in Bangladesh. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 47% (95% CI 39â€“55%, I2 = 99.14%), 47% (95% CI 39â€“54%, I2 = 99.78%), and 44% (95% CI 30â€“58%, I2 = 99.36%), respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that students were experiencing a higher rate of depression, anxiety, and stress than general people and healthcare professionals. The associated risk factors of mental health problems were gender, age, residence area, family size, monthly family income, educational status, marital status, physical exercise, smoking, alcohol use, fear of COVID-19, presence of chronic illness, unemployment status, and exposure to COVID-19-related news and social media. This systematic review provides baseline data on the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress across various Bangladeshi cohorts, which are anticipated to be helpful to the respective authorities for implementing cohort-specific mental health strategies.","Hosen, Ismail, al-Mamun, Firoj, Mamun, Mohammed A.","https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2021.49","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Global Mental Health; 8, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25074,""
"75 Accesstoeducation and support for adults with cystic fibrosis byvirtual support group with a focus on readiness for lung transplant","Background: The CF team at Long Island Jewish Medical Center (LIJMC) of Northwell Health identified deficits among adults with CF related to emotional support and lack of knowledge about lung transplant. To increase patient access to CF-specific support and provide opportunities to address lung transplant with health care experts, we developed a live webbased support group for adults with CF. We analyzed CF patients' knowledge gained and mental health factors following support group participation. Methods: A 10-session live education support group was offered to patients of LIJMC Adult CF Centeren compassing interactive discussions and shared experiences with health care experts and moderated by a CF social worker. Sessions occurred from May to October 2020, were 60-minutes long, and held virtually to adhere to CF and COVID-19 infection control guidelines. We conducted 6 open-dialogue and 4 education sessions, including lung transplant referral and evaluation, mental health, and nutrition. The CF team collaborated with the Columbia University Medical Center transplant team to discuss the lung transplant evaluation process. Baseline and pre- and post-session knowledge and needs assessments were collected using content-based testing, GAD7, PHQ9, and COVID-19 Impact Scale. Participants evaluated the support group upon conclusion of the program. All sessions were audio recorded and transcribed for content analysis. Results: Nine CF adults enrolled in the support group program. Baseline assessments demonstrated a need for support, education and social interaction (Table 1). Following participation, lung transplant knowledge and anxiety, depression, and loneliness scores improved. Participants found the support group to be a helpful and positive experience, stating for example, â€œYou are the first people I've ever met who had CF,â€ and â€œ[lung transplant] acceptance isn't easy, but I mean, when you're sick, what are your alternatives? What is the best way to live?â€. (Table presented.) Conclusion: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, people with CF potentially face further social isolation. A virtual education support group moderated by a CF social worker serves as an effective resource to meet CF patients' need for support, education, and connection with others with CF.","Henthorne, K.; Basile, M.; Marziliano, A.; Wong, K.; Polo, J.; Tsang, D.; LaVecchia, G.; Frantzen, T.; Hajizadeh, N.; Arcasoy, S.; Kim, H.; Wang, J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1569-1993(21)01500-9","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S37-S38, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25075,""
"P0011 Factors affecting alcohol use during COVID-19 lockdown: a critical review","Background: Research has shown that individuals have applied a variety of measures to cope with the negative effects of self-isolation during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns. These coping strategies are not always beneficial and can have adverse effects on psychological wellbeing and health. To cope with the negative effects of the lockdown, individuals may engage in unhealthy behaviors, including increased use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, either as a result of loneliness and despair, or in the hope that this will help them handle lockdown-related stress and mood changes. Objective: The purpose of this literature review was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on alcohol consumption, and to identify possible moderating factors. Methods: A literature search was conducted (April 15, 2021) to identify studies that investigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on alcohol consumption. PubMed was searched using the search terms â€˜alcoholâ€™ and â€˜COVID-19â€™, and cross-References were checked. Articles were included if they were written in the English language and provided data on alcohol consumption (quantity and/or frequency) during COVID-19 lockdowns. Results: A total of 31 studies were included in the review, including a total of 94.630 participants. Most studies were retrospective surveys investigating convenience samples, and originated from Europe (11), the USA (14), Australia (3), China (1), or mixed countries (2). Mixed results were presented by studies that examined their sample as a whole. That is, some studies reported an increase in alcohol consumption, whereas others found a decrease, or unchanged drinking behavior. More detailed analysis revealed subgroups within studied populations. These subgroups reported either increased alcohol consumption (about 25%), decreased alcohol consumption (about 25%), or did not change their alcohol consumption during COVID-19 lockdown (about 50%). Factors influencing the direction of change in alcohol consumption included various demographic characteristics such as sex, age, race, educational level, living situation, and employment status. Important moderating factors are negative mood changes experienced during lockdown, such as stress, loneliness, and depression. The amount of associated stress and (in-)capability of successfully coping with stress showed to be an important determinant of alcohol intake. Greater mood changes were associated with an increased likelihood of drinkers changing their drinking behavior. This could be either a reduction in alcohol intake in order to maintain an adequate health status, or an increase in alcohol consumption as a mechanism to cope with stress and loneliness. The latter is associated with subsequent poorer health and an increased susceptibility to experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: These findings show that the COVID-19 lockdown has varying effects on alcohol consumption. About half of the individuals do not change or reduce their alcohol intake during the lockdown. However, a substantial number of individuals (about 1 in 4 drinkers) reported increased alcohol consumption during lockdown, which was associated with negative mood, increased stress, poorer health, and increased susceptibility to experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.

"P0117 Living alone or together during lockdown: differences in mood, perceived immune fitness and experiencing covid-19 symptoms","Background: The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns have been associated with significant increases in negative mood and stress, reduced (perceived) health and poorer quality of life [1]. These effects were particularly seen among people who live alone and lack daily social support of family or housemates. Objective: To compare mood and stress of those that lived alone or together with others during the COVID-19 lockdown, and to investigate the impact on perceived immune fitness and presence and severity of COVID-19 related symptoms. Methods: An online survey among Dutch adults compared the period before the lockdown (15 Januaryâ€“14 March 2020) with the lockdown period (15 Marchâ€“11 May 2020) [2]. Participants indicated whether they â€˜lived aloneâ€™ or â€˜together with othersâ€™ during the lockdown. Mood (â€œanxietyâ€, â€œdepressionâ€, â€œfatigueâ€, â€œhostilityâ€, â€œlonelinessâ€ and â€œhappiness) and â€œstressâ€ was assessed via 1-item scales [3]. Perceived immune fitness and quality of life was measured using a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) [3,4]. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms was assessed using the COVID-19 Symptoms Scale [2]. Items could be rated as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). The sum score served as severity score, and the number of items with a score &gt; 0 as COVID-19 symptom presence score. Differences between outcomes of the groups that lived alone or lived together during lockdown were compared with Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U tests. For each variable, difference scores (<U+0394>, lockdown â€“ before lockdown) were calculated and compared between the groups with analysis of variance. Pearson's correlations were calculated between difference scores. Results: Data of N=505 participants were analyzed. The mean (SD) age was 38.2 (15.8), and 65.5% of the sample were female. During the lockdown period, 115 (22.8%) lived alone and 390 (77.2%) lived together with others. The mean (SD) number of household members was 2.8 (1.6), with a range of 1 to 12. During the lockdown, individuals that lived alone reported significantly higher ratings (p&lt;0.05) of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and significantly lower scores on happiness and quality of life compared to the group that lived together with others. Comparing difference scores (during lockdown â€“ before lockdown) of both groups revealed that the group that lived alone reported a significant greater increase in loneliness (p=0.002), which was accompanied by a significant increase in reported COVID-19 symptoms (presence: p=0.019, severity: p=0.041), whereas a small decrease in symptom presence and severity was seen among the â€˜lived togetherâ€™ group. The <U+0394> loneliness scores correlated significantly with <U+0394> perceived immune fitness (r = -0.239, p&lt;0.0001) and <U+0394> presence (r = 0.144, p=0.001) and <U+0394> severity (r = 0.160, p&lt;0.0001) of COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: Living alone and associated feelings of loneliness have a negative impact on mood, perceived immune fitness, and the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Loneliness is an important determinant of mental health, though often underestimated. Future research should investigate how the impact of increased social support, for example with the aid of mobile technology, can counteract loneliness and thereby improve health and quality of life.

"A Phenomenological Study on the Lived Experiences of Patients Recovered from COVID-19","Purpose: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the lived experiences of patients recovering from Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Using a purposive sampling method, participants were recruited from the Korean Psychological Association's Mental Health and Wellness Center in G city, South Korea, from May 5 to December 30, 2020. The interviews were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. Data saturation was reached after interviewing 14 participants. Results: The experiences of patients recovering from COVID-19 were clustered into 4 main themes and 10 subthemes:, namely, the patients' 1) stigmatization, leading to anxiety, fatigue, and concern about neighbors;2) negative emotions: anger and helplessness;3) coping strategies under pressure: increased gratitude, self-reflection, and self-efficacy;and 4) ways of overcoming internalized stigma: personal growth and hope for the future. Discussion: The results suggest that the positive and negative emotions of patients recovering from COVID-19 are interwoven and coexist against the background of the pandemic. Improvement of social networks, development of coping skills, and psychological growth play an important role in alleviating the psychological burden of recovering patients.","Hee Sook, Kim, Jae Wan, Park","https://doi.org/10.7475/kjan.2021.33.6.556","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Korean Journal of Adult Nursing; 33(6):556-564, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25078,""
"Loneliness and Social Isolation in Older Adults: The Effects of a Pandemic","Purpose: This clinical focus article examines the effect of social isolation and loneliness forced by the pandemic on the geriatric population. Since March 11, 2020, when a global pandemic was declared, a new concept of social distancing has swept the United States and the world. While these efforts have been challenging for the entire population, there has been a disproportionate effect on minority groups, low-income communities, and one especially vulnerable group that has emerged: older adults. Method: A review of existing scientific research on social isolation and loneliness in the aging population was conducted. Current demographic data on the aging population were gathered to determine clinical applicability of research evidence. Principles of bioethics were considered within a risk/benefit assessment related to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Social determinants of health were examined within the context of the pandemic. Results: Research supports the link between social isolation, loneliness, and negative outcomes in older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of these negative effects, including anxiety/depression, neuroinflammation, substance abuse, physical or nutritional deficits, and a decline in overall health. Conclusion: Strategies to mitigate the negative effects of social isolation may include technological intervention, attendance at virtual events, socially distanced outdoor activities, family connection, and cognitive stimulation or leisure tasks.","Heape, Amber","https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_persp-21-00107","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups; 6(6):1729-1736, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25079,""
"Depressive symptoms and psychological distress from antenatal to postnatal period in women with high-risk pregnancy: A prospective study during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on mental disorders in postnatal period remains unknown. Aim: The study aimed to determine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may aggravate depressive symptoms and psychological distress of women with high-risk pregnancy in postnatal period. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on women with complicated pregnancies from antenatal to postnatal period. In the first phase, from December 2019 to January 2020 (before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic), 122 pregnant women filled in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Brief Symptom Inventory 53-items (BSI-53). In the second phase, with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic from February to June, 30% of the participants (41/122) completed three questionnaires: EPDS, BSI-53, and the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scale in postpartum period. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, from antenatal to postnatal period, the depression score of EPDS, total scores, all the subscales of BSI-53, and global severity index-53 increased in women with high-risk pregnancy. Furthermore, the persistence of antenatal depression occurred in 85.7% of the participants, and the onset of postnatal depression occurred in 80% of them. About 12% of the women also experienced PTSD symptoms during the postnatal period. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic may aggravate the prevalence and persistence of postnatal depression in women with high-risk pregnancy. The study calls for clinical implementation to identify and help women with mental disorders in postnatal period, especially women experiencing complicated pregnancies.","Hamidia, Angela, Kheirkhah, Farzan, Faramarzi, Mahbobeh, Basirat, Zahra, Ghadimi, Reza, Chehrazi, Mohammad, Barat, Shahnaz, Cuijpers, Pim, O'Connor, Elizabeth, Mirtabar, Seyyedeh","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_1272_20","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 63(6):536-542, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25080,""

"PR49 PANDEMIC AND ITS IMPACT ON ABC/MBC PATIENTS","COVID-19 attacked the world suddenly. Govts started groping for ways and means to protect their people. Till recently, ABC/ MBC patients had to take a back seat. Health care system had to be restructured, reorganized;resources had to be diverted to accommodate huge influx of COVID patients. ABC is incurable. The treatment of ABC aims at arresting the spread of cancer and treating the symptoms of ABC, its treatment to improve QoL and prolong the patient's life. But we see no signs of its ending. We have to adapt to the new normal life. Public HC system was unable to cater services. Suspected EBC patients turned into ABC as they could not get treatment in time. There were no community cancer screenings. Delay or cancellation for the dates of chemo etc. turned EBC into ABC. New patient registration fell by 54% and outclinic visits by 46%. ABC issues: Emotional - patients felt fear, hopelessness, depression, anxiety. Due to low immunity, they are prone to COVID-19. No treatment would spread cancer. Myths spread by social media add to their anxiety. Going to the hospital means problem of transportation due to lockdown/OPD's might be closed. Financially people are losing their jobs or getting less salary. Hardly any NGOs help ABC patients. Government is concentrating more on COVID treatment. HCPs being busy with COVID-19, few doctors are left for ABC patients. These patients are prone to decreased platelet counts Today there are hardly any blood donors. Socially people do not come forward to help. Many times there is unavailability of drugs. Gradually medical fraternity is finding new methods of treating ABC patients. Tele consultation/medicine is introduced. Patients can get drugs at their native place and receive chemo in some local hospital. Government started issuing travel permission cards to the needy patients and caregivers. Many precautions like PPE etc. have been introduced in hospitals. Online appointments save patients' unnecessary travel. But illiterate patients are not tech savvy. Patients are educated through social media etc. to have a positive attitude and keep busy meaningfully. ICS, Delhi has been working for breast cancer since1983.It has started interacting with ABC patients since 2016 with an aim to understand their issues. ICS has a WhatsApp group of BC patients and survivors. Many of these are ABC patients. Amazingly it is these patients who motivate other patients. A few of ICS counseled ABC patients have learnt to create awareness about BC. They are extensively creating awareness in their own regions, thus saving many women's lives. Their mission is to save others from becoming ABC. They feel confident, useful and positive. It improves their QoL. Also, ICS volunteers attended a workshop on patient engagement panels for ABC patients. These volunteers also attended Peer Navigation Training with respect to ABC A project on ABC is in the pipeline, where ICS has collaborated with a renowned BC surgeon.","Gulabani, C.

"Analyzing a community workerâ€™s stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","PurposeCommunity governance plays an important role in the prevention and control of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China. Community workers, the main executors in community governance, experience a huge amount of stress, which affects their physical and mental health. Thus, it is crucial to pay more attention to the stressors and stress responses of community workers and propose strategies to alleviate such responses. This paper aims to analyze the work stress of community workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.Design/methodology/approachBased on a questionnaire survey of 602 community workers during COVID-19 in China, the four main stressors and 14 stress factors of community workers were identified and six factors at three levels of stress responses were defined. A stress analysis model is proposed that tests the mediating role of psychological capital and the moderating role of organizational climate.FindingsThe results show that stressors influence stress responses through the moderating role of psychological capital, organizational climate plays a negative mediator role between stressors and psychological capital and the main stressors for community workers are work, safety and performance stress.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to existing research because it offers suggestions for reducing the impact of stress on the community workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it can promote the control and prevention of the COVID-19.","Gui, Ping, Ji, Xiaotong, Yanlan, Mei, Quan, Zhicheng","https://doi.org/10.1108/K-10-2020-0679","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Kybernetes; 51(1):403-422, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25083,""
"Phubberâ€™s Emotional Activations: The Association between PANAS and Phubbing Behavior","Currently, mobile phones are widely used worldwide. Thus, phubbing rapidly became a common phenomenon in our social life. Phubbing is considered by the literature as a new form of technology-related addiction that may undermine interpersonal relationships and mental health. Our study contributed to exploring phubbersâ€™ emotional activation as no other work has investigated it so far. Indeed, researchers have only explored phubbeesâ€™ but not phubbersâ€™ emotional correlates. A sample of 419 Italian individuals (143 males) participated in our data collection on a voluntary basis. The results showed that phubbing is related to negative affects, but not to positive affects. Moreover, phubbing in both its components (i.e., communication disturbance, phone obsession) appeared to elicit an emotional activation similar to that of social media addiction. These findings may help in strengthening the discussion around the emotional consequences of virtual environment design, as well as the awareness about what happens at a relational level during phubbing.","Guazzini, Andrea, Raimondi, Tommaso, Biagini, Benedetta, Bagnoli, Franco, Duradoni, Mirko","https://doi.org/10.3390/fi13120311","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Future Internet; 13(12):311, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25084,""
"P0715 Sleep, stress, burnout, and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers from COVID-19 services: findings from a cross-sectional study on psychosocial risks","Background: Poor management in healthcare institutions can have significant consequences for the workplace and for the physical and mental health of its workers. The exposure to unsustainable pressure and demand can impair the worker's performance and the quality of care provided. Four common issues are sleeping troubles, stress, burnout, and depressive symptoms. Several of these risks were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among healthcare workers working with patients either suspected of, or confirmed, COVID-19 infection. Methods: Using the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) II questionnaire, we aimed to assess the psychosocial risks among a sample of 235 healthcare workers deployed in COVID-19-related services in the Local Health Unit of Baixo Alentejo (Portugal). The participants filled out a questionnaire, which comprised ten sociodemographic questions and the Euro-Portuguese medium version of the COPSOQ II questionnaire. Data collection occurred February 15th-28th 2021. As recommended by the COPSOQ authors, tertiles cut-off points of 33.3 and 66.6 (percentage scale) were used, rendering a traffic light risk classification where green represents a favourable situation, red a health risk and yellow an intermediate risk. [1] The results were processed with qualitative and quantitative descriptive statistical analysis. To compare groups relative to each outcome, t-tests were used for variables with two categories. Whenever data was not normally distributed, Mann-Whitney tests were used. For variables with more than two groups non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis was applied. Bonferroni correction was also applied, testing each individual hypothesis at the level of significance of ai=0.05/29. Note that a statistically significant difference between two groups does not necessarily yield a different risk colour. The mean (and categorial) values of the COPSOQ's sleep, stress, burnout and depressive symptoms domains were also compared to a dataset from a previous assessment (same institution) performed in 2017 [2]. Results: Except for depressive symptoms in the paediatric and general emergency services, domains such as stress, burnout, sleep issues and depressive symptoms showed an intermediate health risk. The burnout domain showed the highest level of risk among nurses and operational assistants working in the Intensive Care Unit. Several associations, with sociodemographic variables, are also discussed, such as a statistically significant association between the burnout domain and the number of hours spent in COVID-19 services, as well as (in medical doctors) time of service with COVID-19 patients, or between stress and age group. Overall, comparing with a similar evaluation made in 2017 [1], depressive symptoms worsened in nurses, slightly ameliorated in medical doctors, while the rest of the four domains remained in the yellow risk category, even though most of them exhibited a numerical aggravation, though not sufficient to change risk category. Conclusions: Working in COVID-19 services can worsen sleep troubles, stress, burnout and depressive symptoms among health care workers. These results support the assessment of psychosocial stressors in healthcare units, to promote risk reduction policies in healthcare workers through workplace reforms. Accessible occupational services, therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies are also crucial. Neuropharmaceuticals may play a role in improving some health hazards in unhealthy workplaces.

"COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit: the emotional experience of family members","Objective This study describes the psychological counseling offered to family members of SARS-CoV-2 patients in an intensive care unit (ICU). The purpose of this study is to describe the emotional burden experienced by families, and describe the first contact and counseling services. Methods Family members of patients admitted to the IRCCS ISMETT COVID-19 ICU were contacted by telephone by the IRCCS ISMETT Clinical Psychology Service. After this first contact, the families who accepted the service were offered periodical counseling by the psychologists. The clinical psychological interview was used to manage and support their emotional burden. The stress thermometer was used as a tool to assess the stress experienced by the family members. who were followed by the psychology team until the patient was discharged or transferred to another hospital, or until his or her death. A follow-up telephone psychological counseling was planned six months after the patient's discharge. Results We contacted 60 family members of patients admitted to the IRCCS ISMETT COVID-19 ICU. Of these, 23 accepted the telephone psychological counseling. The level of perceived stress of family members was high (M 7 DS 1.6). The main cause of distress was described as related to an emotional issue (fear, depression). Family members were encouraged to manage the emotional burden and supported at the time of the patient's discharge or death. Conclusions Our experience with telephone psychological counseling for family members of COVID-19 ICU patients highlights the emotional burden of families and the importance of this service. Our study encourages additional research on the post-traumatic sequelae of family members forced to deal at a distance with the hospitalization of a beloved one, and suggests the need fora patient- and family-centered model of care, even during a pandemic.","Girgenti, R.; Buttafarro, M.

"P0647 Psychological impact in patients with common mental disorders after six months of COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction: Studies focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with psychiatric disorders have reported a deterioration of their mental health due to this situation [1]. A study focused on the early COVID-19 pandemic consequences on mental health found that participants reporting a current mental disorder were experiencing the greatest psychological impact, followed by those reporting a past mental disorder [2]. We hypothesize that having suffered or suffering from a depressive or anxiety disorder at that time can lead to maladaptive responses during the pandemic and social restrictions. Aims of the study: To describe the psychological impact among patients with a current or past diagnosis of Common Mental Disorders (CMD;anxiety and depressive disorders) after six months of the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1. To explore risk and protective factors associated with a Severe Psychological Impact (SPI). Methods: Cross-sectional survey. A self-reported online test was completed by the participants during the pandemic from October 14th to November 8th, 2020, from all over the Spanish territory. From the sample (N=5900), 1122 (19.02%) reported suffering from CMD in the past or at the moment the study was conducted (mean ageÂ±SD=46.01 Â±14.12 years) The Spanish version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to evaluate the maladaptive psychological responses. Psychological impact in CMD was classified according to the number of maladaptive responses in the DASS-21 scale, considering: mild (1 response), moderate (2 responses) and severe (3 responses). Statistical analyses: Chi-square, t-student test (IBM SPSS version 24 was used for data analyses). The p-value was set at &lt;0.05. Results: Women represented 70.1% of the sample. Approximately half of the participants were married or were living with a cohabiting partner (55.8%). Most of the responders had completed university studies (69.6%). From the sample, 1240 participants (21%) had a somatic disease (12% hypertension and 10.8% chronic respiratory disease). 16.1% increased their alcohol consumption and 14.1% increased their tobacco consumption. CMD reported the highest psychological impact on Depressive DASS-21 subscale (59.5% <U+03C7>Â²=206.6, p&lt;0.001), followed by Stress subscale (38.6, <U+03C7>Â²= 482.2, p&lt;0.001) and Anxiety subscale (31.3, <U+03C7>Â²= 204.7, p&lt;0.001). According to copying strategies, a high percentage of patients with CMD reported being able to enjoy leisure time (88.1%). Reading or listening to music were the most frequent activities (87.8%). 20.7% of the sample showed a SPI. Considering the statistically significant variables, a logistic regression analysis was obtained. On the one hand, older age (B=-0.03, OR=0.972, p&lt;0.001), male sex (B=-0.6, OR=0.55, p=0.008), university studies (B=-0.43, OR=0.652, p=0.008) and being able to enjoy leisure time (B=-1.1, OR=0.341, p&lt;0.001) were protective factors of SPI. On the other hand, having a somatic illness (B=0.59, OR=1.797, p&lt;0.001) and the increase in tobacco use (B=0.58, OR=1.778, p=0.005) were factors associated with SPI. Conclusions: This study illustrates the psychological impact in CMD after half-year of the COVID-19 outbreak. Being young, a woman, suffering from somatic illness, and not having a university education are risk factors for SPI. However, being able to enjoy leisure time is the main protective factor against a SPI in CMD. No conflict of interest","Gil, E. M.; MartÃ­nez-Suero, L.; Revuelta, J. R.; SuÃ¡rez, L.

"P0707 Suicide attempt and depression after COVID-19 vaccination: a case report","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental and physical health [1]. Vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are considered to be the most promising approach for the pandemic and are being vigorously pursued [2]. Since the outbreak began, researchers around the world have been trying to develop vaccines for COVID-19, with more than 198 vaccines currently in preclinical or clinical development phase [3]. Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac) is one of the vaccine that has been in use in Turkey. It has been on the market a while now and some adverse effects are defined but many others are waiting to be discovered. This article reports a case of prolonged fatigue, depression, loss of functionality and suicide attempt after the CoronaVac vaccination. The reported patient was 72 years old female and had no background of any psychiatric disorder. The patient was admitted to the emergency service after a suicide attempt by drug overdose. After the patient's observation was completed in the emergency service, psychiatric evaluation was performed. The patient had depressive mood, loss of joy, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, feeling of worthlessness and recurrent suicidal thoughts nearly everyday for a two months period. She received the first dose of CoronaVac vaccination on the 24th of February in 2021. After the first injection she developed nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue and hypertension. A complete examination has been made in another hospital and any organic pathology has not been detected. Because of this symptoms, she was scared to get the second dose of vaccine. Fatigue, and other depressive symptoms increased and got worsened and she made superficial cuts with kitchen knife on the dorsal faces of both her ankles and wrists five days prior to suicide attempt. She took unknown amount of chlorpromazine that expired in 1970 to commit suicide. The patient was admitted to psychiatry clinic and after a treatment process with venlafaxine she discharged with her own will and depressive symptoms were in remission. The psychiatric background has been evaluated for the causes of depression such as recent stressor, trauma, loss of family members, life style changes or anxiety about the pandemic but any specific cause could not be found. In addition during this time the patient was not infected by COVID-19 virus. In previous studies the most common side effects caused by the CoronaVac were mild pain and redness at the injection site and slight fatigue [4]. But this study observed the participants only for 28 days, so prolonged side effects that may be caused by the CoronaVac has not been reported yet. Our patient is the first case reported that developed a fully depressive episode after CoronaVac vaccination. It may guide clinicians in establishing a linkage between prolonged fatigue and depressive symptoms in vaccinated patients. No conflict of interest","Gencan, I. A.; Ã–zacar, B.

"More GP contacts and poorer health of informal caregivers with low socioeconomic status in Germany: results from the population-based DEGS1 and the cross-sectional GPCare-1 study","ObjectivesInformal caregivers are known to have poorer mental health. Risk factors for caregiver burden include low education, female gender, cohabitation with the care recipient and lack of resources. General practitioners (GPs) have an important role in supporting caregivers. Drawing on data from two surveys, associations between caregiversâ€™ socioeconomic status (SES), psychophysical health and GP contacts are analysed.DesignCross-sectional study. The study draws on data from two surveys (German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults, DEGS1 and General Practice Care-1, GPCare-1).SettingGermany.ParticipantsDEGS1: German general population (18+ years) n=7987. GPCare-1: general practice patients (18+ years) n=813.Primary outcomePsychophysical health, GP contacts and communication.MethodsUsing representative DEGS1 data, the prevalence of informal caregivers, caregiversâ€™ burden, chronic stress, various health conditions and frequency of GP contacts were evaluated stratified by SES. Data from the GPCare-1 study addressed caregiversâ€™ experiences and communication preferences with GPs.ResultsIn the DEGS1, the prevalence of caregivers was 6.5%. Compared with non-caregivers, caregivers scored significantly higher for chronic stress (15.45 vs 11.90), self-reported poor health (37.6% vs 23.7%) and GP visits last year (3.95 vs 3.11), while lifestyle and chronic diseases were similar. Compared with caregivers with medium/high SES, those with low SES had a significantly lower prevalence of high/medium caregiver burden (47.9% vs 67.7%) but poorer self-reported health (56.9% vs 33.0%), while other characteristics did not differ. In the GPCare-1 study, the prevalence of caregivers was 12.6%. The majority of them felt that their GP takes their problems seriously (63.6%) without difference by SES.ConclusionCaregivers with low SES constitute an especially high-risk group for psychological strain, requiring special GP attention to support their needs.","Gavrilov, Boris, Schmidt, Manuela, Kasten, Stefanie, Sommer, Samira, Hunzelar, Carmen, Bockheim, Florian, PaÃ±os-Willuhn, Joana, Offenberg, Luisa, Oberholz, Maja, Ikar, Nur, Weltermann, Birgitta","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053146","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25089,""
"VARIATION IN USE OF HIGH-FLOW NASAL CANNULA AND NONINVASIVE VENTILATION IN COVID-19","B Introduction: b Despite critical care guidelines supporting the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with acute respiratory failure from coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), concerns surrounding aerosolization of viral particles, and patient self-inflicted lung injury likely influenced use across hospitals. Among 5311 patients who received HFNC and/or NIV, 2772 (52%) did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation and survived to hospital discharge. B Conclusions: b Hospital variation in use of HFNC and NIV for acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 was large, and was not associated with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or mortality.

"P0619 Personality traits, depression, and stress predispose internet-dependent behavior in university students","Background. Problematic internet use is a growing social issue which is being debated worldwide. During COVID-19-related quarantines, the use of internet has excessively increased [1]. Moreover, internet addiction is considered to be among severe public health issues in the post-pandemic world [2]. Current literature has underlined that both personal and interpersonal variables can lead to a higher risk of internet-dependent behavior among young adults [3, 4]. Students may be particularly vulnerable to internet addiction, as they have unsupervised access to the internet and are responsible for their own time management [2]. A growing body of research has suggested internet addiction to be associated with academic procrastination and lower academic performance, as well as with cognitive and emotional disturbances [5]. Objective. This study was aimed at identifying internet addiction prevalence and factors associated with internet addiction among young adult university students. Method. The total sample included 674 university students (450 men (66.8%), 224 women (33.2%)) aged 18 - 25 years. Internet Addiction Test (IAT), Five-Factor Model (Big Five) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS - 21) questionnaires were employed. Data analysis was performed with t - test. Results. Based on IAT results, 138 university students (21%) showed high rates of internet - dependent behavior. Subsequent intergroup comparison (internet - dependent, n = 138 (98 men (71%), 40 women (29%)) versus ordinary internet users, n = 536) revealed significant between-group differences in personality traits according to Big Five questionnaire and emotional states evaluated with DASS - 21. Particularly, we found that internet-dependent university students have lower rates of extraversion, benevolence, consciousness and openness to experience compared to ordinary internet users (all ps &lt; 0.001). Contrary, internet - dependent university students showed higher rates of neuroticism compared to their ordinary internet-using peers (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, internet - dependent university students have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress evaluated with DASS - 21 (all ps &lt; 0.001). Conclusion. Our results showed 21% internet addiction prevalence rate in young adult university students. Certain levels of Five - Factor personality traits that might predispose young adults to internet addiction development were also found. In addition, higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress which were observed in internet - dependent university students can be both causes and consequences of internet - dependent behavior. We underline that depression, anxiety, and stress associations with internet addiction should be investigated further as both comorbid and premorbid mental health issue. To conclude, it is important to consider high neuroticism, low extraversion, and other traits of young adults at risk for internet - dependent behavior when developing and conducting internet addiction prevention.

"We're not in Kansas anymore: Reimagining a new yellow brick road for treating youth and their families in the peri- and post-pandemic periods","The COVID-19 viral pandemic is a ferocious force savaging millions of lives in its wake. Many experts predict a major mental health aftershock due to the myriad disruptions of daily life. Mental health providers and systems will need to reengineer treatment paradigms and delivery models. This article advocates for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based modular, transdiagnostic, principle-guided, and single-session treatment approaches to be used in integrated pediatric primary care clinics as ways to meet the swelling behavioral health needs of youth and families. The value of integrated pediatric behavioral health and stepped care paradigms is championed. Furthermore, multiple recommendations for practice, training, service delivery, workforce development, public behavioral health literacy, and advocacy in the next normal are described. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement COVID-19 represents an unprecedented public health crisis and is expected to result in large increases in referrals for pediatric behavioral health concerns. Existing mental health practices, procedures, and systems were caught unprepared by the viral outbreak.

"Prediction of emotional exhaustion over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in primary care dental staff: an intensive longitudinal study","ObjectiveTo investigate the fatigue trajectory during a 6-month duration of the COVID-19 pandemic for dental health professionals in primary dental care and for those in training.DesignA longitudinal intensive panel diary was conducted (Julyâ€“December 2020) assessing weekly self-ratings of emotional fatigue.SettingDental care services in Scotland.ParticipantsDental trainees and primary dental care staff (N=53). These data were merged with respondentsâ€™ replies to a cross-sectional baseline survey (Humphris et al). Recruitment was through â€˜Portalâ€™, an online tool administered by National Health Service Education for Scotland. Questback software was employed for data collection.Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe diary questionnaire, consisted of a three-item fatigue scale and, from the baseline survey, three multi-item scales including: preparedness (14 items of the Dental Professional Preparedness for Practice Scale), the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised and depressive symptomatology using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Statistical analysis included estimating the variability of fatigue over the study duration using a multilevel linear growth model. In addition, a path analysis was performed to determine the ability of preparedness and COVID-19 pandemic trauma to predict fatigue trajectories directly, or mediated through depressive symptomatology.ResultsA large variation of fatigue trajectories (p&lt;0.001) was found from staff who completed a mean of 11 weekly uploads of their diary (diary uploads: minimum 4â€“maximum 24). The average slope was positive (standardised estimate=0.13, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.19, p&lt;0.001). Slope variation was modelled successfully from baseline data showing direct and indirect effects from preparedness, trauma and depressive symptoms.ConclusionStaff who volunteered to participate over a significant period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland displayed a highly significant variety of individual trajectories. The results show some consistency with a job demands-resources model of burnout development.

"P0808 Mental health status of medical doctors during COVID-19 epidemic in Ukraine","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic spreading worldwide. Ongoing crisis places additional pressure on the healthcare system, medical staff and affiliated healthcare workers are at-risk population and are under both physical and psychological pressure [1]. A considerable proportion of health workers reported symptoms of depression 50.4%, anxiety 44.6%, insomnia 34.0%, and distress 71.5% in previous studies [2]. The aim of the present study was to identify the possible impact of demographic data and personal variables (age, gender, working position, residence), health condition on anxiety, depression and suicidality rates of in medical doctors facing COVID-19 emergency in comparison with general population. Methods: An online survey was distributed via social media and online professional networks in Ukraine between July and December 2020. Demographic, health and mental health data, current anxiety (The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI-S), depression (Depression Screening, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression, CES-D) and suicidality (Risk Assessment Suicidality Scale, RASS), were registered. Data from 1452 persons were anonymously collected (78.% females;aged 39.1 Â± 13.15 and 21.1% males;aged 38.46Â±15.44). 55.2% were medical staff and affiliated healthcare workers (41.8% (n=607) doctors, 2.7% nurses, 10.7% other staff). 28% medical doctors were from the capital city. Statistical Analysis: A post-stratification method was used;descriptive statistics were calculated. T-tests for independent samples and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Results: 40.2% of doctors reported their emotional state due to the COVID-19 epidemic become worse, and female felt worse than male doctors. 70.7% were having chronic somatic conditions, male doctors had less chronic med conditions than female (56% vs 74%, x2(2) = 14.76, p = 0.001). 83.2% reported no previous mental health issues, some reported anxiety or depressive conditions. But during the eCOVI-19 epidemic 45.4% felt more anxious, 32.9% - more depressed, 30.5% of doctors reported alteration in appetite, they ate more than they used to, 32.4% reported decreased quality of sleep. Employment affected mean scores of STAI-S, CES-D and RASS scales. The mean scores differ and were significantly higher in doctors, compared to non health workers and other medical staff: STAI-S t(1256) =-5.14, p=0.000;CES-D t(1256) =-2.27, p=0.006, due to CES-D depressed affect and somatic complaints t(1256) =-2.18, p=0.02;RASS intention scale t(1256) =-3.8, p=0.000, RASS self harm scale t(1256) =-3.49, p=0.000, RASS history of suicide scale t(1256) =-2.62, p=0.009, RASS total score t(1256) =-7.66, p=0.000. Doctors from the town less than 20.00 inhabitants had the highest depression, anxiety and suicidality rates. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is a new challenge for medical doctors, they appeared to be the most vulnerable population. COVID-19 epidemic caused distress and led to increased levels of anxiety, depressed mood and somatic complaints, as well as suicidality. Intervention strategies to prevent suicidality and to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes are needed.

"QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), COPING, AND RESILIENCY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic puts IBD patients at risk for declines in physical, financial, social, emotional, and occupational function. Varying state guidelines for social distancing complicate the emerging picture of the pandemicâ€™s effects. Little is known about how IBD patients are coping with COVID-19, including the role of resilience in adjustment. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the pandemic across QoL domains and understand how coping strategies and resilience are associated with these outcomes. Methods: Adult patients aged 18+ recruited via an outpatient university-based gastroenterology clinic, research recruitment website, social media. Participants completed an online survey: 1) demographic + disease information 2) COVID-19 COPE Survey, 3) NIH-PROMIS scales for anxiety, depression, fatigue, 4) Brief Resilience Scale. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and Pearsonâ€™s correlations evaluated the sample data. Results: 131 Participants: Mean(SD) age is 44.4 (14.4), 81% female, 91% non-Hispanic white, 76% college educated. 48% Crohnâ€™s disease, 85% using IBD medication, average 2.5(2.4) GI clinic visits in past year, 100% insured. 22% had a COVID-19 test in past month. Only 7% were ever COVID-19+, all were asymptomatic. Only 12.7% stated the pandemic reduced ability to manage IBD yet 24% delayed medical care. While 60% of participants engaged in social distancing, 25% did not adjust behavior. 70% had employment impacts, including 16% not being paid/unemployed due to the pandemic;younger participants were more affected (p=.022). However, 82% reported no financial burdens;only 3% were unable to pay for medications. 56% reported significant fatigue. Those who felt less resilient (r= -0.19, p=.046) or with more work impacts had more fatigue (p=.04). Depression was higher in patients who felt less resilient (r= -0.32, p&lt;.001), consumed more news (p=.04) or had larger financial burdens (p=.03). Increased anxiety occurred in patients who felt less resilient (r= -0.23, p=.01) or used more cannabis (p=.02). The most common unhealthy coping strategy was eating more junk food (30%), followed by increased cannabis (9%) and alcohol (5%) use. Engaging in healthy coping strategies such as reducing news consumption, increasing relaxation, and connecting with others did not yield differences in anxiety, depression, or fatigue. Conclusion: This cohort of IBD patients reports variable impacts of the pandemic across QoL domains. Alarmingly, one quarter of patients did not follow social distancing and an equal proportion delayed medical care. Employment was affected for most without significant financial burdens, and all participants remained insured. Substance use was uncommon. Resilience may be protective for anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Engaging in healthy coping strategies did not yield significant differences across these outcomes.","Fink, M. C.; Simons, M.

"P0338 Chronotype and area-specific deficits in mental health","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a palpable rise in mental health conditions, including greater anxiety, depression and stress. There have been many suggested driving factors for this rise, from unemployment to exposure to negative news. However, during the pandemic there have been both a rise in drug consumption and a shift to a later chronotype. Chronotype is a measure of the timing of an individual's behavioural patterns, with early and late chronotypes being more colloquially known as â€˜early larksâ€™ and â€˜night owlsâ€™ respectively. Later chronotype has often been associated with increased drug consumption and there have not yet been investigations into the influence of these factors on the rise of mental ill-health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the effect of chronotype on mental health in the general public. The Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) was used to assess the chronotype of each participant. The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21) was used to assess mental health. As it is known that drug consumption increases with later chronotype, we then assessed whether increased drug consumption was responsible for these relationships. We used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Revised Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test (CUDIT-R) and the FagerstrÃ¶m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) to quantify alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use respectively. We hypothesised that a later chronotype would be associated with poorer mental health and that total drug consumption would mediate this relationship. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in the Cambridge county area (N=209), with data collection being completed using an online survey. The MCTQ gathers data regarding sleep timing throughout the week, allowing us to generate a mid-sleep time which has been validated as an indicator of chronotype. The DASS21 with its individual subscales allowed us to generate scores for depression, anxiety, stress and overall mental health. We then completed multiple regression analysis to investigate the associations between chronotype and these mental health measures. Mediation pathway analysis was used to examine whether total drug consumption was responsible for the significant associations. Total drug consumption was calculated by summing the scores from the AUDIT, CUDIT-R and the FTND. Results: Multivariate regression analyses revealed that chronotype was significantly associated with overall mental health score (ÃŸ=0.16, p=0.022) and anxiety (ÃŸ=0.18, p=0.009). Chronotype was not significantly associated with depression or stress. Causal mediation analysis showed that overall drug consumption mediated both relationships. Conclusion: The association between later chronotype and poorer mental health is driven by increased anxiety rather than depression or stress. However, these relationships can be explained by the increased drug consumption that occurs in these late chronotypes. These results can inform counselling and future treatments for late chronotypes that focus on reducing their drug consumption. The evidence that anxiety drives the relationship with mental health will also allow healthcare professionals to screen for anxious symptoms to identify those that require interventions more effectively.

"P0431 SARS-CoV-2 neuropsychiatric pathogenic mechanisms â€“ a case report of delirium with psychotic symptoms as sole manifestation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patient","Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which generates a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Fever, gastrointestinal and upper respiratory symptoms are among the most common initial manifestations reported [1]. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms are also frequent, and in some cases, these can remain as sole manifestation of the infection [2]. We report a case of a 53-year-old woman with delirium with psychotic component, concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no other associated symptoms. We aim to discuss the mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 affects the Central Nervous System (CNS), highlighting the heightened possibility of such occurrence, even in the absence of risk factors for neurological disease. Methods: Description of a clinical case and review of the literature on the subject. Results: E., a married 53-year-old woman with no background of medical illness, was brought to the psychiatric emergency room for a case of disorganized behavior with acute onset. Mental state evaluation revealed altered level of conscienciousness, distractibility, incoherent speech, poorly structured persecutory delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations and sleep maintenance insomnia. Clinical history and examination revealed no other neurological as well as gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms or signs. Diagnosis of delirium was confirmed using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) Diagnostic Algorithm. Laboratory investigation revealed leukocytosis and elevation of creatinine-kinase and lactate-dehydrogenase. Electroencephalogram exhibited an unspecific grade 1/5 encephalopathy. No significant changes were found in chest X-ray, brain CT-scan or lumbar puncture. Hospitalization was proposed, aiming diagnostic investigation and clinical stabilization. According to institutional norms at the time, prior screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed, with the RT-PCR test result coming positive. Cerebral spine fluid was not tested for SARS-CoV-2. E. was medicated with olanzapine 5mg id and was discharged eight days later, fully recovered from her neuropsychiatric symptoms, and exhibiting no other clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in the meantime. Conclusions: We report the case of a delirium as a sole manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presence of symptoms such as delusional beliefs and hallucinations should be interpreted as features of delirium manifestation, instead of a SARS-CoV-2-induced psychosis [3]. Direct and indirect mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 CNS disturbance have been proposed in scientific literature, such as neuronal invasion and cytokine storm, respectively [4]. In our case, implication of SARS-CoV-2 in delirium etiology is suggested by the temporal relationship between the two and the absence of other possible causes found for this clinical presentation. E.â€™s absence of risk factors for delirium (such as old age or other medical conditions), as well as the absence of any other symptomatology during the course of this disease, both suggest that SARS-CoV-2 poses a particular risk of CNS damage when compared to other respiratory viruses. Thus, in current pandemic times, the sheer presence of delirium should encourage screening of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in the absence of other symptoms [1]. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the CNS.

"THE UTILIZATION OF MATERNAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN SOUTH SULAWESI, INDONESIA","Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the utilization of healthcare services for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Design: An analytical cross-sectional study. Methods: A group of 226 pregnant women completed the study questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed based on the basic health research questionnaire from the Ministry of Health, Indonesia, and the Navigating Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic article from UNICEF. Results: Of the 226 pregnant women, 122 (54%) had poor knowledge related to COVID-19 and negative attitudes regarding health protocols for COVID-19 (79.6%). Most (n = 189;83.6%) experienced anxiety;however, this did not affect their intention to use healthcare services. Utilization of antenatal care services during the pandemic was associated with antenatal care visiting behavior (p = 0.000) and access to healthcare services (p = 0.000). The most significant predictor of utilization of antenatal care services during the pandemic was antenatal care visiting behavior (p = 0.002;OR = 5.904).

"P0640 Factors influencing changes in anxiety during the COVID-19 related lockdown: modifiable targets for prevention and intervention","Introduction Besides neuropsychiatric effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pandemic has a severe negative psychological impact, with a high risk of development or worsening of mental disorders due to stress associated with public health measures, lockdown, and isolation, which significantly contribute to anxiety. Thus, identification of risk and protective factors is of key importance to prevent development of disorders, decrease suffering and burden on the healthcare system. Our aim was to analyze factors contributing to self-reported changes in anxiety during the COVID-lockdown. Methods: As part of a 42-country international collaboration effort to assess changes in subjective mental well-being during the pandemic-related lockdown, our present analysis included data from 763 Hungarian adults recruited using a snowball method, who provided demographic and health-related data including psychiatric and medical history and presence of chronic somatic problems, and completed self-report questionnaires evaluating depression (CES-D), anxiety (STAI), suicidal behavior, subjective changes in psychological symptoms, maintenance of daily routine, lifestyle changes including physical activity, sleep, eating and nutrition, degree of lock-up, changes in the frequency and quality of family relationships, being a caretaker of someone from a vulnerable group, fear of contracting the virus or of family member contracting the virus, belief in the effectiveness of precautions, beliefs in conspiracy theories related to the pandemic, financial state, and several work and profession-related variables. Analyses included binary logistic regression models and <U+03C7>2-square tests. Results: History of anxiety disorders (<U+03C7>2 (2) = 8.091, p = 0.017) but not of depression (<U+03C7>2 (2) = 0.762 p = 0.683) increased likelihood of experiencing subjective increase in anxiety during the pandemic-related lockdown. Protective factors predicting no change or improvement of subjective anxiety vs worsening included good general health (OR: 1.241, Wald's <U+03C7>2=5.294, p=0.021), a higher degree of maintained daily routine (OR: 1.377, Wald's <U+03C7>2=11.321, p=0.001), and no history of anxiety disorders (OR: 1.757, Wald's <U+03C7>2=3.895, p=0.048), while risk factors included a higher degree of lock-up (OR: 0.766, Wald's <U+03C7>2=5.049, p=0.025), decline in the quality of family relationships (OR: 0.245, Wald's <U+03C7>2=7.794, p=0.005), increased fear of contracting the coronavirus (OR: 0.525, Wald's <U+03C7>2=35.544, p &lt;0.0001) or of a family member contracting the virus (OR: 0.781, Wald's <U+03C7>2=7.491, p=0.006), as well as a disbelief in the effectiveness of precautions (OR: 0.698, Wald's <U+03C7>2=4.001, p=0.045). Our model explained 26.3% of the variance observed in subjective changes of anxiety level with a 68.3% model accuracy (<U+03C7>2 (19) = 167.002;p &lt; 0.0001;R2: 0.263). Conclusions: Besides the acute and post-infection neuropsychiatric effects of SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic-related lockdown may also cause severe psychological distress and symptoms. Our study identified multiple factors influencing lockdown-related subjective changes in anxiety acting either as risk or protective factors, the majority of which are modifiable and can be targeted with information, psychoeducation or low-threshold intervention or preventive efforts. Identifying and modifying such factors and their impact, besides decreasing subjective suffering and the risk of development of worsening of psychiatric disorders, also decreases burden on the healthcare system.

"P0413 Modifiable risk and protective factors influencing changes in subjective depression during the COVID-19-lockdown: identifying targets for prevention and intervention","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequential public health measures exert an enormous psychosocial impact, leading to the precipitation or worsening of psychological symptoms and psychiatric disorders. Given the numbers affected, and also the psychiatric consequences of the virus and infection including post-covid symptoms, alleviating the psychological consequences of the lockdown would significantly decrease subjective suffering and healthcare burden. Our aim was to investigate protective and risk factors of pandemic lockdown-related subjective changes in depression in a general population sample as part of a large international 42-country collaboration. Methods: As part of a large international study in 42 countries, 763 Hungarian adults recruited using a snowball method provided demographic and health data and completed online questionnaires evaluating depression (CES-D) anxiety (STAI) as well as their self-reported changes, impact on lifestyle (including physical activity, sleep, eating, daily routines), changes in subjective experiences, use of alcohol, tobacco and psychotropic agents, internet and social media, religion and spirituality, and beliefs related to the pandemic and its origin as well as pandemic-related conspiracy theories during the lockdown. In the present analyses we focused on factors influencing self-reported changes in depression using a binary logistic regression model and <U+03C7>2-square tests, including age, sex, history of anxiety/mood disorders, presence of chronic somatic problems, health, degree of lock-up, maintenance of daily routine, change in the characteristics of family relationships and contacts, fears related to the virus, beliefs related to the precautions and their effectiveness, financial state, and work and profession-related factors. Results: Proportion of those reporting a subjective worsening of depression did not differ between those with or without history of depression (<U+03C7>2 (2) = 4.586, p= 0.101), or with or without history of anxiety disorders (<U+03C7>2 (2) = 4.527, p = 0.104). Several factors significantly influenced likelihood of no change/improvement vs worsening of subjective depression. Protective factors included preserved or improved general health (OR: 1.389, Wald's <U+03C7>2=11.357), and maintaining daily routine (OR: 1.625, Wald's <U+03C7>2=25.295, p=0.001), while risk factors included a negative change in family relationships (OR: 0.221, Wald's <U+03C7>2=12.508, p&lt;0.0001), increased fear of contracting the coronavirus (OR: 0.743B, Wald's <U+03C7>2=7.176, p=0.007,) and decline in one's financial status (OR: 0.592, Wald's <U+03C7>2=8.579, p=0.003). Our model explained 19.9 % of the variance in subjective changes of mood with a 74% model accuracy for case classification (<U+03C7>2 (19) = 115.744;p &lt; 0.0001;R2: 0.199). Conclusion: We identified several factors impacting subjective mood changes as a consequence of the pandemic-related lockdown, including general health, maintaining daily routine, quality of family relationships;fear of contracting the virus and a stable financial state, with history of depression or anxiety having no effect. It is noteworthy that the majority of factors which increased risk of or protect against subjective worsening of depression are modifiable factors and can be addressed by psychoeducation, information, or low threshold interventions, thus decreasing not only subjective suffering and the risk of emergence of more severe psychological symptoms, but also the burden on healthcare.

"ASSESSING THE REPERCUSSIONS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PHYSICAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE","Background and Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges in safely and effectively caring for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). In this study, we surveyed patients with IBD to highlight the impact of the pandemic on their well-being, IBD symptoms and treatment. Methods: In a multi-site survey, 75 questions were administered to patients with IBD from June 26 to September 19, 2020. We evaluated patientsâ€™ symptoms during the pandemic, medication changes, and the likelihood for in-person medical care. We also assessed sleep patterns, stress level, and patientsâ€™ feelings of vulnerability. Sensitivity analyses were done to outline the differences between participants based on their age (younger vs. older than 50-year-old), gender, history of anxiety, history of depression, and if the patient was COVID-19. Logistic, ordinal, and linear regression models were utilized to perform sensitivity analyses. Results: Of 391 surveyed patients, 21.1% reported worsened gastrointestinal symptoms the start of the pandemic. Regarding IBD management,17.5% reported changing biologic medication infusion schedule,18.7% reported medication changes, and 30.3% reported postponing IBD-related laboratory tests. Additionally, 16.5% reported a less healthy feeling more vulnerable than before the pandemic. The survey responses are summarized in figures 1 and 2. Female patients and patients with anxiety and depression tend to have worse outcomes regarding symptoms, IBD management, daily functioning, and emotional well-being. Conclusion: This study demonstrates significant associations between gender, anxiety, and depression with the ability to cope with the evolving COVID 19 pandemic. With this information, it would be feasible to identify those patients with underlying anxiety or depression to better tailor outreach and follow up to support these patients.(figure presented) (figure presented)","El-Dallal, M.; Saroufim, A.; Systrom, H.; Ballou, S.; Cheifetz, A.

"STRATIFYING THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING OF PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE","Background and Aims: Psychological stress is a known risk factor for relapse and worsening symptoms for patients with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and could negatively affect the disease course. The COVID-19 pandemic has created ongoing distress since it started at the end of 2019. In this study, we utilized the Pandemic Emotional Impact Scale (PEIS) to stratify patients with IBD who have been impacted in terms of their well-being and IBD management.Methods: In a multi-center survey study, a 75-item questionnaire, that incorporated the PEIS, was administered to patients with IBD from June 26 to September 19, 2020. The PEIS was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and consists of 16 questions that assess the emotional impact of the pandemic. Each of 16 items are scored on a 0-4 scale (0=â€œNot at allâ€, 1=â€œA little bitâ€, 2=â€œModeratelyâ€, 3=â€œA lotâ€ and 4=â€œExtremelyâ€) with the total PEIS score ranging between 0 to 64. Wilcoxon rank sum test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to examine the association between the PEIS and measures of emotional well-being (sleep patterns, stress level, and vulnerability), changes in IBD symptoms, and the likelihood of IBD patients to visit medical facilities after the reopening. Results: Most of the patients chose to answer â€œNot at allâ€, â€œA little bitâ€, and â€œmoderatelyâ€ and were less likely to choose â€œA lotâ€ and â€œExtremelyâ€ in most of the categories (Figure 1). The mean PEIS score for the entire population was 21.16 (95% CI 19.98_22.36). Female patients, patients with anxiety, and patients with depression were noted to have a significantly higher PEIS score than other patients. Using nonparametric testing, high PEIS was significantly associated with poor sleep, feeling more stressed, feeling more vulnerable, and worsening GI symptoms (abdominal pain and bowel habits). Additionally, PEIS score was significantly higher in patients who reported that they would avoid or be less likely to schedule visits to the GI clinic, GI procedures, or imaging studies after the reopening (Figure 2).Conclusion: Increasing PEIS score was associated with substandard emotional and physical outcomes in patients with IBD. Utilizing the PEIS score as a screening tool could help better tailor outreach and follow-up to support patients with IBD who have been impacted the most.(Table Presented)(Table Presented)","El-Dallal, M.; Saroufim, A.; Systrom, H.; Ballou, S.; Cheifetz, A.

"Comprehensive Nursing Care for COVID-19: It's Effect on Prognosis of Patients with Chronic Diseases","Background: COVID-19 is severe in patients who have chronic diseases as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal and liver diseases, additional cancer, and the risk of mortality rate increases among elderly people. Aim of the study: To evaluate the effect of comprehensive nursing care for COVID-19 on prognosis of patients with chronic diseases. Design: Quasi Experimental design. Setting: The current study was carried out at isolation medical ward for COVID-19 patient (6th floor) at Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt. Subject: Purposive sample of 300 COVID-19 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. They were divided randomly and alternatively into two equal groups 150 in each group: Study group (1): COVID-19 patients who received the hospital routine care and comprehensive nursing care provided by researchers. Control group (2): COVID-19 patients who received only protocol of care provided by the hospital. Tools of the study: Three tools were used to collect the data;as follows: Tool I: Interview questionnaire sheet;it developed by researchers it divided into four parts: Part (1): Sociodemographic data, Part (2): Questionnaire for medical data, Part (3): Laboratory and diagnostic data and Part (4): Clinical manifestation with categories of COVID-19. Tool (II): Chalder fatigue scale. Tool (III): Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the study and control group concerning to the duration of hospitalization, Sao2, vital signs post one week and before patients 'discharge from hospital. There was a statistically significant difference in study group at different intervals related to categories of clinical manifestations, reduction in mean score of fatigue and depression compared to control group post intervention. Recommendations: Integrate comprehensive nursing care in the protocol of care for COVID-19 patients. Establish multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs to determine discharge readiness and needs of patients recovering from Covid-19. Conclusion: Comprehensive nursing care has a positive effect on reducing the length of patients' hospitalization stay and enhanced patients' prognosis.","El Said Hassan El Sol, A.; Elhy, A. H.

"Pharmacologic and Clinical Considerations of Nalmefene, a Long Duration Opioid Antagonist, in Opioid Overdose","Opioid use disorder is a well-established and growing problem in the United States. It is responsible for both psychosocial and physical damage to the affected individuals with a significant mortality rate. Given both the medical and non-medical consequences of this epidemic, it is important to understand the current treatments and approaches to opioid use disorder and acute opioid overdose. Naloxone is a competitive mu-opioid receptor antagonist that is used for the reversal of opioid intoxication. When given intravenously, naloxone has an onset of action of approximately 2 min with a duration of action of 60â€“90 min. Related to its empirical dosing and short duration of action, frequent monitoring of the patient is required so that the effects of opioid toxicity, namely respiratory depression, do not return to wreak havoc. Nalmefene is a pure opioid antagonist structurally similar to naltrexone that can serve as an alternative antidote for reversing respiratory depression associated with acute opioid overdose. Nalmefene is also known as 6-methylene naltrexone. Its main features of interest are its prolonged duration of action that surpasses most opioids and its ability to serve as an antidote for acute opioid overdose. This can be pivotal in reducing healthcare costs, increasing patient satisfaction, and redistributing the time that healthcare staff spend monitoring opioid overdose patients given naloxone.","Edinoff, Amber N.; Nix, Catherine A.; Reed, Tanner D.; Bozner, Elizabeth M.; Alvarez, Mark R.; Fuller, Mitchell C.; Anwar, Fatimah, Cornett, Elyse M.; Kaye, Adam M.; Kaye, Alan D.","https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint2040028","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 2(4):365, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25104,""
"P0798 Acute peritraumatic distress predicts post-traumatic stress disorder at 6 months in patients with bipolar disorder followed during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) are highly vulnerable to stressful events and can experience a wide range of symptoms and emotions in the immediate aftermath of exposure, leading to a later onset of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [1]. Peritraumatic Distress (PD) encompasses several negative physiological, emotional, and cognitive responses that occur immediately after the event, such as: a sense of personal life threat;feelings of fear helplessness and horror;guilt, shame and anger;loss of bowel and bladder control;shaking, trembling, and increased heart rate [2,3]. Increasing studies highlighted that PD may predict the development of PTSD symptoms in subjects exposed to potential traumatic events [4]. However, scant data are still available about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical course of BD [5]. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate PD symptoms related to the COVID-19 emergency in a sample of patients with BD in euthymic phase at the time of the acute phase of the pandemic and their possible correlation with PTSD symptoms emerged within a 6-month follow-up. Methods: Ninety-two patients with BD were enrolled at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Pisa (Italy) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and assessed at baseline (T0) by means of the Impact Event Scale â€“ revised (IES-R), to explore PTSD symptoms, and the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), to investigate PD;the IER-R was submitted again after a 6-month (T1) follow-up. Comparative analyses were performed using Student's t-test for parametric variables. In the case of comparison of categorical variables, chi-squared test was utilized. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the development of PTSD at T1. Results: Thirteen (14.1%) patients with BD reported PTSD symptoms (IES-R score = 24) after a 6-month follow-up. Subjects with PTSD at T1 were more represented by females (92.3% vs. 58.2%, p=0.040) and reported higher IES-R (26.4Â±14.5 vs. 16.2Â±12.2, p=0.008) and PDI (18.8Â±9.4 vs. 11.2Â±7.0, p=0.001) total scores at T0 than subjects without PTSD. Finally, a logistic regression model showed as PDI total scores at T0 was the only factor positively associated to the PTSD development at T1 [b=0.119 (SE=0.056), p=0.033]. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic represents a traumatic experience for individuals exposed to contagion, isolation or social-distancing measures and the dead of a loved one. Our findings suggest that PD related to the acute phase of COVID-19 outbreak could lead patients with a severe psychiatric disorder, such as BD, to be more prone to develop PTSD. Detecting symptomatological post-traumatic stress trajectories by means of clinical longitudinal assessments (including the impact of subjective experience on trauma psychopathology) will be useful for the investigation of possible predictive factors of unfavourable outcome after a traumatic event in BD.

"P0570 Suicide behavior and suicide mortality during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Cantabria (Spain)","Background. Notwithstanding predictions of increase in suicide risk related to the current pandemic [1,2], as was the case in previous pandemics [3], so far there is no clear evidence of increased rates of suicide, self-harm, suicide attempts, or suicidal thoughts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [4]. An increase in suicide deaths after the initial decline in the pandemic ourbreak has been described in Japan [5]. Objective. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on trends in suicide mortality and suicidal behavior (SB) in Cantabria (Spain). Methods. Data collection: suicide mortalities by the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Cantabria (IML) and SB (suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt defined as any self-injurious act with at least some intent to die) by Emergency Department (ED) visits using triage data from the electronic health care records of University Hospital Valdecilla (HUMV, reference hospital for all psychiatric emergencies in Cantabria, Spain). Collection period: January-2015 to December-2020. Data are analyzed in three different COVID-19 pandemic periods (outbreak and lockdown: Marchâ€“June;return to quasi-normality and second wave: July-September;third wave: October-December) compared to those same quarters of the previous five years. Since we exclusively used available aggregate data in this study, formal ethical review was not required. Results. Since 2015, there has been an increasing trend of admissions to the ED of HUMV for SB, having almost tripled between 2015-2019 (88 vs 249). During 2020, visits for SB decreased by more than 30% in comparison with the previous year (173 vs 249). This decline started in March with the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. Previously in the first quarter of the year there were 35% more consultations for SB than 2019. On the contrary, during lockdown (second quarter) SB visits were one third of those in the same period of 2019. Although the third and fourth quarters of 2020 see a doubling of visits compared to the containment period, the number of visits in both quarters is between 60-65% of those in 2019. In 2020, suicides have dropped compared to 2019, both in absolute numbers (46 vs. 52) and rates per-100,000 inhabitants (7.89 vs. 8.95). In the first quarter of 2020 there were 19 suicides (7 more versus 2019), but during lockdown there were only 8 (12 less than in the same period 2019). Conclusions. In Cantabria (Spain), no increase in suicide or SB has been observed related to the pandemic. Conversely, in 2020 we found a decrease in both, consultations for SB and deaths by suicide, compared to 2019. The decrease in suicides and SB has been observed in all periods of Covid-19 pandemic (outbreak and lockdown;quasi-normality and second wave;third wave). Suicide data are difficult to collect in real time and the economic effects of the pandemic are still evolving. Preventive strategies will need to be developed to cope the possible increase in suicide and SB when current social protective measures are discontinued.No conflict of interest","De Santiago-DÃ­az, A.

"Stressors, concerns, and mental health in the early pandemic in South Dakota","This study presents data on psychological functioning, stress, concerns, and attitudes related to Coronovirus disease (COVID-19) during the early phases of the pandemic in a rural Midwestern state. From March 24 to April 14, 2020, South Dakota residents (n = 4,761) reported on their psychological symptoms, pandemic-related stressful experiences, top concerns regarding the pandemic, attitudes toward COVID-19, and social distancing behaviors. Most participants were engaging in at least some social distancing and indicated at least moderate concern about COVID-19. Across age groups, getting sick from the coronavirus was the most frequently endorsed concern. Younger adults endorsed concerns about not being able to work, whereas older adults endorsed concerns about accessing medical care. Greater mental health problems were found for younger adults, racial minorities, and women. Anxiety was prominent among participants concerned about getting sick, whereas both anxiety and depression were relevant for participants with employment concerns. Concerns about health and employment (as well as other concerns) each predicted mental health functioning, even when controlling for other relevant variables. These data provide insight into the specific challenges experienced in a rural state during the early phase of the pandemic.

"Psychological resilience and business survival chances: A study of small firms in the USA during COVID-19","Small firms make huge contributions to the circular economy. However, survival of these firms has been a concern, more so in the context of COVID-19. Hence, it is critical to understand the factors predicting business survival chances of small firms. The present study examines whether ownersâ€™ resilience (a psychological resource) is positively related to small firmsâ€™ business survival chances during the pandemic. We borrowed from the broaden-and-build theory to posit that psychological resilience provides a broadened repertoire of resources which help in coping with depression, leading to higher chances of business survival. Further, using a sample of 657 small firm owners, we investigated if direct and indirect linkages between psychological resilience and business survival chances change with ownersâ€™ experience of financial fragility (i.e., lack of financial resources). Our study carries significant implications for theory and practice.","Chhatwani, Malvika, Mishra, Sushanta Kumar, Varma, Arup, Rai, Himanshu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.12.048","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Business Research; 142:277-286, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25110,""

"P0370 Escitalopram efficacy in post-covid depression treatment: a pilot study","Background. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of depressive symptoms is markedly increased, more than 3-fold higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than before [1]. A significant proportion of post-COVID patients suffer from persistent fatigue, dyspnea, and neuropsychological symptoms [2]. Persistent mental problems with critical levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are seen in survivors of COVID-19 at 1 year after discharge [3]. While studies of psychological distress currently focused on social anxiety and lockdown measures, a mental disorder due to COVID-19 may be a great deal in the future [4]. Thus, the question of the effective psychopharmacological treatment of this problem needs to be raised [5]. Objective. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 10-week escitalopram monotherapy in relieving the symptoms of depression in survivors of COVID-19. Methods. The study was conducted based on Railway Clinical Hospital #1 and on the Department of Medical Psychology, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy of National Medical University. After signing the informed consent, a total of 33 patients after COVID-19 and complaints of depressive symptoms that arose in the recovery period were assessed. The mean age was 37,54 Â± 8,97 years, 25 participants (75,65%) were females and 8 participants (24,24%) were males. depression of patients was assessed by 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale. The intervention consisted of the addition of a 10 mg per day (20 in cases of severe depression) dose of escitalopram to standard therapy of post-COVID syndrome for 10 weeks. A paired t-test was used to evaluate the difference in depressive symptoms pre- and post-treatment. Data collection and data analysis were carried out with Microsoft Excel and R â€“ programming language for data analysis and research. Results. The mean score on Hamilton Depression Scale before escitalopram prescription was 15.57 Â± 4.16 points. Before treatment 10 participants (30,3%) had symptoms of mild depression, 14 participants (42,42%) â€“ symptoms of moderate and 9 participants (27,27%) had symptoms of severe depression. No correlation between age, gender, and depressive symptoms were found. After 10-week treatment, the mean score on Hamilton Depression Scale was 5.72 Â± 2.87 points. 21 participants had no symptoms of depression (63,64%), 10 participants (30,30%) had symptoms of mild depression and 1 participant (3,03%) had symptoms of moderate depression. Therefore, a decrease in the score from baseline was 9.84 Â± 4.63 points (p&lt;0,001). The effect did not depend on age or gender. Conclusions: Our study confirms the common presence of depressive symptoms in patients in the recovery period after COVID-19. Treatment with escitalopram may be quite effective in reducing the symptoms of depression in patients with the post-COVID syndrome. However, it is also interesting to study the persistence of this effect, which was not evaluated in this study.

"P0504 Cognitive impairment in in-patients with COVID-19 pneumonia","Objective. COVID-19 is increasingly recognized as a systemic disease, and we are seeing more and more disorders of the nervous system, one of which is cognitive impairment, which has a significant negative impact on mental health, social maladaptation, quality of life [1]. Mental health disorders are closely related to COVID-19 at the biological, psychological, and social levels, and they are receiving more and more attention now [2]. Mental disorders may be the manifestations or complications of acute COVID-19, such as acute psychotic disorders, cognitive impairment, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, depression, and suicide attempts [2]. The study of cognitive impairment in patients with COVID-19 is the basis of neuropsychological rehabilitation for those who need it. It is important to urgently minimize the potential negative impact on cognitive and psychosocial functions and quality of life of patients with COVID-19 [3]. Methods. Cognitive function was examined using the MOCA test in 60 patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia as part of psychiatric screening on admission to the hospital. The study group of patients was represented by 34 (57%) men and 26 (43%) women. The age of patients ranged from 35 to 81 years (mean age was 62.4 years). 55 patients (92%) from the study group denied the presence of any organic or other mental disorders. 2 patients (3%) reported a previously diagnosed depressive disorder, 1 patient (2%) reported a bipolar disorder, and 2 patients (3%) reported an anxiety disorder. Results. 95% of inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had cognitive impairment of varying severity. Severe cognitive impairment was in 30% cases, in 47% - moderate -, in 18% - isolated, mild cognitive impairment, in 5% - no impairment. Data analysis shows both the presence of general cognitive dysfunction in patients with viral pneumonia COVID -19, and a more noticeable violation of its separate components: visual-spatial, executive functions,  thinking, attention, slow reproduction (long-term memory) (p &lt;0.01).The most noticeable were violations during the performance of tasks on visual-spatial, executive functions (2.25),  thinking (1.1), slow reproduction (long memory) (1, 7), attention (4.8,) (p &lt;0.01). It should be noted that almost all patients had no violation of recognition (3), orientation (5.8), and sequential subtraction (2.4) (p &lt;0.01). Conclusions. A study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia revealed cognitive impairment of varying severity. In addition, the largest violations of individual components were identified, such as visual-spatial, executive functions,  thinking, attention, slow reproduction (long-term memory). Recognition, orientation, and sequential subtraction are almost intact. The dynamics of disorders of individual components of cognitive functions, such as recognition, orientation, sequential subtraction, differs significantly from dementia. In the acute period of COVID-19 disease, studies of cognitive function have been performed, which may indicate that cognitive impairment may have reversible consequences. Identified cognitive impairments were taken into account when drawing up individual plans for neuropsychological rehabilitation.

"Public universities and impacts of COVID-19 in Australia: risk disclosures and organisational change","PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine the COVID-19 pandemic risk disclosures in a sample of annual reports of Australian public universities. These universities rely heavily on fee-paying onshore overseas students. Analysing these risk disclosures is essential to understanding the COVID-19 crisis and the implications for organisational change.Design/methodology/approachDocument analysis and content analysis of the 2019 annual reports of all Victorian public universities were undertaken to identify the disclosure of COVID-19 risk impacts. Applying Laughlin's Habermasian insights of change, the study explores the pathways of change adopted by universities to overcome the risk impacts. However, financial risk disclosures about income from this source were virtually non-existent.FindingsAny risk associated with COVID-19 disclosed was minimal in a qualitative, neutral and constant format. The quality of disclosures was low. Media statements, however, pointed to significant income loss and suggested a strategy of substantial cost-cutting, including employee redundancies, which we identified as morphostatic changes of universities to overcome the risk impacts.Research limitations/implicationsThe study reveals the risk associated with sector's aggressive growth strategy, jeopardising their financial viability and quality of teaching and research.Practical implicationsThe findings provide insights to the Australian higher education sector. The low quality of external risk disclosures of these universities suggests an urgent need for transformation.Originality/valueAustralian public universities play a crucial role in society. This role will be diminished by a failure to disclose and manage significant risks adequately.","Carnegie, Garry D.; Guthrie, James, Martin-Sardesai, Ann","https://doi.org/10.1108/AAAJ-09-2020-4906","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal; 35(1):61-73, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25114,""
"P0447 The psychopathological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on subjects suffering from mental disorders: an observational retrospective study","Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a pulmonary disease (COVID-19) which spread worldwide in 2020, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic [1] and the Italian government firstly to declare a state of emergency, then to impose restrictive measures lasting about two months. COVID-19 pandemic generated fear, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms in the general population [2,3] as well as among subjects affected by mental disorders [4]. Little is known about which different psychopathological changes the pandemic caused among individuals affected by different psychiatric disorders. Aims: To investigate potential psychopathological changes over time during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic comparing different psychiatric disorders. Methods: Data about demographic/clinical variables and psychopathological status were retrospectively collected. Specific psychometric scales were administered at three time points: T0 as outbreak of pandemic, T1 as lockdown period, T2 as reopening. Primary outcomes: Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Secondary outcomes: Disability Scale (DISS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Montgomery and Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Descriptive analyses and linear regression models were performed. Summary of results: A total of 166 outpatients were included. Overall, psychometric scores showed a significant worsening at T1 with a mild improvement at T2 (p&lt;0.05). Only psychotic and OC symptoms did not significantly improve at T2. Primary outcomes: time had a significant effect on the change of BPRS (F=26.56;p&lt;0.001), CGI-severity (F=8.29;p&lt;0.001), CGI-improvement (F=41.88;p&lt;0.001) and HAM-A (F=33.63;p&lt;0.001) scores. BPRS and CGI-S scores were higher among subjects affected by personality disorders (PDs) than in the depressed (MDD) and anxiety/obsessive-compulsive (OC) groups (p&lt;0.05). PD patients also showed higher HAM-A scores than schizophrenia (SKZ) ones (p=0.02). Secondary outcomes: Time had a significant effect on the change of DISS-stress (F=40.80;p&lt;0.001), DISS-support (F=9.26;p&lt;0.001), HAM-D (F=9.50;p&lt;0.001) and MADRS (F=9.40;p&lt;0.001) scores. The time effect was not significant for DISS-disability (F=1.23;p=0.29), PANSS (F=1.37;p=0.26), YMRS (F=2.84;p=0.06) and Y-BOCS (F=0.55;p=0.59) scores. DISS-disability scores were higher in the PD group with respect to bipolar disorder (BD) (p=0.009), MDD (p&lt;0.001) and anxiety/OCD (p=0.03) groups;SKZ and BD patients had lower DISS-stress scores than PD ones (both p values = 0.02). Conclusions: Patients affected by PDs showed to be particularly affected by the negative effects of outbreaks on mental health and perhaps they require specific clinical attention in case of traumatic events such as pandemics. Moreover, although SKZ patients reported lower anxiety levels than PD ones, the worsening of psychotic and OC symptoms should be strictly monitored by clinicians, as these aspects did not improve with the end of lockdown measures.

"MULTIDISCIPLINARY SPECIALTY CLINIC DECREASES HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION IN CHILDREN WITH FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS","Introduction: The biopsychosocial model has been used to describe the complex pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), and the literature is clear that conventional medical treatment alone is often inadequate and should be supplemented with behavioral and/or dietary treatment. We hypothesized that the implementation of a multidisciplinary clinic for children with FGIDs would lead to decreased healthcare utilization. Our objective was to compare healthcare utilization before and after the initial visit in a pediatric multidisciplinary FGID clinic. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of children seen in the FGID clinic at our institution for their initial visit from March 2018-November 2019 (to avoid any impact of the COVID-19 pandemic). Our FGID clinic sees patients referred from other gastroenterologists. The initial visit is a 60-minute visit with a pediatric gastroenterologist, psychologist, and at times a dietitian. We recorded baseline characteristics and clinic visit information. To evaluate impact on healthcare utilization, we compared phone calls, electronic messages, additional outpatient GI visits, emergency department (ED) or urgent care (UC) visits, and hospitalizations for GI symptoms three months before and after a patient's initial FGID clinic visit. Results: We included 49 patients (76% female, median age 16 years, range 5-19). Primary FGID diagnoses were functional abdominal pain (45%), irritable bowel syndrome (22%), functional dyspepsia (20%), rumination syndrome (6%), functional constipation (4%), and abdominal migraine (2%). Other diagnoses included anxiety (73%), depression (33%), and inflammatory bowel disease (2%). Prior testing included blood tests (86%), imaging (82%), esophagogastroduodenoscopy (78%), colonoscopy (35%), and manometry testing (31%). At the initial visit, 71% were on a medication for their GI symptoms, 76% were on a supplement or probiotic, and 35% were on a psychiatric medication. During their initial visit, 96% met with a psychologist and 18% met with a dietitian. Recommendations at the initial visit included new medications (76%), follow up with a GI psychologist (45%), dietary treatment (22%), imaging studies (16%), manometry testing (10%), psychiatry referral (10%), blood tests (8%), esophagogastroduodenoscopy (4%), and colonoscopy (2%). As shown in Table 1, total phone calls, electronic messages, and ED/UC visits for GI symptoms decreased after the FGID clinic visit (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, and p=0.02 respectively). Conclusion: Healthcare utilization decreased significantly after children with FGIDs were seen in a multidisciplinary FGID clinic. Our findings imply that establishing a multidisciplinary FGID clinic improves the care of children with these disorders and may also reduce the time and financial costs of caring for these disorders.(Table Presented)","Calafiore, D.; Van Diest, A.

"Editorial Introduction to Technological Approaches for the Treatment of Mental Health in Youth","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 10â€“20% of adolescents (10â€“19 years old) worldwide suffer from mental health conditions, with 50% starting at the age of 14 (World Health Organization 2020). [...]many youth are actively seeking resources online for mental health support (Stephens et al. 2020;Rideout et al. 2018). [...]digital interventions can provide alternative methods to support youth patients while addressing and improving the limitations of face-to-face delivery formats. Qualitative and quantitative data suggest that participants with high phone usage (i.e., receiving many notifications) did not experience â€œdigital overloadâ€, but they ignored the notifications. [...]when designing mental health apps, notifications alone may not improve engagement, and other factors should be taken into account, such as motivation. Overall results suggest that motivational interviews and the number of human contacts increased engagement, however, there was no significant improvement in depression scores based on engagement.

"Healthcare workersâ€™ perception of gender and work roles during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods study","ObjectivesA high functioning healthcare workforce is a key priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine how work and mental health for healthcare workers changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a universal healthcare system, stratified by gender factors.DesignA mixed-methods study was employed. Phase 1 was an anonymous, internet-based survey (7 Mayâ€“15 July 2020). Phase 2 was semistructured interviews offered to all respondents upon survey completion to describe how experiences may have differed by gender identity, roles and relations.SettingNational universal healthcare system (Canada).Participants2058 Canadian healthcare worker survey respondents (87% women, 11% men, 1% transgender or Two-Spirit), including 783 health professionals, 673 allied health professionals, 557 health support staff. Of the 63 unique healthcare worker types reported, registered nurses (11.5%), physicians (9.9%) and pharmacists (4.5%) were most common. Forty-six healthcare workers were interviewed.Main outcome measuresReported pandemic-induced changes to occupational leadership roles and responsibilities, household and caregiving responsibilities, and anxiety levels by gender identity.ResultsMen (19.8%) were more likely to hold pandemic leadership roles compared with women (13.4%). Women (57.5%) were more likely to report increased domestic responsibilities than men (45%). Women and those with dependents under the age of 10 years reported the greatest levels of anxiety during the pandemic. Interviews with healthcare workers further revealed a perceived imbalance in leadership opportunities based on gender identity, a lack of workplace supports disproportionately affecting women and an increase in domestic responsibilities influenced by gender roles.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic response has important gendered effects on the healthcare workforce. Healthcare workers are central to effective pandemic control, highlighting an urgent need for a gender-transformative pandemic response strategy.","Bria Scriven, Mele, Holroyd-Leduc, Jayna M.; Harasym, Patricia, Dumanski, Sandra M.; Fiest, Kirsten, Graham, Ian D.; Nerenberg, Kara, Norris, Colleen, Jeanna Parsons, Leigh, Pilote, Louise, Pruden, Harlan, Raparelli, Valeria, Rabi, Doreen, Ruzycki, Shannon M.; Somayaji, Ranjani, Henry Thomas, Stelfox, Ahmed, Sofia B.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056434","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25118,""

"Persistence Of Gastrointestinal Symptoms After Hospitalization For Covid-19: Prevalence And Risk Factors","Introduction Post-Infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome May Occur After 10% Of Acute Gastrointestinal (Gi) Infections And Can Cause Significant Long-Term Morbidity. Covid-19 Frequently Presents With Acute Gi Symptoms, But It Is Unclear How Often These Persist After Recovery. The Purpose Of This Study Was To Estimate The Prevalence Of Persistent Gi Symptoms After Covid-19 And To Identify Risk Factors For This. Methods Adult Patients Who Were Hospitalized With Covid-19 At Columbia University Medical Center Between March 1 And June 30, 2020 And Had A Primary Care Appointment 30 To 180 Days After Discharge Were Reviewed For The Presence Or Absence Of Documented Gi Symptoms (Diarrhea, Abdominal Pain, Nausea/Vomiting, Or Constipation) At Initial Presentation With Covid-19 And At Primary Care Follow Up. Patients Were Excluded If They Had A Pre Existing History Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Other Chronic Gi Conditions, Or Acute Enteric Infections During Hospitalization With Covid-19 (E.G., Clostridioides Difficile Infection). The Prevalence Of Persistent Gi Symptoms After Covid-19 Hospitalization Was Estimated, And Risk Factors Were Assessed. Results 187 Patients Hospitalized With Covid-19 Met Study Inclusion Criteria. Of These, 37 Were Excluded For Pre-Existing Gi Symptoms And 3 For C. Difficile Infection, Leaving 147 Patients In The Cohort. The Most Common Gi Symptoms At Initial Presentation With Covid-19 Were Diarrhea (23%), Nausea/Vomiting (21%), And Abdominal Pain (6.1%). After A Median Follow-Up Time Of 106 Days (Iqr 78-141), 16% Of Patients Had Persistent Gi Symptoms (95% Confidence Interval 11 To 23%).

"P0403 Disticnt effects of SSRIs therapy in patients with the first episode of major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder after COVID-19 disease","Introduction: The World Health Organization postulated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) is a pandemic situation in the whole world [1]. Although the main damaging of SARS-Cov-2 in the human organism is linked to its severe acute respiratory illness, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 implicates in the various central nervous system impairments and deteriorations [1,2]. The major clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in the brain are associated with its deleterious neurological and mental health actions [3]. Currently, we do not know exactly how actually SARS-CoV-2 might negatively alter the brain functions in humans. Today, there are limited findings concerning the studying of neuropsychiatric action for SARS-Cov-2 in humans after COVID-19 disease. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of SSRIs (escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine) for 6 months therapy on the affective profile of man and women with the first Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) cases following COVID-19 disease without any previous psychiatric diagnosis. Methods. For the assessment of affective profile in man and women (30-55 years) with the first MDD or GAD cases after COVID-19 disease, we used the different tests: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and anxiety scale (ShARS Scale). The hormonal and Vitamin D3 levels in the serum blood were measured by immune-enzyme analysis before and after SSRIs therapy. Results. After 6 months of SSRIs therapy, MADRS Scale showed a significant improvement of the depressive manifestations in both men and women with the first MDD case after COVID-19 (p%26lt;0,05). However, these patients of both gender demonstrated significantly high anxiety level by ShARS Scale. We found that SSRIs were able to reduce anxiety level only on 25%25 in man or on 35%25 in women with the first MDD case after COVID-19 before treatment (p%26lt;0,05). Interestingly, MADRS Scale showed a similar improvement of the depressive manifestations in both men and women with the first GAD case after COVID-19 treated with SSRIs for 6 months (p%26lt;0,05). Also, women with the first GAD case after COVID-19 treated with SSRIs had the parameters of their affective profile that were similarly to those of control group. The reduction of depressive symptoms in women with the first GAD case after COVID-19 treated with SSRIs was associated with restoration of cortisol concentrations in the serum blood compared to the initial levels. Conclusion: Thus, our pilot clinical study clearly demonstrated that SSRIs treatment have a beneficial effect on the depressive symptoms in patients of both gender with the first MDD or GAD cases after COVID-19. However, SSRIs therapy alone failed to produce the decrease of anxiety in the patients of both gender with the first MDD or GAD cases after COVID-19. In light of the demonstrated data, the importance of truly adequate treatment to the long-term neuropsychiatric outcomes of COVID-19 in patients of both gender, further randomized clinical trials involving new pharmacological therapies are needed in the future.

"Online supervision: Addressing clinical services in rural communities during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating implications across the globe, especially in rural communities. The virus has impacted physical, emotional, economic, and mental health functioning across populations. Many clinicians have transitioned to telemental health (TM-H) services in an effort to slow the spread of the virus while simultaneously providing ongoing support to their clients. The provision of TM-H includes distinct advantages and challenges for clinicians to navigate. This article describes how online clinical supervision may be leveraged to support clinicians providing TM-H to those within rural communities, especially in the context of the ongoing pandemic. Past research exploring factors affecting, known outcomes, and efficacy of online supervision is summarized as are practical, legal, and ethical considerations associated with the practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for mental health services and impacted how they are delivered. It has highlighted the utility of both telemental health services and supervision across communities and may be especially impactful in rural communities where mental health services and clinical supervision options are historically limited. The provision of high-caliber telemental health services and online clinical supervision are notable efforts toward addressing ongoing health disparities across communities and moving toward more equitable practices.

"Benefits of ""decentered and influential"" practices during telehealth: Establishing, slipping, and re-establishing position in a therapeutic conversation","Telehealth therapy has become a common platform to provide therapeutic services during the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to remain a viable option for services. Most mental health professionals had little prior experience in using this modality and have been experimenting with various ways of ensuring respectful, collaborative and effective ways of offering their services. A Decentered and Influential position offers numerous benefits that support anchoring therapists in a mindset that is conducive to optimized therapeutic conversations especially with people from socio-cultural and generational backgrounds different from their own. The value of this therapeutic position is illustrated by clinical work with a teenager struggling with violence towards family members during the quarantine. A description of clinical work where the therapist slipped to a centered position, and the re-engagement of a Decentered and Influential position, is exemplified by a discussion and preventive suggestions.

"Building youth and family resilience for better mental health: developing and testing a hybrid model of intervention in low- and middle-income countries","Resilience is a dynamic, multi-level, multi-systemic process of positive adaptation at the individual, family and community levels. Promoting resilience can be a cost-effective form of preventive and early intervention, offering significant health advantages for young people throughout their lives. Developing resiliency interventions for youth and their families in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in the context of the ongoing pandemic, is especially important given a lack of services and trained specialists, and poor levels of public spend on mental health, alongside marked and clustered psychosocial disadvantages and adverse childhood experiences. We propose a â€˜hybridâ€™ model targeting 10- to 17 year-old children and their families, and options to engage through communities, schools and the family unit. These options will enhance individual and family resilience, and possibly buffer against adversity. The adaptations respect cultural and health beliefs, take account of structural drivers of inequalities and are suitable for LMICs.","Basu, Debasish, Nagpal, Sugandha, Pillai, Renjith R.; Mutiso, Victoria, Ndetei, David, Bhui, Kamaldeep","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2021.129","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The British Journal of Psychiatry; 220(1):4-6, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25125,""
"A unified deep neuro-fuzzy approach for COVID-19 twitter sentiment classification","Covid-19 braces serious mental health crisis across the world. Since a vast majority of the population exploit social media platforms such as twitter to exchange information, rapid collecting anf analyzing social media data to understand personal well-being and subsequently adopting adequate measures could avoid severe socio-economic damage. Sentiment analysis on twitter data is very useful to understand and identify the mental health issues. In this research, we proposed a unified deep neuro-fuzzy approach for Covid-19 twitter sentiment classification. Fuzzy logic has been a very powerful tool for twitter data analysis where approximate semantic and syntactic analysis is more relevant because correcting spelling and grammar in tweets are merely obnoxious. We conducted the experiment on three challenging COVID-19 twitter sentiment datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that fuzzy Sugeno integral based ensembled classifers succeed over individual base classifiers.

"P0197 Self-harm conduct in young population during the covid-19 pandemic: a comparative analysis pre and post lockdown","COVID-19 pandemic has meant an unprecedented increase on the Spanish health system. The measures adopted by the government to decrease the spread of the disease, have probably taken a toll on the mental health of the population [1], and especially on young people, resulting on an increase in self-harm conducts. The term self-harm is used to explain a range of behaviors, and there is much debate within the literature as to what constitutes self-harm. For the purpose of this paper, we defined it as cutting, burning, biting, or hitting done directly to the body with the intention to regulate or express emotional distress, without a suicidal purpose. Self-injurious behavior has been considered symptomatic of more complex disorders, however in the more recent years we've witnessed a rapid increase and the normalization of the conduct on younger generations [2]. Even though there is no universal criteria recognised for deliberate self-harm, the increasing tendency has led changes in the way mental health workers understand it. The last edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), for example, now includes self-harm on section 3 as a new diagnostic entity that needs further research [3]. On our daily clinical practice and to be precise, after the lockdown imposed by the government, we've too have seen an important surge on the numbers of young patients presenting with self-harm conducts. Considering the above, we propose 2 main objectives. On a general level, we want to verify if the increasing trend observed in the clinical practice is really founded and if it is in what percentage has it increased. On the other hand, in a more specific level we want to determine if there is a significant increase in the number of patients seen for the first time in our ambulatory practice presenting self-harm as part of their symptoms. We plan a retrospective comparative study, with a study period of 6 months prior to the lockdown (September 2019 to March 2020) and 6 months after the lockdown (September 2020 to March 2021) with a total of 629 new patients between the ages of 6 to 18 years, sent to our child and adolescent mental health ambulatory service. As preliminary conclusions we can highlight that it has been an increase of 50% in the number of first visits during the 6 months after the lockdown, in relation to the 6 months prior to lockdown. To our understanding this number strongly suggests the potential influence that COVID-19 pandemic has in the mental stability of young population.

"Treating children exposed to domestic violence: Group-based intervention","Domestic violence is a serious societal problem that sadly threatens many children. Results from the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV) demonstrate that nearly 26% of children are exposed to family violence during their lifetime, including psychological/emotional intimate partner violence, physical intimate partner violence, parental assault of a sibling, and/or other family violence (Hamby et al., 2011). The consequences can be significant. For instance, childhood exposure to intimate partner violence is associated with mental health issues, such as posttraumatic stress and anxiety symptoms (Hamby et al., 2011). While rates of domestic violence have been declining in the past few decades (Truman & Morgan, 2014), an increase in rates may be occurring from COVID-19. More specifically, Bradbury-Jones and Isham (2020) gave the following bleak warning regarding COVID-19: ""Domestic violence rates are rising, and they are rising fast"" (p. 2047). As Bradbury-Jones and Isham (2020) explain, one reason for this rise could be because ""home is often the space where physical, psychological, and sexual abuse occurs"" (p. 2047), making increased time at home during the pandemic problematic for sufferers of domestic violence. In all, it is clear that childhood exposure to domestic violence is serious and consequential, as well as a timely issue to consider given the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, results for interventions discussed in the two articles by Overbeek et al. (2017) and Pernebo et al. (2019) give hope that the consequences of childhood exposure to domestic violence can be mitigated through proper intervention.

"P0019 Alcohol use increase in polysubstance users during quarantine related to SARS-Cov2 infection-19","Introduction A quarantine related to the spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was mandatory in France from March 17 to May 10, 2020. This quarantine could have psychological consequences on general population and vulnerable people such as substances users [1]. Anticipated consequences of behavioral changes related to substance use in context of quarantine have emerged in literature [2]. Changes in substances use could led to an increase of health issues such as mortality due to overdose notably [3]. Some authors suggested that quarantine related to covid-19 pandemic could increase alcohol use [4,5]. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of polysubstance users who have increased their alcohol use and determine risk factors for these changes. Methods: An anonymous Internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 8 and May 10, 2020. Participants were recruited via posts and Internet messages on a French online Forum related to drug use (www.psychoactif.org). This website is a forum dedicated to harm reduction and information on psychoactive drugs and lead by volunteers. We included participants that reported at least the use of two substances including alcohol. Only French citizen living on French territories were included Since 30 % of visitors on psychoactif web site are living in others francophone countries, we excluded them, due to different quarantine conditions between countries. Study variables were collected by using a questionnaire designed for the present study. Declarative data from this survey questions included socio demographical informations and questions on quarantine conditions notably number of days of quarantine and quarantine domestic conditions. Participants were asked on questions pertaining to use of alcohol (â€œSince the beginning of the quarantine, have you increased, diminished, quitted or maintained your alcohol consumption). Current alcohol use was examined using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test Consumption (AUDIT). Alcohol craving during quarantine was assessed using Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS), and Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Hospital Depression and Anxiety scale (HAD). Substances use and medication use were reported. The rates of users were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the associations of demographic or clinical variables with alcohol increase were assessed using odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI from a multivariate logistic regression. Results: 1310 polysubstance users completed the survey. A total of 974 (74.3%, [95%CI, 72.2-76.4]) participants reported alcohol use of whom 405 participants (41.6 %, [IC95 38.5-44.7]) reported an increase in alcohol use since the start of quarantine. Odds of alcohol use increase was higher for participants with married/domestic partnership (OR, 1.8 [95%CI, 1.4- 2.5]), and those with HAD scores higher than 7 (OR, 1.7 [95%CI, 1.2-2.3]), AUDIT scores lower than 8 (OR, 2.0 [95%CI, 1.4-2.8]), and OCDS scores greater than 7(IQR) (OR, 3.2 [95%CI, 2.3 - 4.5]). Odds of alcohol use increase was higher for psychostimulant users (OR, 1.7 [95%CI, 1.3 -2.5]). Conclusion: Prevention on the emergence of alcohol use disorders in light and moderate drinkers during quarantine should be considered by health policies and target specifically polysubstance users who reported psychostimulant use, higher levels of alcohol craving, anxiety and depression.

"Marketing research in Brazil and the challenge/opportunity for contribution and legitimation in the pandemic: Revista Brasileira de Marketing","In this year of 2020, 40 papers were published in four issues of the Brazilian Journal of Marketing (BJMkt) / Revista Brasileira de Marketing (ReMark). Its authors come from 15 Brazilian states, covering all its regions, and some foreign countries. It means an extensive recognition of the Journal by the academic Marketing community. We are very grateful for the essential collaboration of the reviewers, who lend competence to the evolution of third-party manuscripts, in one of the most important stages of the editorial process in a periodic. They provide evolution and learning for the authors even when the manuscript is not accepted for publication. We were pledged by the permanent dedication to the Journal of the librarian Cristiane dos Santos Monteiro. Support has also always come from Editora UNINOVE, the director of the Graduate Program in Administration at UNINOVE, Priscila Rezende da Costa, and from professor JosÃ© Eduardo Storopoli. A phenomenon dominated the year on the Planet Earth: the disease (Covid-19) caused by the new coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2), with alarming levels of contamination. In March, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic state;nine months have passed (OPAS, 2020). A global public health crisis took place. It would be the real milestone to distinguish the beginning of the XXI Century (Jansen, 2020). Virtually no one in the current world population has lived a similar precedent, since the Spanish Flu pandemic had ended (curiously) a century ago (Martino, 2017;Barry, 2020). So long afterwards, humanity's vulnerability to a viral pathology is surprising. Metaphorical descriptions range from the audience of a heady science-fiction film to a huge fireplace in which we are all burning (Muhammet, Alfiya, Masalimova, Cherdymova & Shaidullina, 2020). The pandemic has generated and continues to generate profound impacts in several human, social, business and governmental dimensions. It is not even known when its adverse effects on society will disappear, despite the well-founded expectations regarding vaccines, with numerous development projects, both in the West and in the East. Health Sciences, in its various branches, continues to research the prevention and treatment of the new and complicated pathology (Carvalho, Lima & Coeli, 2020;Heymann & Shindo, 2020). On this front, even though health management in Brazil appears abroad as one of the most complicated case in the application of Science (Gostin, 2020), it is the base that can be counted on. With it, the countries of the United Kingdom, this December, became the first in the West in vaccination against the illness;and seek to achieve record speed in the immunization process (Strasburg and Fidler, 2020);it is the struggle of all nations. This scientific effort has repercussions, as never before, in people's daily lives. It is not from today the recognition of the role of Science in crisis situations, when fundamental needs of the human species are put in check (Oliveira, 1998). But, in the present, the press constantly brings news to laypeople about scientific results and perspectives. Despite some noise controversies, the majority of the population acknowledges and values the crucial role of Science, which advances, with determination and sacrifice, in understanding the ecosystem that has the new disease at its center (Lipsitch, Swerdlow & Finelli, 2020;Velloso, 2020). Only Science can find solutions to remedy the crisis or, at least, alleviate its implications and this unique role is recognized by the population. It is the way to develop ways to face fear, deprivation, anxiety, impatience, pain, and, at the limit, death and hopelessness. The commitment goes far beyond the Health Sciences, spreading to practically all fields. Demography (Dowd, Andriano, Brazel, Rotondi, Block et al., 2020), Criminology (Ashby, 2020), Engineering (Goel, Hawi, Goel, Thakur, Agrawal et. Al., 2020) and Librarianship (Ali & Gatiti, 2020) are some examples of this scope. Even in the Administration sphere, there are initiatives in several disciplines (Zhang Hu & Ji, 2020), in the business and also public domains (Lunn, Belton, Lavin, McGowan, Timmons & Robertson, 2020). On the other hand, the tremendous and understandable interest, in most people, in news about the pandemic, its consequences and solutions, can open space to the temptation of distorted practices, if not of frauds covered with science or pseudoscience (Scheirer, 2020;Berruyer, 2020). It is essential to speed up the preliminary availability of research results, but this practice also poses risks to the quality of scientific production and to the dissemination to practitioners. Just think of the controversy surrounding the potential curative or not of the drug Hydroxychloroquine (Gautret, Lagier, Parola, Hoang, Meddeb et al., 2020). We move on to Marketing! An unusual and significant phenomenon such as the pandemic must have multiple repercussions on the models and theories of Marketing, leaving to decipher them. This year, two articles in ReMark addressed the phenomenon: â€œCOVID-19 pandemic: trails for future marketing research involving the regulatory role of prosocial consumptionâ€, in issue 3;â€œThe intention of prevention and future spending during COVID-19: a study considering decision-making at riskâ€, in this number 4. These are initial steps and so many others will come right here. In parallel, there is a succession of commercial research and practitioners' reflections on the immediate and more lasting consequences of the pandemic. Several Brazilian and global market research and consulting firms have completed surveys with consumers and companies. They cover consumer behavior as much as marketing management. The press, in general and specialized newspapers and magazines, disseminates these findings. The own media of research and consultancy companies do so on websites, blogs and social networks. Along these lines, PwC (2020) compared city dwellers in many countries (including Brazil) before and after the pandemic. It provided insights into the reinvention - in progress and possibly in the future - of people's shopping, consumption, learning, communication, entertainment and work journeys, amid the accelerated use of digital channels. It outlined implications for managing market relationship, which requires reinvention. GfK (2020) mapped consumption and post-crisis habits in Brazil, with subsidies for the management in the reality of the 'new normal', a modified standard of normality. It took into account characteristics of the population (high proportion of people with low income and education) and other dimensions of the country's macro environment (previous years of economic crisis, unemployment rate, health). GfK still publishes, twice a month, an updated picture of the 'consumer pulse' in face of the new coronavirus. KANTAR (2020) has published more than 10 editions of its research on the influences of the pandemic on consumers in Brazil. In one of the latter, it reports the intention of many people to maintain behavioral changes in the 'new reality' to come (although it is not known when it will come). IPSOS (2020) investigated changes in the consumer's life in the country in terms of shopping hours, migration between channels, determinants, reasons and barriers to purchase, under the effects of uncertainty, tensions and fears. It added a new meaning to the role of buyer. It discussed the changes already manifested and the prospect of continuity beyond the pandemic. NIELSEN (2020) unveiled six key stages in the consumer adaptation process, associated with concerns about the pandemic, as well as the heterogeneity in Brazilian regions, states and cities, interspersed with much learning about consumption. It alerted companies to opportunities to raise awareness of consumers about the crisis and, thus, strengthen ties with them and expand business ahead. This is just an excerpt from a large collection, very useful and praiseworthy. But that is more â€œmarketâ€ or â€œproblem solvingâ€ research (Hunt, 2015: 64-66), with its undeniable value. Such collection, however, is not a substitute for sci ntific research, capable of providing genuine new, validated and generalizable contribution to the discipline of Marketing, in general, and in the field of Consumer Behavior, in particular. Maintaining a critical spirit, Bunge's lesson (1998: 3-6) is taken: science is not just an extension or even a mere refinement of common knowledge. Science constitutes knowledge of a special kind, since it deals primarily (though not only) with unobservable events, not suspected by the layperson, articulates conjectures beyond ordinary knowledge and tests such them with the help of special techniques. Therefore, there would be no way to take commercial research as Science. Continuing with the solid foundations of Bunge (1998), we turn to the contexts of discovery and justification. The discovery also emerges from non-scientific means (such as creativity and inspiration), which attracts more the attention of the press. Yet justification - reasoning about evidence, replicability, substantiating hypotheses, empirical testing of propositions and theories, validity, etc. - is linked to the scientific method and its agents (scientists). Marketing research - academic, guided by the scientific method - is also already engaged in the investigation of the ongoing and intricate reality of the pandemic. Its pace is not what you would like and need. We did not have significant budgets for Marketing research in Brazil;such a resource has now become even more scarce. However, the mobilization of other resources - especially the training and intrinsic motivation of the researchers - will bear fruit in this situation, when their contributions are potentially useful as never before. ReMark / BJMkt has its doors open to welcome advances in this direction. Increasing itsspeed is a challenge to be faced. Challenge that constitutes an exceptional opportunity to legitimize Marketing as Science. The Brazilian Journal of Marketing adhere and is open to initiatives towards such target. We sincerely wish you, the reader, strength, health and overcoming, in addition to productivity, in 2021!

"COVID 19 and subjective mental well-being: Changes throughout the crisis","As societies have restrictive health policies and social distancing procedures to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, these measures have severely affected subjective mental health. In this study, using 3 waves from the U.K. Household Longitudinal Survey, we focus on changes in well-being in the United Kingdom by examining 2 points during the pandemic-short-term effects (April 2020;N = 7251) and long-term effects (July 2020;N = 7199). The short-term analysis reveals that 3 groups of people experienced greater levels of deterioration in mental well-being: (a) age group (20-39), (b) females, and (c) those who are facing financial pressures. The long-term analysis, on the other hand, shows some quite different patterns: (a) the age group effect almost disappears, (b) the gender effect disappears, (c) the effect of financial pressures become much stronger particularly for those who are doing the worst, and (d) participating in social networks (living with a partner, having close friends, and having older children) mitigate the detrimental effects of the pandemic. We further show that men benefit from living with a partner significantly more than women in the long-term model. Overall, our findings call for a more nuanced analysis of the pandemic's well-being effects, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between the short-term and long-term mechanisms.

"The psychology of migration: Facing cultural and religious diversity","This book forms an introduction into new or emerging discipline of ""psychology of migration,"" which is an interdisciplinary field of research, joining together diverse subfields of psychology (cultural psychology, social psychology, environmental psychology, health & clinical psychology, psychology of religion and spirituality) with anthropological, sociological and historical inquiry on migration processes (usually named ""migration studies""). In the introductory part the borders of this borderline discipline are marked, important notions and the subject of inquiry defined, its main research themes presented altogether with prospective ways of discipline's development, having in mind that there are many ""white spots"" yet to be covered in the field. The second part presents research methods applied in psychology of migration, dividing them, classically, into quantitative and qualitative, and providing examples of research projects in which exemplary methods and tools were used. Acculturation processes and their psychological analysis, forming one of the core themes in psychology of migration, are the main topic of interest in the third part. Next chosen research outcomes in the respect of mental health of migrants from an War Displacement Model as well as eco-cultural and epigenetic perspective are presented. The last part of the book covers issues of mutual relations between religion and migration, in the context of cultural and religious diversity. Some possible ways of the discipline's development are delineated (e.g. psychology of spirituality and migration), and further theoretical models such as Five Metaphors of Religion and Migration or CBS (Culture-Bound Spiritualities) are presented. Finally some conclusive remarks on contemporary psychology of migration facing cultural and religious diversity in COVID-19 pandemic times are outlined, pointing at challenges the discipline will surely meet in the future.

"P0803 Association of polygenic risk scores and hair cortisol with mental health trajectories during COVID-lockdown","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting measures (such as lockdowns) can be regarded as a global stressor. Mental health responses to major life events or potential traumas vary from individual to individual. The most consistently observed mental health trajectories in response to potentially traumatic events are resilience, recovery, chronic and delayed onset. The influencing factors for these different stress reactions remain unclarified. Various studies have investigated predictors for mental health outcomes due to the lockdown, emphasizing factors such as demographic and lifestyle variables. In contrast, studies on the impact of biological parameters, such as the genetic risk for the occurrence of mental health disorders, or cortisol levels for the impact of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, are still scarce. Polygenic Risk Scores indicate individual propensities to specific phenotypes and have been related to negative mental health outcomes. Long-term elevated cortisol levels, frequently measured by hair cortisol concentration (HCC), have been shown to be related to stress-related mental disorders, but the findings are highly inconsistent. Therefore, there is an undeniable need to analyze the impact of these biological parameters on mental health during COVID-lockdown. Objective: In line with earlier findings, we could identify three mental health trajectories (â€œrecoveredâ€, 9.0%;â€œresilientâ€, 82.6%;â€œdelayed dysfunctionâ€, 8.4%) during the first lockdown in Germany. The aim of this study is to analyze the associations of specific possible biological risk factors with trajectories that classify vulnerable participants. Method: Within the scope of the longitudinal resilience study (LORA), which is ongoing since 2017, participants have been deeply phenotyped, including mental health, genetic, and cortisol assessment. A subsample of 523 participants completed weekly online questionnaires on, e.g., mental health (GHQ-28), COVID-19-related, and general stressor exposure during COVID-Lockdown. Blood was collected at the baseline of the original LORA study and was used to perform Polygenic Risk Score calculation for participants from the LORA-COVID subsample. Hair samples were collected quarterly for the determination of long-term Glucocorticoid hair cortisol concentration. Multivariate Logistic Regression will be presented on the associations of cortisol exposure and polygenic risk scores with the observed trajectories. Results: Preliminary results indicate a significant association between elevated Glucocorticoid hair cortisol concentration and the membership to an ""at-risk"" trajectory. Participants can be well assigned to different mental health trajectories by combining the information of different Polygenic Risk Scores and long-term cortisol concentration. Conclusion: Long-term Glucocorticoid hair cortisol concentration seems to be a significant predictor for the mental health response to a global stressor, hence the COVID-lockdown. Furthermore, Polygenic Risk Scores give additional information for reliable classification of participants to different mental health responses. There is an undeniable need for further analyses to discover genetic and environmental risk factors for certain trajectories after stressor exposure to develop specific interventions adapted to every individual's needs.

"Highlights of this issue","Combining data from 12 UK population studies, they found that people with poor pre-pandemic mental health experienced greater overall disruption to their lives across multiple domains, but specifically greater likelihood of economic and healthcare disruptions. Prior research demonstrating that clinician questions about suicidal behaviour don't increase the risk of such behaviour has been reassuring and influential for conducting safe and good-quality risk assessments. Using data from The Netherlands and Belgium, where psychiatric euthanasia and/or medically assisted suicide (EAS) is permitted, they critically examine the difference between EAS and suicide â€“ arguing that the characterisation of suicide as impulsive or violent is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient distinction from the apparently calm â€˜death wishâ€™ of EAS.","Adlington, Katherine","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2021.178","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The British Journal of Psychiatry; 220(1):A3, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25139,""
"Limited negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health measures of Ghanaian university students","Background Stress and mental health outcomes are negatively correlated among university students throughout the world. Reports of differences in stress perception by gender exist, but there is limited data on students from sub-Saharan African countries. This study describes the burden of perceived and financial stress;characterizes mood and degree of anxiety symptoms;examines stress coping mechanisms, including resilience and repetitive negative thinking (RNT);and explores how students at a Ghanaian university believed the COVID-19 pandemic affected these measures. Methods Students (n=129) were recruited from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana from October 2020 - January 2021. Validated surveys were used. Participants were asked â€œAre your answers to the questions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?â€ Results No differences in mean scores were observed between genders. For female students, financial stress was positively associated with RNT (pÂ =Â 0.009), negative mood (pÂ =Â 0.002), and anxiety (p &lt; 0.001). Males were more likely to report decreased stress during the pandemic (pÂ =Â 0.002), but there was no difference in mental health outcomes by perceived stress (PS) change category among males. Effects of the pandemic on mental health outcomes were mixed, but substantial proportions of students reported improvements or no change in financial stress, mood, anxiety, and RNT. Limitations Students from one university particiapted in this cross-sectional survey. Conclusions This study adds to the understanding of how higher education students are experiencing stress and are coping with the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana.","Adjepong, Mary, Amoah-Agyei, Felicity, Du, Chen, Wang, Wenyan, Fenton, Jenifer I.; Tucker, Robin M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100306","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100306, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25140,""
"Courting innovative diplomacy for health safety and security amidst the Covid-19 pandemic;the case of South Africa","Notwithstanding its level of socio-economic development, health failure is a threat to any country. Globally, the Covid-19 pandemic is believed to be the greatest threat to the existentiality of humanity since the end of World War II. The level of global interconnectivity also made it the most destructive to human existence. The accelerating growth of the pandemic in South Africa has devastated effects on its economy and cuttingly intensified prior socio-economic challenges and inadvertently, presented South Africa with an unseen and formidable enemy that does not know the differences between South African Black, Coloured, Indian or White. The study used a qualitative research approach, underpinned by the rationality for South Africa, to embrace innovative diplomacy as a means to an end for its health safety and security amidst the covid-19 pandemic. The paper argued that South Africa must innovatively engage the acceptable global mechanisms and other health security measures with focus on its commitment to the goals of its national interests, while strengthening the efficiency of its health initiatives through better-quality governance where both local and international investors are allowed to participate actively in state socio-economic activities that respond to the safety and health security of the emotionalized publics. Thus, in a globalised system of innovation, South Africa needs to see the innovation environment as a steady pipeline of its domestic ability to control the negative effect of Covid-19 on its national health security. The paper concludes that South Africa must begin to invest, modify, and localise the biotechnology industry, and thus serving as a source of employment for the teaming unemployed South Africans.","Adetiba, Toyin Cotties","https://doi.org/10.21303/2504-5571.2021.002068","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: EUREKA: Social and Humanities; - (6):31-42, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25141,""

"The influence of corona related factors on acute psychiatric admissions","Background: Since the COVID-19 outbreak there are warnings for an increase of psychological complaints in the general population and in psychiatric patients. Aim: To gain insight in corona associated factors that can provoke psychiatric decompensation, wherefore admission in our psychiatric clinic was necessary. To investigate if the admission rate of our clinic increased since the start of the quarantine measures. Method: From the 16th of March until the 1st of June 2020 we collected data in our psychiatric acute admission clinic in Amsterdam of patients with a corona associated triggering factor for the current psychiatric decompensation. Additionally, the admission rates between the 16th of March and the 1st of June 2020 were compared with the admission rates in the same period in 2019. Results: In 25 of 120 admitted patients there was a corona associated triggering factor. The disruption of daily routine and increased stress due to corona were mentioned most often. In the studied period there were significantly more admissions in 2020 compared to 2019. Conclusion: The corona crisis can contribute to psychiatric decompensation. In a fifth of the admitted patients a corona associated triggering factor was mentioned. Furthermore we observed a higher demand for psychiatric admissions since the start of the quarantine measures in comparison with 2019.

"Mental Health of Diabetic Patients during Coronavirus 2019 Epidemic","Coronavirus 2019 is a type of viral pneumonia that broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is now spreading rapidly worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said in a statement that the virus has caused a public health emergency around the world. On the other hand, people with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease or autoimmunity are more exposed to severe consequences of coronavirus infection. However the health recommendations for preventing coronavirus are the same in all people, in these circumstances, less attention is paid to the mental health of these people. Mental health is an important factor in fighting disease that can even lead to improved physical health in individuals. Coronavirus anxiety has put the mental health of people with underlying diseases, such as diabetes, at risk, and consequently their physical health. In this situation, people with diabetes can help their physical function by using psychological treatments and prevent severe coronavirus symptoms as much as possible.

"Occupation under siege: Resolving mental health crises in police work","The book is based on research associated with police mental health together with the subsequent effects on officer's performance, physical health, and lifestyle. It outlines the current challenges face by police, increased civil unrest, negative public reactions, and a biological siege brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. These events have caused personnel shortages, long work hours, and psychological and physical assaults upon the police. The book turns to the present mental health status of police officers. Posttraumatic Stress (PTSD) and depression appear to be prevalent in police. Police officers are repeatedly exposed to traumatic situations including motor vehicle accidents, armed conflicts, and witnessing violent death across their working lives. Depression and PTSD are often found together in officers. Several studies on police have found the prevalence of depression to be approximately 12% which is nearly twice as high as the general population. Both depression and PTSD promote poor health through a complex interaction between biological and psychological mechanisms. In today's societal and politically conflicted environment, the police are caught between the requirements of the job and the ability to fulfill these requirements. The book discusses the effects of police stress and trauma on physical health. The stress and trauma that police face can eventually wear down the body's defense against disease. The book discusses resilience and its role in ameliorating stress. Resilience is simply defined as bouncing back from adversity. There are, however, many dimensions of resiliency to consider. The book asks the question, ""Where do we go from here?"" It also discusses current legislation which will help police deal with the problem of psychological, physical health, and suicide. The book will help researchers and those dedicated officers who go out every day and ""drive and walk the beat"". It is those officers who bear the brunt of policing.

"Mitigating the Impacts of Childhood Exposure to Domestic Violence on Latino Children in California","[...]a clinical study done by Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) found a strong graded relationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes of death in adults.6 Domestic violence is considered an ACE, a traumatic event occurring before the age of 18.7 While the Kaiser Permanente study did not examine the intersection of ACEs and Latino identity, more recent studies show that Latinos report significantly higher rates of exposure to ACEs.8 Impacts of Childhood Exposure to Domestic Violence Children who are exposed to domestic violence suffer worse physiological, psychological, and emotional outcomes.9 Physiologically, some may experience stomach aches or headaches in the short term;in the long term, they may be at higher risk for diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.10 Other physiological symptoms include trouble falling asleep, bed wetting, showing signs of terror, and engaging in risky behaviors such as imbibing in drugs or alcohol.11 Psychologically, children who are exposed to domestic violence may develop fear, anxiety, and depression.12 Children may also develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).13 In fact, children who were exposed to violence for more than 75 percent of their lives exhibit significantly more PTSD problems than children who are not exposed.14 Emotionally, children may express a number of behaviors or responses due to exposure including intense terror, fear of death, fear of loss of a parent, rage, feelings of guilt, and a sense of responsibility for the violence.15 This is supported by evidence in maternal reports that state 47 percent of children responded to violent incidents with intense levels of emotional distress.16 Additionally, children exposed to domestic violence are a high-risk population for either becoming abusers or entering abusive relationships themselves.17 Children may experience one or all of these symptoms and outcomes due to exposure to domestic violence. Economic Disparities In comparison to other racial groups, Latinos are disproportionately impoverished, comprising 51.4 percent of poor Californians but only 39.6 percent of the state population.22 The widespread level of poverty across the Latino community is significant because poverty restricts the resources used to develop healthy habits and behaviors.23 Poverty is also associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes.24 These outcomes include shorter life expectancy, higher rates of infant mortality, higher death rates for the 14 leading causes of death, and these can alter children's cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical development.25,26 That means Latino children who are impoverished are also more likely to be food insecure, more likely to develop toxic stress, and are at the greatest risk for poor life outcomes.27 Health Disparities One of the ways to mitigate impacts of exposure to domestic violence is through preventative medicine or through medical interventions (e.g., therapy, medicine). Structural barriers are obstacles that collectively and disproportionately affect a group by perpetuating or maintaining disparities in outcomes.28 Structural barriers to accessing health care, in this case, are policies and practices that systematically disadvantage the Latino community.29 A key structural barrier to accessing health care is health insurance, and in the United States, Latinos have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or ethnic group.30 The high uninsured rates are affected by a lack of employer coverage (e.g., Latinos are overrepresented in the essential and gig labor economies) and citizenship restrictions.31 Without insurance, Latino families often weigh medical needs equally to other basic needs, like transportation and food, due to the high cost of medical care without insurance.32 In fact, uninsured patients are charged two to four times more than what health insurers or public programs pay for hospital services, and in many cases they are asked to pay up front before they receive care.33 Although federal health insurance policies have widened access for low-income Latino families, Latinos who are undocumented do not have access to federal health insurance coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, or the Affordable Care Act).34 Even if Latino children are able to access healthcare, they must still contend with language and cultural barriers that exist within the medical system.35 Despite laws dictating that hospitals and other medical facilities provide meaningful access to their patients, many continue to fall short and rely on family members or friends to interpret for them.36 That means when Spanish-speaking members of the Latino community attempt to access medical treatment, they are likely not receiving accurate and quality care due to barriers in communication.37 Further, Latino children face physiological health disparities and are at greater risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes.38 This may be due to a lack of access to preventative care (e.g., check-ups, screenings for preventable diseases).39 Though medical care can be used to address the impacts of domestic violence, it is clear that it is not necessarily a reliable or accessible option for many Latino youth. In many instances, Latinos must overcome a language barrier in order to use these resources.40 Other factors that dissuade and inhibit the Latino community from accessing resources are a lack of familiarity with the legal system, a fear of deportation, and a limited knowledge about the resources that are available.41 Domestic violence prevention policies also tend to be punitive and result in out-of-family support rather than in-family support.42 Latino children may also be instructed not to seek help by their families due to familism.43 Familism is a multifaceted traditional Latino cultural value that dictates norms, expectations, and beliefs about the family.44 Key features of familism that can impact Latino youths ability to seek help are: 1. the subjugation of ones individual needs to those of the family;2. greater expectations surrounding family responsibility compared with non-Latino white individuals;and 3. obedience and respect for those in positions of authority within the family.45 Familism in Latino households is meant to serve as a protective mechanism for","Sangit, Marina","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mitigating+the+Impacts+of+Childhood+Exposure+to+Domestic+Violence+on+Latino+Children+in+California","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy; 33:57-68, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25153,""
"Quality of diet of vegetarians and non-vegetarians during COVID-19 pandemic and its association with Body Mass Index, questionnaire-based assessment","INTRODUCTION Elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk of not only cardiovascular (CVD) morbidity and mortality, but also lower risk of depression, type 2 diabetes, inflammation, carciongenesis. Vegetarian diet contributes to lower CVD risk and lower BMI. The aim of the study was assessment of the diet quality during the COVID-19 pandemic among vegetarian and non-vegetarian subpopulations. MATERIAL AND METHODS An online survey was distributed via social media channels. The questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic questions and the assessment of dietary habits based on the Polish komPAN questionnaire. Data were collected from 1987 people, 1956 met all study conditions. 40.23% respondents (n = 787) were vegetarians, 84% (n = 1649) were females. BMI and Prohealthy-Diet-Index-10 (pHDI-10) were established based on the collected data. Chi-square tests were performed between sexes, vegetarians and non-vegetarians. RESULTS The prevalence of excessive body weight (BMI &gt;24.99 kg/m2) was higher among non-vegetarians than vegetarians (28.91% vs 17.03% respectively, P &lt;0.05). Males were overweight or obese more often than females (44.95% vs 20.25% respectively, P &lt;0.05). Among vegetarian males, recommended body weight (BMI &gt;15.99 and &lt;24.99) occurred more often than among non-vegetarian males (66.27% vs 49.11% respectively, P &lt;0.05). Among non-vegetarian respondents who declared meat consumption less often than once a day the prevalence of excessive body weight was lower than among those who consumed meat at least once a day (22% vs 34% respectively, P &lt;0.05). According to the pHDI-10 24.52% vegetarians had a 'moderately healthy' diet (pHDI &gt;6.67 and pHDI &lt;13.33) and none of the vegetarians had a 'very healthy diet' (pHDI &gt;13.33), 36.61% non-vegetarians had a 'moderately healthy' diet and 0.34% non-vegetarians had a 'very healthy' diet. CONCLUSIONS Vegetarians have recommended body weight more often than non-vegetarians. Less frequent meat consumption was associated with higher prevalence of recommended body weight. According to pHDI-10, intensity of prohealthy dietary habits was higher among non-vegetarians.","Piekarska, M.; PszczÃ³lka, M.; Kasiak, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Quality+of+diet+of+vegetarians+and+non-vegetarians+during+COVID-19+pandemic+and+its+association+with+Body+Mass+Index,+questionnaire-based+assessment","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Kardiologia Polska; 79(SUPPL 1):131-132, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25154,""

"Social media mining to understand the impact of cooperative education on mental health","Cooperative education is a form of work-integrated learning that includes both classroom study terms and paid work experience. Prior work has studied the benefits of cooperative education for students, employers, and academic institutions. In contrast, this article studies the impact of co-operative education on students' mental well-being. This is done by mining the Reddit social media platform, which includes, among many other topics, discussion communities for major U.S. and Canadian colleges. This analysis reveals that students report feelings of self-doubt resulting from a competitive co-op job market, especially when placed in entry-level jobs that are not related to their academic programs, and anxiety due to job interviews, especially when they coincide with exams and other academic deadlines. Additionally, recent discussions frequently point out cancelled work terms due to the COVID-19 pandemic, creating even more competition, financial hardship, and pressure to make alternate academic or employment arrangements.","Parsa, Mohammad S.; Golab, Lukasz","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+media+mining+to+understand+the+impact+of+cooperative+education+on+mental+health","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Work - Integrated Learning; 22(4):521-537, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25156,""

"The Great American Pandemic Recovery: Tackling Systems of Inequality that Impede Full Latino Inclusion in the COVID-19 Response","The Depression-era Social Security system and the Fair Labor Standards Act offered retirement security and basic worker protections - like the minimum wage - to predominantly white office, industrial, and craft workers but excluded farm laborers, domestic workers, and other jobs largely held by Blacks and Latinos.3 When the Interstate Highway System, government-subsidized mortgages, and mortgage interest deduction fueled a massive increase in suburban homeownership after World War II, formal and informal housing discrimination relegated most Latino and Black families to poor-quality housing in segregated neighborhoods with few economic opportunities and under-resourced schools.4 The Great Society era of the 1960s led to the creation of critical support programs, including housing assistance, job training, Medicaid, and the Food Stamp program (SNAP's predecessor), but so-called ""alien exclusions"" soon followed, which bar most immigrants and their lawfully present spouses and children-predominantly Hispanic-from vital economic, health, and nutritional supports.5 The pandemic has exposed the unequal social and economic foundations on which communities of color must build their lives, in part due to decades of explicitly discriminatory policy decisions. COVID-19 and the Latino Community COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, and a national emergency by the United States on March 13, 2020.7 One year later, more than 29 million confirmed cases and 528,000 deaths were attributed to the disease in the United States.8 The nation's largest Latino civil rights organization, UnidosUS, was early in bringing attention to the disparate impact on Latino communities through original analysis, engagement with lawmakers, and more than 20 virtual community events that placed the disparate effects of the pandemic within the context of broader structural inequities.9 To be clear, the hundreds of thousands of COVID-related deaths are tragic, regardless of race or ethnicity. While no consistent evidence links school openings to surges in COVID-19 in general, children who live in poverty - 41 percent of whom are Latino - disproportionately attend schools with substandard facilities that undermine virus mitigation strategies and place students and staff at higher risk.14 These children are also more likely to live with an essential worker family member or in multigenerational housing, which also increases risk of exposure.15 Even as youth mortality rates re-main low compared to older patients, the potential long-term impacts of COVID-19 on an entire generation of Americans should spark significant concern among policymakers;research suggests the disease can lead to major organ damage, psychiatric disorders, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome.16 With such a disproportionate number of young Latinos falling ill, it is not unreasonable to assume that Latinos will also share an outsized burden of the disease's long-term health effects. Recent policy decisions-in response to COVID-19 and changes to the tax code - have expressly excluded many families living in mixed-immigration status households from accessing economic impact payments (stimulus checks) or antipoverty programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC).23 An estimated 5.5 million US citizens and green card holders did not receive stimulus checks under the CARES Act because they live in households where one member files taxes without a Social Security Number.24 Although income-eligible US citizens and green card holders were eventually included in the two most-recent pandemic relief packages, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, these changes only came after intense advocacy by organizations like UnidosUS and more than a year of millions of families struggling without support.","Guevara, Carlos, Ruskin, Emily","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Great+American+Pandemic+Recovery:+Tackling+Systems+of+Inequality+that+Impede+Full+Latino+Inclusion+in+the+COVID-19+Response","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy; 33:46-56, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-10","",25161,""
"Understanding factors contributing to burnout in private practice settings","Burnout for mental health professionals (such as psychologists, social workers, or professional counselors) can be a significant impact to their well-being and work with their clients. Participants (N = 113) who were mental health workers working in private practice, were randomly recruited to participate in this survey, which addressed the following research questions: Do mental health professionals in a solo practice experience different rates of burnout than those in a group practice setting? Does degree of burnout differ among mental health professionals based on years of experience or gender? Do the number and type of hours work influence rates of burnout among mental health professionals in private practice? Participants completed the survey by taking the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Lastly, participants were questioned about their usage of teletherapy and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their rate of burnout. No significant differences in rates of burnout were found based on gender or type of private practice (group or individual). Significant differences in burnout were noted based on the number and type of hours worked and years of experience. Given the rates of burnout from this research compared to rates of burnout in previous studies, further research will be needed to better understand the factors contributing to burnout and the influence of teletherapy and COVID-19.

"Evaluating the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) framework as a model of community participation for people with chronic health conditions and disabilities","Community participation is defined as an individual's engagement in meaningful life roles such as employment, parenting, education, recreation, interpersonal relation, religion, and healthy living (Iwanaga, Chen, et al., 2021). The ability to assume meaningful life roles and activities in the society is associated with better physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significant negative impacts on the disability community (Lund et al., 2020). COVID related challenges and stressors affecting people with chronic health conditions and disabilities include disruption of daily routines;financial difficulties;lack of access to healthcare, rehabilitation, and social services;unemployment;discrimination, physical inactivity;social isolation;and depression and anxiety. Helping people with disabilities gain control of their lives during and after the pandemic and assume meaningful life roles especially employment in the community may be more important than before.The purpose of the present study was to evaluate constructs of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as predictors of community participation. A convenient sample of 952 people with chronic health conditions and disabilities were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to participate in this study. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to answer the research question. For demographic covariates, age, marital status, educational attainment, and low income were significant predictors of community participation. Older adults and individuals who receive disability benefits were negatively associated with community participation, while individuals who are married and individuals with higher levels of educational attainment were positively associated with community participation. For impairments, pain intensity, perceived stress, and depression were significant predictors of lower levels of community participation. However, pain, stress, and depression were no longer significant in the presence of functional disability indicating that the negative effect of impairment on community participation is accounted for by functional disability. For functional disability (i.e., social-cognitive functioning and activities of daily living functioning), limitations in social-cognitive functioning and activities of daily living (ADL) functioning were significant predictors of lower levels of community participation, with limitations in ADL a stronger predictor than limitations in social-cognitive functioning. For person-environmental contextual factors, hope, core self-evaluations, social support, and environmental supports were positive predictors of community participation. Predictors in the final regression model accounted for 48% of the variance in community participation scores (a large effect size). The results support the utility of the ICF as a model of community participation for people with chronic health conditions and disabilities. Importantly, findings of the present study underscored the significant negative effect of functional disability on community participation. To help people with disabilities assuming meaningful life roles including employment in the community, rehabilitation psychologists and counselors must work with physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and assistive technology specialists to help clients maximize their physical health and functioning and provide psychosocial interventions to increase their personal strengths, social support, and mental health functioning.

"Life events and emotional disorder revisited: Research and clinical applications","Life Events and Emotional Disorder Revisited explores the variety of events that can occur, their inherent characteristics and how they affect our lives and emotions, and in turn their impact on our mental health and wellbeing. The book focuses on current social problems nationally and internationally, showing the reach of life events research including those linked to Covid-19. It also discusses trauma experiences and how they fit in the life events scheme. To underpin the various life event dimensions identified (such as loss, danger and humiliation), the authors have developed an underlying model of human needs, jeopardised by the most damaging life events. This includes attachment, security, identity and achievement. The book brings together classic research findings with new advances in the field of life events research, culminating in a new theoretical framework of life events, including new discussions on trauma, on positive events and an online methodology for measuring them. Additionally, it draws out the clinical implications to apply the research for improved practice. The book will be of interest to researchers, clinicians and students in psychology, psychiatry and psychotherapy in broadening their understanding of how life events impact on individuals and how this can be applied to enhance clinical practice and stimulate future research.
