"Post-covid medical complaints after SARS-CoV-2 Omicron vs Delta variants -a prospective cohort study","Objective: To examine whether persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant have an altered risk of post-covid complaints and healthcare use when compared to 1) persons testing negative, and 2) persons with delta. Design: Prospective cohort study with 126 days follow-up and a time-to-event approach. Setting: A registry-based study including Norwegian residents. Participants: All persons aged 18-70 years living in Norway and who had a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 (N=105 196, mean (SD) age 42 (14), 50% women)) or positive test with confirmed omicron variant (N=13 028, mean (SD) age 37 (13), 50% women) or delta variant (N=23 368, mean (SD) age 40 (12), 50% women) in December 2021. Individuals with hospital contacts or non-screened PCR test were excluded. Main outcome measures: Symptoms/complaints and diagnosis of musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, cough, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, anxiety/depression and brain fog at the general practitioner or emergency ward as recorded in national registries and as observed for the whole follow-up period as well as in periods 14-30 days, 30-90 days and 90 days or more. Results: Persons with omicron or delta had similarly increased risk of post-covid fatigue compared to persons testing negative, with a hazard ratio (HR)=1.21 (CI:1.10-1.33) for omicron and HR=1.26 (CI: 1.17-1.35) for delta, for up to 126 days after the test date. They also had an increased risk of shortness of breath (HR=1.43, CI, 1.14-1.80 and HR=1.70, CI, 1.46-1.98 for omicron and delta, respectively, relative to negative). Omicron was related with a similar, and no increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, cough, heart palpitations, anxiety/depression when compared to delta and when compared to test negative. The risk of complaints was similar for omicron and delta and decreased over time for the post-covid periods 14-30 days, 30-90 days and 90 days or more. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 omicron and delta infection are associated with similarly increased risks of post-covid complaints when compared to non-infected. The omicron variant will likely lead to a temporarily increased burden on healthcare services.","Karin Magnusson; Doris Tove Kristoffersen; Andrea Dell'Isola; Ali Kiadaliri; Aleksandra Turkiewicz; Jos Runhaar; Sita Bierma-Zeinstra; Martin Englund; Per Minor Magnus; Jonas Minet Kinge","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.23.22275445","20220525","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31898,""
"Depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A two-year follow-up","Background: There has been much research into the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it is related to time-invariant individual characteristics (e.g. age and gender). However, there is still a lack of research showing long-term trajectories of mental health across different stages of the pandemic. And little is known regarding the longitudinal association of time-varying contextual and individual factors (e.g. COVID-19 policy response and pandemic intensity) with mental health outcomes. This study aimed to provide a longitudinal profile of how depressive and anxiety symptoms changed by month between March 2020 and April 2022, and to examine their longitudinal associations with time-varying contextual and individual level factors. Methods and findings: Drawing data from a large panel study of over 58,000 adults living in England, we showed that mental health changes were largely in line with changes in COVID-19 policy response and pandemic intensity. Further, data were analysed using fixed-effects, with models fitted separately across three stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that more stringent policy response was associated with increased mental health symptoms, in particular during lockdown periods. Higher COVID-19 deaths were also associated with poorer mental health, but this association weakened over time. Finally, there was also evidence for the longitudinal association of mental health with individual level factors, including confidence in government/healthcare/essentials, COVID-19 knowledge, COVID-19 stress, COVID-19 infection and social support. Conclusions: Our results provided empirical evidence on how changes in contextual and individual level factors were related to depressive and anxiety symptoms. While some factors clearly acted as consistent predictors of mental health during a pandemic, other factors were dependent on the specific situations occurring within society. This could provide important implications for policy making and for a better understanding of mental health of the general public during a national or global health crisis.","Feifei Bu; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.24.22275529","20220525","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31899,""
"Covid-19 is a leading cause of death in children and young people ages 0-19 years in the United States","Covid-19 has caused more than 1 million deaths in the US, including at least 1,433 deaths among children and young people (CYP) aged 0-19 years. Deaths among US CYP are rare in general, and so we argue here that the mortality burden of Covid-19 in CYP is best understood in the context of all other causes of CYP death. Using publicly available data from the National Center for Health Statistics, and comparing to mortality in 2019, the immediate pre-pandemic period, we find that Covid-19 is a leading cause of death in CYP aged 0-19 years in the US, ranking #9 among all causes of deaths, #5 in disease related causes of deaths (excluding accidents, assault and suicide), and #1 in deaths caused by infectious / respiratory diseases. Due to the impact of mitigations such as social distancing and our comparison of a single disease (Covid-19) to groups of causes such as deaths from pneumonia and influenza, these rankings are likely conservative lower bounds. Our findings underscore the importance of continued vaccination campaigns for CYP over 5 years of age in the US and for effective Covid-19 vaccines for under 5 year olds.","Seth Flaxman; Charles Whittaker; Elizaveta Semenova; Theo Rashid; Robbie Parks; Alexandra Blenkinsop; H Juliette T Unwin; Swapnil Mishra; Samir Bhatt; Deepti Gurdasani; Oliver Ratmann","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.23.22275458","20220525","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31900,""
"Clearing the Fog: A Systematic Review on Cognitive Dysfunction in COVID-19","Objective: The systematic review aims to examine the association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction, including the link between the severity of COVID-19 and the occurrence of cognitive impairment and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms related to brain fog among COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, Oxford University Press, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, ScienceDirect, Ovid, HERDIN, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases were accessed to retrieve literature using the PRISMA guidelines. Results: After critical appraisal, thirteen full journal articles were included in the study. The studies showed the most frequent cognitive impairment are attention, memory, and executive function in COVID-19 patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC) in 3 out of 4 studies, cognitive impairment was only evident in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, two studies showed no correlation between brain fog and depression, and five studies showed a link between the severity of COVID-19 infection and cognitive impairment. Cases ranging from mild to severe illness presented manifestations of brain fog. However, a disparity in the evidence of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction exists, prompting the need to investigate further. Additionally, recent studies provide insufficient evidence for direct central nervous system invasion, and there are emerging studies that contrast the presumed pathogenesis of neurological complications from neuroinflammation. Conclusion: There is an association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction. Manifestation of cognitive dysfunction is present regardless of illness severity. Moreover, there are existing pathophysiological mechanisms of the Coronavirus that lead to cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 patients; however, additional studies are required to substantiate such mechanisms further.","Nicole D.

"CDC COVID-19 Response Health Equity Strategy: Accelerating Progress Towards Reducing COVID-19 Disparities and Achieving Health Equity","Guiding Principles Reduce health disparities. Use data-driven approaches. Foster meaningful engagement with community institutions and diverse leaders. Lead culturally responsive outreach. Reduce stigma, including stigma associated with race and ethnicity. Vision All people have the opportunity to attain the highest level of health possible. Charge To reduce the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among populations at increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death. To broadly address health disparities and inequities related to COVID-19 with a holistic, all-of-response approach. To develop a strategic plan to help us realize these goals. Overview Achieving health equity requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing efforts to address avoidable inequities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and healthcare disparities. The population health impact of COVID-19 has exposed longstanding inequities that have systematically undermined the physical, social, economic, and emotional health of racial and ethnic minority populations and other population groups that are bearing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19. Persistent health disparities combined with historic housing patterns, work circumstances, and other factors have put members of some racial and ethnic minority populations at higher risk for COVID-19 infection, severe illness, and death. As we continue to learn more about the impact of COVID-19 on the health of different populations, immediate action is critical to reduce growing COVID-19 disparities among the populations known to be at disproportionate risk. CDCâ€™s COVID-19 Response Health Equity Strategy broadly seeks to improve the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by focusing on four priorities: Expanding the evidence base. Expanding programs and practices for testing, contact tracing, isolation, healthcare, and recovery from the impact of unintended negative consequences of mitigation strategies in order to reach populations that have been put at increased risk. Examples of potential unintended negative consequences include loss of health insurance;food, housing, and income insecurity;mental health concerns;substance use;and violence resulting from factors like social isolation, financial stress, and anxiety. Expanding program and practice activities to support essential and frontline workers to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Examples of essential and frontline workers include healthcare, food industry, and correctional facility workers. Expanding an inclusive workforce equipped to assess and address the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. population.","Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/cdc-strategy.html","","Database: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31902,""

"Cellular and extracellular levels of retrovirus-host interactions on the example of the bovine leukose virus 2 critical stages - multiplicity and versatility (review)","The wide spread of viral infections and the ease of overcoming the species-specific barriers require the identification of critical stages in the virus interaction with multicellular organisms of mammals and the analysis of key molecular genetic systems involved. To date, a large amount of data has already been accumulated on the diversity and complexity of such systems, as well as the involvement in them the wide range of metabolic pathways. In this regard, attempts to identify some common elements that are implemented in different infectious processes are of particular relevance. This paper is such attempt made on the example of the analysis of the main events of cattle infection by bovine leukemia virus (BLV). Systems involved in the entry of BLV genetic material into the cytoplasm of host cells, the suppression of innate and adaptive immunity, as well as interactions between the genomes of the BLV provirus and the host genome are the identified critical stages. The direct participants in the reception of viral proteins are parts of some host tansmembrane systems (G.Yu. Kosovsky et al., 2017;V.I. Glazko et al., 2018;L. Bai et al., 2019;H. Sato et al., 2020). During virus reproduction in host cells, host enzymes modify virus envelope proteins by (A. De Brogniez et al., 2016;W. Assi et al., 2020). Importantly, modifications of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, as well as BLV envelope proteins, have a significant impact on their pathogenicity (M. Hoffmann et al., 2020). Pathogenicity and depressing effect of both BLV and SARS-CoV-2 on innate and adaptive immunity is realized in part through the activation of T regulatory cells and an increase in the expression of the growth transforming factor TGF-b (L.Y. Chang et al., 2015;G.Yu. Kosovsky et al., 2017;W. Chen et al., 2020). Intracellular mechanisms of protection against retrotranspositions, recombinations between viruses and host retrotransposons, the formation of new elements of host regulatory networks such as microRNAs, and the integration of proviral DNA into the host genome are closely related and controlled by interfering RNA (RNAi) systems with the key gene dicer1 (P.V. Maillard et al., 2019;E.Z. Poirier et al., 2021;G.Y. Kosovsky et al., 2020). These systems can provide a certain left-pointing-double-angle resistance right-pointing-double-angle of the host genome both to the integration of exogenous genetic material and to transpositions of own mobile genetic elements. Apparently, it is the polygenicity of the control of these critical stages of viral infection that leads to difficulties in predicting their development and developing methods for their prevention.","Glazko, V.

"Corporate leadership and its role in shaping organizational culture and performance","Increasing globalization, cutthroat competition, recurrent financial crises, emerging health crises (e.g. the coronavirus) and new social media technology strain companies to rethink the human practices. Such ever-growing business environment particularly calls upon companies to develop sustainable leadership practices and create a well-established organizational climate. By promoting organizational value system, the leader can influence the work behavior and attitudes of the employees and results. In this context, the present book proposes to investigate and understand the influence of corporate leadership on the organizational culture and performance from multi-disciplinary perspective. In other words, the aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive and in-depth multi-perspective analysis and lies at the crossroads of different theories (e.g. leadership theories, agency, theory, resource dependency theory and positive accounting theory) from different disciplines (e.g. corporate finance, behavioral finance and management). From managerial perspective, for instance, leadership can shape culture by developing skills such as creating personal credibility and establishing trusted relationships. Thereby, leadership styles (transformational leadership, in particular) can build greater innovation and satisfactory organizational culture and lead to organizational effectiveness. Based on this crux, a leader can affect employees in achieving better organizational performance and influence business results (i.e. long-term financial performance). That is why, from this perspective, it is important to determine how leadership and management decisions and styles affect organizational culture and apprehend whether leadership influences (employee, organizational, financial) performance. From corporate finance perspective, it is interesting to investigate the impact of CEO/Director behavior on firm performance across the world based on different financial theories. This can lead to better apprehend the strategic role of CEO/Director for firm sustainability and provide bigger picture of CEO/Director role and practices around the world.

"Digital healthcare for airway diseases from personal environmental exposure (Special Issue: Non-contact healthcare / digital healthcare)","Digital technologies have emerged in various dimensions of human life, ranging from education to professional services to wellbeing. In particular, health products and services have expanded by the use and development of artificial intelligence, mobile health applications, and wearable electronic devices. Such advancements have enabled accurate and updated tracking and modeling of health conditions. For instance, digital health technologies are capable of measuring environmental pollution and predicting its adverse health effects. Several health conditions, including chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can be exacerbated by pollution. These diseases impose substantial health burdens with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, efforts have been made to develop digital technologies to alleviate such conditions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the application of telemedicine and telemonitoring for patients with chronic airway diseases. This article reviews current trends and studies in digital technology utilization for investigating and managing environmental exposure and chronic airway diseases. First, we discussed the recent progression of digital technologies in general environmental healthcare. Then, we summarized the capacity of digital technologies in predicting exacerbation and self-management of airway diseases. Concluding these reviews, we provided suggestions to improve digital health technologies' abilities to reduce the adverse effects of environmental exposure in chronic airway diseases, based on personal exposure-response modeling.","Park, Youngmok, Lee, ChanHo, Jung, JiYe","https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2022.63.S1","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Yonsei Medical Journal; 63(Suppl):S1-S13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31910,""
"Videoconferencing-based cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic","The need for psychosocial intervention programmes to address the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown restrictions on the mental health of young people is evident. Using a within subject pretest-posttest design, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)-based anxiety and depression management psychoeducation programmes on mental health and coping skills in youth ages 14â€“20. The Demographic Information Form, Revised Child Anxiety Depression Scale, and KidCope were administered before and after the psychoeducational programme to assess programme outcomes. The results indicate significant decreases in levels of anxiety, significant decreases in avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations and significant increases in coping skills following the online CBT Anxiety Management Psychoeducation Program. A significant decrease in depression scores was noted among the online CBT Depression Management Psychoeducation Program participants. Although these results should be interpreted cautiously due to limitations of the study (e.g., no control group, high attrition), they suggest that psychological prevention or intervention programmes may be beneficial for young people who are physically unable to go to school or who cannot interact face-to-face with social support networks.

Some states implemented more restrictive policies, some less or did not require many restrictions (i.e., stay at home orders or masking in public spaces). Video-based online focus groups with foster parents in four states utilized a consensual qualitative approach to identify themes relating to foster parenting during COVID-19 and understand how policies related to COVID-19 restrictions affected their caregiving decisions. Themes that emerged included pathways to foster parenting pre-pandemic, the impact of COVID-19 on both foster parents, children in care, and foster parents' ability to understand the broader importance of their caregiving. While participants in all of the states reported similar experiences relating to the need for resources and support and the challenge of managing both work and remote education for their children, those in states with restrictive policies were more likely to report pandemic-specific concerns including a lack of agency communication or case progress, the mental health toll on foster children in their care and their concerns about accepting new placements. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

"Psychological distress in the time of COVID-19: The relationship between anxiety, hopelessness, and depression and the mediating role of sense of coherence","Although the COVID-19 pandemic can precipitate a wide range of mental health problems, not everyone experiences significant psychological distress. Instead, many people are able to adapt effectively to difficult life circumstances, which suggests the influence of specific protective factors. The current study investigated sense of coherence (SOC) as a potential protective factor and examined both its direct association with depression and its mediating role in the hopelessness-depression and anxiety-depression relationships. Participants were 337 young adults who completed 4 self-report questionnaires, namely, the Sense of Coherence Scale-Short Form (SOC-13) scale, Centre for Epidemiological Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale. In addition to descriptive statistics and intercorrelations, structural equation modeling was used to determine the mediating role of SOC. The results suggest that levels of anxiety, hopelessness, and depression exceed those documented in the existing literature in other contexts. Higher SOC was associated with less psychological distress. SOC also mediated the relationship between anxiety and depression and between hopelessness and depression, supporting the notion that it serves a health-sustaining role in psychological outcome. These findings suggest that SOC is health sustaining and strategies aimed at promoting cognitive flexibility and enhancing awareness of coping resources may prove beneficial in preventing adverse psychological outcomes.

"Minority stress, pandemic stress, and mental health among gender diverse young adults: Gender dysphoria and emotion dysregulation as mediators","Gender diverse people in the United States are uniquely vulnerable to deleterious health outcomes because of long-enshrined systems of oppression and marginalization in American society. Trans young adults are especially vulnerable to these deleterious outcomes owing to their unique position in the life course. However, more research is needed on the mechanisms through which this marginalization contributes to mental health disparities in trans populations. Using a minority stress framework and online cross-sectional survey design, the current study examines potential mediators of the relationship between transgender identity-related distal stress and psychological distress from late May to early July 2020 in a sample of transgender young adults (N = 239;ages 18-29). More than half the sample scored above the K6 cutoff for severe psychological distress. Distal stress had a significant direct (beta = .17, SE = .04, t = 2.76, p = .006) and indirect effect on psychological distress. Distal stress was indirectly associated with psychological distress through gender dysphoria (beta = .04;95% CI [.001, .10]) and emotion dysregulation (beta = .16;95% CI [.09, .23]). COVID-19 pandemic stressors were also positively associated with psychological distress (beta = .36, SE = .12, t = 5.95, p &lt; .001). Results highlight the significant mental health burden facing the trans community especially in the COVID-19 context, support a conceptualization of gender dysphoria as connected to experiences of oppression, and affirm the relevance of emotion dysregulation within minority stress frameworks. Mental health resources cognizant of the specific challenges experienced by trans young adults as well as policy changes that seek to address underlying structural transphobia in American culture and institutions are urgently needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement This study surveying young adults with minority gender identities found (a) high rates of psychological distress during COVID-19, (b) that pandemic stress was associated with greater psychological distress, and (c) transphobic discrimination was associated with greater gender dysphoria and emotion dysregulation, which were both associated with greater psychological distress. This highlights the mechanisms underlying trans health disparities and the importance of recognizing transphobic/cisnormative experiences and systems of oppression when conducting research, creating policies, and/or providing services to support the transgender community.

"Religious/spiritual struggles and depression during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in the global south: Evidence of moderation by positive religious coping and hope","Physical and existential threats stemming from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may provoke religious/spiritual (R/S) struggles or exacerbate preexisting angst and questions. In the Global South, where pervasive social-structural disadvantages limit resource availability to mitigate psychosocial consequences, doubts about divine presence and purpose amidst suffering, loss, and uncertainty may be especially salient factors in spiritual and mental health. With two independent samples of Colombians and South Africans recruited during an early phase of lockdown in each country, the current set of studies (N Study 1 = 1,172;N Study 2 = 451) examined positive religious coping (Study 1) and state hope (Study 2) as potential resources that may support the mental health of people living in the Global South who experienced R/S struggles during the public health crisis. Results of hierarchical regression analyses across both studies revealed that R/S struggles were positively associated with depression. In Study 1, there was a two-way interaction between R/S struggles and positive religious coping, such that the relation between R/S struggles and depression was attenuated when positive religious coping was higher for both men and women. In Study 2, a three-way interaction emerged among R/S struggles, state hope, and gender;R/S struggles were associated with higher levels of depression when state hope was low in women and when state hope was high in men. We discuss the implications of these findings for promoting psychological and spiritual well-being in low- and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Guide to providing culturally competent behavioral health services via telehealth","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic thrust the United States into an unprecedented mental health crisis prompting the rapid emergence of telehealth as a critical platform for mental health service delivery. Government imposed safety precautions limiting face-to-face contact to control spread of infection contributed to isolation, fear of illness, death, job loss, and existing psychological distress. As remote service delivery continues to offer a viable alternative to traditional in-person care, the growing diversity of the U.S. population demands culturally competent mental health practices. Notably, multicultural and diversity issues and patient identity markers may not be as apparent through digital platforms as they would be in person. This article aims to provide culturally responsive recommendations for practitioners delivering telehealth services. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement As multicultural diversity in telehealth services has become an important professional and societal need, this guide provides detailed suggestions and guidance for practitioners on essential considerations in providing behavioral telehealth services to culturally diverse patient communities.

"The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on stress and anxiety in dentistry students (preprint)","Objectives:  To investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on stress and anxiety in preclinical and clinical dentistry students. Materials:  and Methods: Dentistry students in clinical course(CC;n=64) or preclinical course(PCC;n=53) were included. The subjective perceived levels of stress and anxiety were evaluated using the Dental Environment Stress(DES) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales(DASS) questionnaire. Cortisol levels were measured in saliva samples. Knowledge of the pandemic was evaluated. All data were collected twice: during the university holidays and during term time. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to compare data between baseline and follow-up. Multivariate linear regression models were computed to analyze possible influencing factors. Results: : Participants showed medium levels of stress and anxiety at baseline and follow-up. The DASS score in the â€˜anxietyâ€™ subdomain was significantly higher in the PCC group than in the CC group at baseline(p&lt;0.001) and increased during term time. Mean saliva cortisol levels were higher in the CC group(9.2Â±5.2) than in the PCC group(4.9Â±2.2) at baseline(p&lt;0.001) but converged by follow-up. Intra-individual perception of stress at baseline was consistently the most important aspect for changes in stress and anxiety levels during term time. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected stress and anxiety levels in some participants, but this was not ubiquitous. Conclusion:  Intra-individual differences in stress perception seem to be more relevant than course affiliation (preclinical or clinical) or the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to stress and anxiety levels in dentistry students. A follow-up study when the pandemic is over would be useful to control for stress under normal circumstances. Clinical Relevance: These results highlight the importance of individual stress management in dentistry students.","ZenthÃ¶fer, Andreas, Graf, Andreas, Rammelsberg, Peter, Klotz, Anna-Luisa","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1593288/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31918,""
"An explanatory model of depressive symptoms from anxiety, post-traumatic stress, somatic symptoms and symptom perception: The role of inflammatory markers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a bigger problem for mental health in the world. The aim of this study was to propose a model of mental health variables in hospitalized patients of COVID-19 and determine which model explained best the depression symptoms in both groups with and without biological response. Method:  We conducted a cross sectional study, following a simple random sampling. Data from 277 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Lima-Peru, were collected to assess mental health variables (i.e., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, somatic symptoms), self-perception of COVID-19 related symptoms, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) such as inflammatory marker. By performing a structural equation modeling analysis as a technique to evaluate a predictive model of depression. Results: : The results showed a prevalence of depressive symptoms (11.2%), anxious symptoms (7.9%), somatic symptoms (2.2%), and symptoms of post-traumatic stress (6.1%) in the overall sample. No association was found between the prevalence of these mental health problems among people with and without severe inflammatory response. The mental health indicators with the highest prevalence were sleep problems (48%), low energy (47.7%), nervousness (48.77%), worry (47.7%), irritability (43.7%) and back pain (52%) in the overall sample. The model proposed to explain depressive symptoms was able to explain more than 83.7% of the variance and presented good goodness-of-fit indices. Also, a different performance between the proposed model was found between people with and without severe inflammatory response, mainly in the relationship between anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and between the perception of COVID-19 related symptoms and somatic symptoms. Conclusions: : Results demonstrated that our model of mental health variables may explain depression in hospitalized patients of COVID-19 from a third-level hospital in Peru. In the model, perception of symptoms influences somatic symptoms, which influence both anxiety symptoms and post-traumatic stress. Thus, anxious symptoms could directly influence depressive symptoms or through post-traumatic stress. Our findings could be useful to decision-makers for the prevention of depression, using screening tools (i.e. perception of symptoms, somatic symptoms, anxiety) to identify vulnerable patients early.","Villarreal-Zegarra, David, Paredes-Angeles, RubÃ­, Mayo-Puchoc, Nikol, Vilela-Estada, Ana Lucia, Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff, Copez-Lonzoy, Anthony","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1544017/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31919,""
"Mental health outcomes following COVID-19 infection: Evidence from 11 UK longitudinal population studies (preprint)","Background Evidence on associations between COVID-19 illness and mental health is mixed. We examined longitudinal associations between COVID-19 and mental health while considering: 1) pre-pandemic mental health, 2) time since infection;3) subgroup differences;and 4) confirmation of infection via self-reported test, and serology data. Methods Using data from 11 UK longitudinal studies, involving 54,442 participants, with 2 to 8 repeated measures of mental health and COVID-19 between April 2020 and April 2021, we standardised continuous mental health scales within each study across time. We investigated associations between COVID-19 (self-report, test-confirmed, serology-confirmed) and mental health using multilevel generalised estimating equations. We examined whether associations varied by age, sex, ethnicity, education and pre-pandemic mental health. Effect-sizes were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. Outcomes Pooled estimates of the standardized difference in outcome between those with and without self-reported COVID-19 suggested associations with subsequent psychological distress (0.10 [95%CI: 0.06;0.13], I 2 =42.8%), depression (0.08 [0.05;0.10], I 2 =20.8%), anxiety (0.08 [0.05;0.10], I 2 =0%), and lower life satisfaction (-0.06 [-0.08;-0.04], I 2 =29.2%). Associations did not vary by time since infection until 3+ months and were present in all age groups, with some evidence of stronger effects in those aged 50+. Self-reported COVID-19, whether suspected or test-confirmed and irrespective of serology status, was associated with poorer mental health. Interpretation Self-reporting COVID-19 was longitudinally associated with deterioration in mental health and life satisfaction.

The instruments used were the self-report questionnaire, the suicide risk assessment scale, and the family APGAR. Data analysis was performed using the artificial intelligence algorithm (gower clustering).Â  Results: : 246 adolescents responded to the three instruments, which made it possible to select those with correlations of sensitive interest and, based on these, an intervention plan. Psychological distress was found in 28%, psychotic symptoms in 85%, and problematic alcohol use in 9%. Good family functioning was identified in 34% and some type of family dysfunction in 66%. In terms of suicide risk, there was a low suicide risk of 74%, 24% medium risk, and 2% high risk. It could be shown that there is a correlation in a group of 15% of the respondents.Â  Conclusions: : The risk of suffering mental health deterioration and the suicide risk, during this pandemic period, seems to be related to family functionality.","Rojas-Torres, Indiana-Luz, Ahmad, Mostapha Ahmad, MartÃ­n Ãlvarez, Juan Manuel, Golpe, Antonio, Gil Herrera, Richard de JesÃºs","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.109603.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31921,""

METHODS: The aim of this study is to examine differences in clinical symptoms and psychological distress comparing two groups of university students seeking psychological intervention at a University Psychological Counselling Center before the COVID-19 pandemic period and during the pandemic. A sample of 187 students was distributed into two groups: Pre-COVID-19 pandemic (n = 115) and COVID-19 Pandemic (n = 72). The Personality Inventory-Brief Form for DSM-5 was used to measure personality traits;the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised was used to assess clinical symptoms and the Outcome Questionnaire-45 explored important psychological distress. RESULTS Findings highlighted higher levels of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 pandemic students than in pre-pandemic ones. Conversely, the two groups did not differ in psychological distress. Data seems to confirm that the pandemic period had a negative impact on the mental health of university students seeking psychological help. CONCLUSION Findings indicate the need to monitor the clinical symptomatology of university students to prevent long-term psychopathology influencing academic functioning.","R, Cerutti, V, Spensieri, S, Amendola, Gs, Biuso, A, Renzi, A, Gambardella, R, Tambelli","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1648500/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31922,""
"Forest Bathing and Hiking benefits for mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic in Mediterranean regions (preprint)","Forest Bathing (FB) is a nature-therapeutic modality that has evidenced positive effects on individualsâ€™ mental health and it is also considered a sustainable touristic activity. However, its benefits have mainly been studied in Asian biomes and more cross-cultural research is needed to evaluate if its benefits are also generalizable to other forests and biomes of the world, such as the Mediterranean. Accordingly, 86 healthy adults of the general population were assessed before and after a FB near Barcelona (Spain) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A control hiking-group of participants was also analysed to contrast the FB effects on anxiety, affect, mood states and mindfulness. Results have shown that the guided practice of FB in Mediterranean-Catalan forests enhances significanlty mindfulness states and positive affect and reduces anxiety and negative affect, with effect sizes being large to very large. Hiking also induced significant changes in all variables tested, but FB showed higher effect sizes. An exploratory analysis also revealed a different profile of the FB participants compared to the hiking practitioners, being highly educated women living in urban areas and with lower basal levels of psychological wellbeing. Accordingly, it is concluded that both Mediterranean FB and hiking (to a lesser degree), might be cost-effective strategies to promote and restore psychological well-being after the Covid-19 pandemic and to promote sustainable tourism in Mediterranean biomes of the European forested and protected areas.","Muro, Anna, Mateo, Corel, Parrado, Eva, Subirana-Malaret, Montse, Moya, Montserrat, Garriga, AdriÃ , Canals, Josep, Chamarro, AndrÃ©s, Sanz, Antoni","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1569769/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31923,""
"Enabling mental health task-sharing: A collective case study of undergraduate clinical associate training programmes in South Africa (preprint)","Background:  There is a shortage of the human resources needed to deliver mental health services in South Africa which is likely to be exacerbated by COVID-19. Due to mental health workforce shortages, task-shifting and task-sharing approaches have been implemented in other countries. Clinical associates, a mid-level cadre working under the supervision of medical practitioners, could play a role in delivering mental health services but it is not clear if they are adequately prepared . This study explored the mental health curriculum content of the undergraduate clinical associate training programmes in South Africa. Methods: : A qualitative collective case study approach was utilised for this multisite study at the three universities in South Africa offering clinical associate degrees. The study consisted of in-depth interviews utilising videoconferencing of individuals involved in each programme and a document review. Thematic analysis of the data was conducted. Results: : Nineteen interviews were conducted. Mental health formed part of the curriculum in all three programmes with the bulk of the training taking place in the final year of the three-year degree. Facility-based training ranged from two weeks to four weeks with one university only using hospitals with mental health units while two universities used hospitals at which the students were based for the year regardless of potential mental health exposure they would receive. The list of curricula inclusions extended to seldom-seen conditions. The quality of training and supervision appeared site-dependant and only one university set minimum experiential targets. Conclusions: : There is a basis on which to build the competencies and skills regarding mental health in this cadre. A training model that integrates mental health early in the undergraduate curriculum, focuses on common conditions and those with high disease burden, includes time in a mental health unit, provides facility-based trainers with detailed guidance to improve standardisation, and includes specific experiential targets that are monitored will enhance the potential utility of this cadre.","Moodley, Saiendhra Vasudevan, Wolvaardt, Jacqueline, Grobler, Christoffel","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1638548/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31924,""
"Implementation of a prehospital-initiated redirection program for patients with low-acuity conditions: an 18-month retrospective cohort study (preprint)","Objectives:  This study aims to describe the profile of patients and the barriers encountered in implementing an emergency medical services (EMS)-initiated redirection program to non-emergency department (ED) settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study. All EMS interventions during which the coordinating redirection centre (Capitale-Nationale, Quebec, Canada) was called were reviewed. The centre was available weekdays during working hours. On a voluntary basis, the on-site emergency medical technician (EMT) had the opportunity to contact the redirection centre to initiate diversion of patients with non-urgent conditions to a non-ED setting. Results Between April 27th, 2020, and October 26th, 2021, 2741 calls were received at the redirection centre, of which 1206 patients were finally diverted. Most redirected patients were female (62.0%) and 73.2% were aged = 60 years old. The initial 911 Medical Dispatch Priority Systems (MDPS) codes of those redirected were sick person (37.3%) and falls (11.3%) while 58.9% were initially considered as low ambulance priority level (P4, P7). The main complaints of redirected patients were non-traumatic lower limb pain (17.8%), back pain (12.0%), neurologic disorder (8.3%), mental-health related condition (7.9%), skin disorder (6.7%) and fall (6.5%). Patients were most frequently redirected to a general practice clinic (45.1%), a community-based resource (20.1%) or their own family physician (11.9%). The main reasons for not redirecting, available for 1112 interventions, were the potential for deterioration (88.8%), patient not consenting to be redirected (7.2%) and no outpatient clinic availability (4.9%). Conclusions A redirection program initiated by EMTs was implemented in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: predictors of vaccination resistance in young adults in Spain (preprint)","Rationale: widespread population vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a matter ofgreat interest to public health managers as it is the main pharmacological measureto contain the COVID-19 epidemic. Hesitancy or reluctance to vaccination hasbecome one of the main barriers to containing the pandemic. The young adultpopulation appears as one of the population clusters with the greatest reluctance tovaccination, even in countries such as Spain, one of those with the highestvaccination rate during this pandemic. Objective: the aim of this study was to identify the main predictive factors of vaccinationintention and profile people with hesitancy/reluctance to vaccinate againstSARS-CoV-2 virus in young adults living in Spain during the pandemic. Method: a cross-sectional study was carried out based on the administration of an onlineform (PSY-COVID-2) that evaluated the intention of vaccination together with a widerange of sociodemographic, social, cognitive, behavioral and affective variables in asample of 2210 young adults. Results: 14% of the young adults sample showed hesitancy/reluctance to vaccination at thebeginning of their vaccination campaign. Pearson`s product-moment correlationrevealed that a total of 35 factors of a heterogeneous nature were associated withthe intention to vaccinate. Analysis of variance showed that belonging to healthpersonnel, threat to personal health, tolerance of confinement, favorable attitude tomobility restrictions, to preventive measures, to the vaccine and to the public systemresponse, trust in the government and health/science experts, personality(extraversion and agreeableness), time and quality of information about COVID-19,and coping strategy of seeking emotional support were conditions associated withthe intention to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, conspiratorial thinkingabout COVID-19, availability of public resources for mental health, good post-pandemic mood, and coping strategies of seeking family support and substance use were conditions associated with hesitancy/reluctance to vaccination. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that a reduced set of 4 attitudinal and social variables explained 41% of the variability in vaccination intention: attitude towards vaccination, trust in health/science experts, conspiracy ideations and time spent on information about COVID-19. A discriminant analysis showed that these 4 variables had good sensitivity and specificity when classifying people as reluctant/not reluctant to vaccination, properly classifying 86% of people. Conclusions: psychosocial processes related to attitudes, trust and information are the main predictors of vaccination intention in a highly reluctant group such as the young adult population.","Mateo-Canedo, Corel, Sanabria, Juan Pablo, Comendador, Laura, Rojas, Juan Sebastian, Carmona-CervellÃ³, Meritxell, Puig, Neus Crespo, Soler, Albert Feliu, Cardoner, Narcis, Yela, Joan Deus, Muro, Anna, Selva-Olid, Clara, MÃ©ndez-Ulrich, Jorge, Sanz, Antoni","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5gceu","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31926,""
"Staying Strong, But for How Long? Mental Health During COVID-19 in Italy (preprint)","A recent literature investigating mental health consequences of social distancing measures, has found a substantial increase in self-reported sleep and anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms during lockdown periods. These evidence are in contrast with the results we obtain using data on monthly purchases of psychiatric drugs by the universe of Italian pharmacies over the period of interest. We argue that this discrepancy has three potential causes: i) use of non-pharmaceutical therapies and non-medical solutions during lockdown periods;ii) unmet needs due to both demand- and supply-side shortages in healthcare services and iii) the subjectivity of self-assessed psychological health in survey studies, capturing also mild mental distress which might not evolve into mental disorder needing pharmacological treatment. This last point seems to be confirmed by lack of statistical significance of any measure of mobility change and reason of mobility (which we proxy with mobile phone data) on antidepressants and anxiolytics purchases during the entire 2020 period.","Marazzi, Francesca, Piano Mortari, Andrea, Belotti, Federico, CarrÃ , Giuseppe, Cattuto, Ciro, Kopinska, Joanna Aleksandra, Paolotti, Daniela, Atella, Vincenzo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Staying+Strong,+But+for+How+Long?+Mental+Health+During+COVID-19+in+Italy+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31927,""
"Mental Health Effects of COVID-19 Media Exposure Are Amplified in the United States Compared to Italy (preprint)","Background: Prolonged media exposure is widely shown to have adverse effects on peopleâ€™s mental health. Do these effects show variation across different countries? In the present study, we compared the link between media exposure and mental health-related outcomes in the United States and Italy, two countries with high levels of early COVID-19 prevalence. Method: Participants matched on age and gender in the United States (n = 415) and Italy (n = 442) completed assessments of media exposure, stress, anxiety, COVID-19 worry, and other variables in August 2020. Results: Media exposure was strongly linked with stress, anxiety, and COVID-19 worry, net of the effects of neuroticism, political identification, and demographics. We also observed Country x Media exposure interactions in the prediction of stress and COVID-19 worry.

"Well-Being and COVID-19 Worry: Divergent Effects through Social Interaction and Depression in a Cross-National Study (preprint)","Can worrying about COVID-19 have positive consequences for well-being? In a preregistered study, we examined the effect of worries about COVID-19 on well-being through divergent associations with social interaction and depression. In August 2020, participants from high and low prevalence regions in the United States and Italy (N = 857) completed assessments of COVID-19 worry, social interaction, depression, and well-being. Worries about COVID-19 predicted both more social interaction and more depression. In mediational analyses, an adaptive pathway of COVID-19 worry through social interaction was associated with higher well-being, whereas a maladaptive pathway through depression was associated with lower well-being. Further, a comparison of high and low COVID-19 prevalence regions replicated the mediational findings for social interaction, providing evidence against reverse causation and common method variance. Findings suggest that normative worries about acute stressors can both benefit and undermine well-being, depending on their impact on social behavior or depression.","Mancini, Anthony, Prati, Gabriele","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/h8y4c","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31929,""

"Depression and anxiety among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: A systematic review protocol (preprint)","Some studies point to a high mental health burden among children and adolescents (CA) during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly concerning depression and anxiety (DA). However, the quality of existing studies and some results are heterogeneous. Research gaps exist regarding (1) a high-quality summarizing overview on studies with (2) a pre-pandemic baseline on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on DA among CA in Europe. Therefore, the planned systematic review (SR) aims to close these gaps. SR was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and the protocol was prepared in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. Search strategy was peer reviewed. Systematic search was conducted in six databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and WHO COVID-19 database). Risk of bias (RoB) will be assessed using the RoB instrument for non-randomized studies of exposures. Certainty of evidence will be evaluated by using the GRADE approach adapted to the use of non-randomized studies. Also, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias will be performed.Results of this SR could contribute to determine the actual overall prevalence of DA among CA in European countries with an expert opinion on the clinical relevance and extrapolation of DA in CA in the next years. In addition, it aims identifying geographic and pandemic-policy differences and designate particularly vulnerable risk groups within European CA.","Ludwig-Walz, Helena, Dannheim, Indra, Pfadenhauer, Lisa, Fegert, JÃ¶rg, Bujard, Martin","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1638547/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31931,""
"Solving for Law Firm Inclusion: The Necessity of Lawyer Well-Being (preprint)","Chances are, in a room of one hundred law firm partners in the United States, at most, one Black woman would be present. Statistically, if there were a Black, Latinx, or Asian woman in that room, she would be the only one. Women of color make up only 3.79 percent of all partners, counting equity and nonequity partners. The percentage of Black women among all partners has remained solidly under one percentâ€”0.57 percent in 2009 and 0.80 percent in 2020. And so, women of color lawyers starting at law firms inevitably enter spaces that are overwhelmingly white and maleâ€”spaces where their well-being is not understood, much less prioritized. These same spaces are also home to a significant level of stress, substance abuse, and depression, rendering the law firm business ill-equipped to be welcoming and supportive. Attrition ensues and underrepresentation continues. To evolve into truly inclusive workplaces, law firms must act to embed lawyer well-being as an institutional piece of their diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. For law firms, the â€œracial reckoningâ€ and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020â€“2021, with negative impacts falling disproportionately on women of color lawyers, have only complicated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and well-being challenges. This Article proposes that law firms take concrete steps to solidify a holistic, interconnected approach to well-being and inclusion. Part II will provide an overview of the state of lawyer well-being and the representation of women of color lawyers at law firms. Part III will explore the impact of the events of 2020â€“21 on women of color lawyers. Part IV will highlight and critique recent law firm efforts on well-being and DEI. Part V will chart a path forward for law firms that treats well-being as inextricable from inclusion.","Lee, Katrina","https://www.google.com/search?q=Solving+for+Law+Firm+Inclusion:+The+Necessity+of+Lawyer+Well-Being+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31932,""
"Tsunami: Recommitting to Address AAPI Mental Health in a Post-COVID Era (preprint)","For too many in the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, this past year has been one of particular hardships: a global pandemic that caused suffering at home and abroad, political and social unrest, economic hardship, and an ongoing series of violent attacks on Asian Americans. Some health experts warn that this COVID pandemic will be followed by widespread mental health issues caused by the stressors that the pandemic has causedâ€”social isolation, the economic anxiety, and political and social unrest that have engulfed our collective psyche. But again, for many communities of color, these stressors only brought to light disparities in our healthcare system, particularly our mental health system. As policymakers and stakeholders envision a new system, particularly for mental health, in a post-pandemic world, we should add our voices for a more equitable system by calling out the circumstances facing the Asian American community. This is a pivotal time to not only address the coming â€œsecond pandemicâ€ of mental health issues brought about by the COVID pandemic but also to rebuild the healthcare system and address systemic changes that have long needed attention. Like many other communities of color, AAPI communities are no strangers to understanding racism as a public health issue, and the pandemic has exacerbated such underlying tensions, not necessarily generated new ones. Like other communities of color, the history of AAPIs in the United States is complicated, running the gamut as explored below between outright exclusion to elevation as a model minority and a wedge for identity politics. For instance, economic anxieties about China as well as scapegoating of Asian American-owned businesses parallel the nativism that led to events ranging from the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act to the Vincent Chin murder. In building that more equitable system, this paper will discuss three interconnectedâ€”but not necessarily exhaustiveâ€” issues to facilitate a more equitable mental health system post-pandemic: Asian cultural attitudes towards mental health, AAPIsâ€™ station as a community of color, and understanding the long-term impact of the COVID pandemic on the community. The paper will then turn to recommendations to not only addressing the mental health needs of the AAPI community in the wake of COVID and the uptick in violence but also bringing greater equity into mental health services for all communities of color. For example, recently Congress passed the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, an important part of responding. But some critics argue that the law does not address the underlying causes of anti-Asian sentiment nor the needs of the community.","Kim, Oliver","https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsunami:+Recommitting+to+Address+AAPI+Mental+Health+in+a+Post-COVID+Era+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31933,""

Using methodology established in prior studies, we combine age-specific fertility and excess death estimates from January 2020 to May 2022. We find 10.4 million children have lost a parent or caregiver due to COVID-associated excess deaths, and 7.5 million children have experienced COVID-associated orphanhood. Without supportive intervention, caregiver loss can bring severe risks of poverty, school dropout, sexual exploitation, and mental health distress.

"Psychological Well-Being among Saudi Adults During the Context of COVID-19 Lockdown: A Psychometric Analysis of the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (preprint)","Background:  Most communities' mental health and perceptions of psychological well-being are known to be profoundly disrupted by large-scale pandemics. Despite the wide range of available screening measures, there are few reliable and valid screening measures for detecting psychological symptoms in non-clinical populations during a health emergency situation such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective:  This study aims to conduct a psychometric analysis of Goldberg's 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to validate its use among a sample of Saudi adults during the context of COVID-19 lockdown using reliability and factor analyses. Methods: : 473 individuals (aged 18 years and over) were recruited and taken from the general Saudi population living in Makkah province of Saudi Arabia to complete the virtual format of the Arabic GHQ-12 (Ar-GHQ-12). In addition to descriptive statistics and reliability analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to examine the factorial structure of the Arabic GHQ-12. Results: : In line with previous works from several cultures, the Ar-GHQ-12 was found to have high reliability (a = .859) and considered the two-factor solution to be the best-fitting model because it fits the data better than the one-factor (unidimensional) model. Discussion:  It was determined that the Ar-GHQ-12 is suitable for assessing the psychological well-being of the general non-psychiatric population in Saudi Arabia in emergency contexts and may be applied in Saudis and other Arabic-speaking populations in research and busy primary care settings.","Hamad, Eradah","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1591586/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31935,""

Methods We invited UAE hospitals, academic institutions, CVD associations, paramedical organizations, and research institutions to nominate CV experts for participation in a pair of virtual workshops during the COVID-19 lockdown. Using the 4-step Nominal Group Technique, we assisted thirty seven (37) delegates to develop a set of research priorities on CVD mortalities. The process included 10-minute silent idea-generation exercise, a Round-Robin online recording of bulleted ideas, 45-minute individual presentations of ideas, and finally voting instantly via an electronic platform. Results Participants generated 138 thoughts during the 2-day workshops. Afterwards, ideas were categorized by priority order into 5 main research themes: the development of evidence-based customized algorithms for CVD prevention and in-hospital emergency interventions;the availability, accessibility, and affordability of CVD treatment and rehabilitation;the identification of relationships between CVD, life style, and mental health;the efficacy and constraints in the management of cardiac emergencies;and finally epidemiological studies that trace CV illnesses in the UAE.

"Effects of social support on depression risk during the COVID-19 pandemic: What support types and for whom? (preprint)","Background Rates of depression have increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. One known protective factor for depression is social support, but more work is needed to quantify the extent to which social support could reduce depression risk during a global crisis, and specifically to identify which types of support are most helpful, and who might benefit most. Methods Data were obtained from participants in the All of Us Research Program who responded to the CO VID-19 P articipant E xperience (COPE) survey administered monthly from May 2020 to July 2020 (N=69,066, 66% female). Social support was assessed using 10 items measuring emotional/informational support (e.g., someone to confide in or talk to about yourself or your problems), positive social interaction support (e.g., someone to do things with to help you get your mind off things), and tangible support (e.g., someone to help with daily chores if sick). Elevated depression symptoms were defined based on having a moderate-to-severe (=10) score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to test associations across time between overall social support and its subtypes with depression, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. We then assessed interactions between social support and potential effect modifiers: age, sex, pre-pandemic mood disorder, and pandemic-related stressors (e.g., financial insecurity). Results Approximately 16% of the sample experienced elevated depressive symptoms. Overall social support was associated with significantly reduced odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio, aOR [95% CI]=0.44 [0.42-0.45]). Among subtypes, emotional/informational support (aOR=0.42 [0.41-0.43]) and positive social interactions (aOR=0.43 [0.41-0.44]) showed the largest protective associations with depression, followed by tangible support (aOR=0.63 [0.61-0.65]). Sex, age, and pandemic-related financial stressors were statistically significant modifiers of the association between social support and depression. Conclusions Individuals reporting higher levels of social support were at reduced risk of depression during the early COVID-19 pandemic. The perceived availability of emotional support and positive social interactions, more so than tangible support, was key. Individuals more vulnerable to depression (e.g., women, younger individuals, and those experiencing financial stressors) may particularly benefit from enhanced social support, supporting a precision prevention approach.","Choi, Karmel, Lee, Younga, Liu, Zhaowen, Fatori, Daniel, Bauermeister, Joshua, Luh, Rebecca, Clark, Cheryl, Brunoni, AndrÃ©, Bauermeister, Sarah, Smoller, Jordan","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.15.22274976","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31937,""

"Sleep quality and patterns of young West Balkan adults during the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","To evaluate the sleep patterns among young West Balkan adults during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire based on established sleep questionnaires Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (February-August 2021). Young adults of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia. Of 1058 subjects, mean age was 28.19Ã‚Â±9.29 years; majority were women (81.4%) and students (61.9%). Compared with before the pandemic, 528 subjects (49.9%) reported a change in sleeping patterns during the pandemic, with 47.3% subjects reporting sleeping less. Mean sleeping duration during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7.71Ã‚Â±2.14Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours with median sleep latency of 20 (10.0-30.0)Ã¢â‚¬â€°min. Only 91 (8.6%) subjects reported consuming sleeping medications. Of all, 574 (54.2%) subjects had ISI score &gt;7, with majority (71.2%) having subthreshold insomnia, and 618 (58.4%) PSQI score Ã¢â€°Â¥5, thus indicating poor sleep quality. Of 656 (62.0%) tested subjects, 464 (43.9%) were COVID-19 positive (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) who were 48.8%, next to women (70%), more likely to have insomnia symptoms; and 66.9% were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Subjects using sleep medication were 44 times, and subjects being positive to ISI 15.36 times more likely to have poor sleep quality. In contrast, being a student was a negative independent predictor for both insomnia symptoms and poor sleep quality, and mental labour and not working were negative independent predictors for insomnia symptoms. During the third wave of the pandemic, sleep patterns were impaired in about half of young West Balkan adults, with COVID-19-positive subjects and being women as positive independent predictors and being a student as negative independent predictor of impaired sleep pattern. Due to its importance in long-term health outcomes, sleep quality in young adults, especially COVID-19-positive ones, should be thoroughly assessed.","Ã…Â ljivo, JuginoviÃ„â€¡, IvanoviÃ„â€¡, Quraishi, MulaÃ„â€¡, KovaÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, IvanoviÃ„â€¡, VukoviÃ„â€¡, Aranza, BiloÃ…Â¡, Ljuhar, DraÃ…Â¡koviÃ„â€¡, Ã„â€ etkoviÃ„â€¡, Abdulkhaliq, DadiÃ„â€¡, BegiÃ„â€¡, MujiÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡, Kulo Ã„â€ esiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060381","20220525","COVID-19; mental health; sleep medicine; substance misuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31939,""

Multivariable linear regression. Mean overall, emotional and social loneliness scores were 2.78 (<i>SD</i> = 1.91), 1.27 (<i>SD =</i> 1.02), and 1.52 (<i>SD =</i> 1.26). Being not married/partnered (ÃŽÂ² = .61) and self-reported depression/anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = .64) were associated with higher overall scores, and selection of videoconference (ÃŽÂ² = -.77) and self-study (ÃŽÂ² =-.85) modes with lower scores. Self-reported depression/anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = .51) was associated with increased emotional loneliness. Being not married/not partnered (ÃŽÂ² = .37) and selection of chronic pain workshops (ÃŽÂ² = .64) was were associated with increased social loneliness. Selection of videoconference (ÃŽÂ² = -.44) and self-study (ÃŽÂ² = -.51) delivery modes were protective of social loneliness. In addition to marital status and depression/anxiety, experiencing chronic pain and selecting phone-based workshops were associated with higher degrees of loneliness among rural adults during the pandemic. The latter may be partly explained by insufficient internet access. Health educators should be prepared to address loneliness in rural areas during the pandemic.","Brunner, Pullyblank, Scribani, Krupa","https://doi.org/10.1177/08901171221105265","20220525","COVID-19; adults; health communications; internet; loneliness; mental health; rural health; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31940,""
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance in an urban Chinese population of Hong Kong: a cross-sectional study","Vaccine hesitancy against COVID-19 is prevalent. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination compliance among adults in Hong Kong. An online survey was conducted during an early stage of community-based COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Hong Kong. The questionnaire consisted of vaccine status, sociodemographic information, risk perception of being infected by COVID-19, and exposure to confirmed COVID cases, as well as items on sleep and mental health. The association between these variables and vaccine hesitancy was analyzed. Among the 883 participants (67.5% females, 54.5% aged 18-39), 30.6% had low vaccine hesitancy, 27.4% had high vaccine hesitancy, and 27.5% had vaccine rejection. The likelihood of having high vaccine hesitancy was higher among young (adjusted odds ratio [<i>aOR</i>]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-7.30) and middle-aged respondents (<i>aOR</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.99; 95% CI: 1.07-5.47) than among old respondents. Moreover, those who were married (<i>aOR</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.51; 95% CI: 0.29-0.88), had a full-time job (<i>aOR</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.55; 95% CI: 0.29-0.88), and had a greater confidence in the government (<i>aOR</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.68; 95% CI: 0.54-0.86) were less likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy. Our findings showed that the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and vaccine resistance were high. Policy makers need specific strategies to target those who may have a high risk of vaccine hesitancy and resistance.","Yu, Lam, Lam, Li, Chen, Lam, Yeung","https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2022.2072144","20220525","Vaccination; herd immunity; observational; pandemic; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31941,""

"Diurnal dynamics of stress and mood during COVID-19 lockdown: a large multinational ecological momentary assessment study","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in severe disruption to people's lives as governments imposed national 'lockdowns'. Several large surveys have underlined the detrimental short- and long-term mental health consequences resulting from this disruption, but survey findings are only informative of individuals' retrospectively reported psychological states. Furthermore, knowledge on psychobiological responses to lockdown restrictions is scarce. We used smartphone-based real-time assessments in 731 participants for 7 days and investigated how individuals' self-reported stress and mood fluctuated diurnally during lockdown in spring 2020. We found that age, gender, financial security, depressive symptoms and trait loneliness modulated the diurnal dynamics of participants' momentary stress and mood. For example, younger and less financially secure individuals showed an attenuated decline in stress as the day progressed, and similarly, more lonely individuals showed a diminished increase in calmness throughout the day. Hair collected from a subsample (<i>n</i> = 140) indicated a decrease in cortisol concentrations following lockdown, but these changes were not related to any of the assessed person-related characteristics. Our findings provide novel insights into the psychobiological impact of lockdown and have implications for how, when and which individuals might benefit most from interventions during psychologically demanding periods.","Feneberg, Forbes, Piperno, Pronizius, Stijovic, Skoluda, Lamm, Nater, Silani","https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2480","20220525","COVID-19; diurnal changes; ecological momentary assessment; hair cortisol; mood; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31943,""

"Characterizing changes in mental health-related outcomes for health service psychology graduate students during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","Health service psychology (HSP) graduate students experienced adverse mental health outcomes during COVID-19. However, little is known about how mental health outcomes changed in this population after the onset of COVID-19. NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°496 HSP graduate students reported onset or worsening of mental health outcomes, inability to access mental health care, worry about COVID-19, and stress at two different timepoints during the first year of the COVID-19 outbreak (timepoint 1: May 1 to June 25, 2020; timepoint 2: September 2 to October 17, 2020). This study tested whether mental health outcomes improved, worsened, or stayed stable during this timeframe. The study also examined whether rising COVID-19 case rates in the state where a participant lived moderated changes in mental health outcomes. Overall, HSP graduate students endorsed adverse mental health outcomes at a higher rate during the first survey relative to the second survey. Even still, 62.68% of students reported worsened mental health symptoms, 49.84% reported worsened sleep, and 23.92% reported increased alcohol and substance use in the 2 months leading up to the second survey. HSP programs should monitor graduate students' evolving mental health, provide wellness resources, and adopt flexible approaches to support graduate students navigating training during periods of immense disruption.","Daniel, Szkody, Aggarwal, Peterman, Washburn, Selby","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23392","20220525","adult mental health; clinical psychology; emotional distress; longitudinal studies; subjective experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31945,""
"Program Impact Pathway of the Positive Deviance/Hearth Interactive Voice Calling Program in a Peri-Urban Context of Cambodia","Positive Deviance/Hearth (PDH) is an internationally recognized nutrition rehabilitation program. However, nutritional improvements are inconsistent across contexts. It is unclear if variations are due to differences in program design, implementation, utilization, or other contextual factors. Furthermore, few PDH programs have addressed the high time and work burdens of caregivers and volunteers. To address this, the study integrated interactive voice calling (IVC) with PDH. A program impact pathway (PIP) analysis was used to evaluate the secondary outcomes of facilitators, barriers, and contextual factors that influenced the design, implementation, and utilization of a Positive Deviance/Hearth-Interactive Voice Calling program to improve the nutritional status of children in Cambodia. A PIP analysis was done on data collected through in-depth interviews with caregivers (<i>nÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 32), key informant interviews with volunteers (<i>nÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 16) and project staff (<i>nÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 3), and surveys of project staff (<i>nÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 5). In the design phase, facilitators included quality training, technical support and design tools, community mobilization, and linkage to existing health services. Barriers included poor community mobilization. For the implementation phase, facilitators were good volunteer knowledge, follow-up tools and guidance, supervision, and spot checks of volunteers. Barriers were lack of time and overworked older caregivers. For the utilization phase, facilitators included family and volunteer support and access to phones, whereas barriers were lack of support, time, and financial resources; low levels of education and old age of caregivers; and inconsistent phone use. Contextual factors included food insecurity and increased childcare responsibilities of grandmothers due to migration of mothers. The PIP analysis identified facilitators, barriers, and contextual factors that may affect the design, intervention, and utilization of IVC interventions for health and nutrition behavior change and elements to consider when designing and implementing them. When implementing child nutrition programs in Cambodia, supporting interventions addressing mental health and time and resource constraints of elderly caregivers should also be included.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03399058.","Baik, Reinsma, Chhorvann, Oy, Heang, Young","https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn/nzac045","20220525","COVID-19 innovation; Cambodia; Positive Deviance Hearth; grandmothers; interactive voice calling; mental health; mobile health; nutrition; qualitative; urban","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31946,""
"The impact of screen time and green time on mental health in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the life of children and adolescents in an unpredecented way. In the present study, we focused on two activities that have been likely affected by mitigation measures: screen time and green time. We investigated how both influenced each during the pandemic, how they affected children's and adolescents' mental health, and which role socio-demographic characteristics have in predicting screen time, green time, and mental health. We used data collected between autumn 2020 and spring 2021 from 844 participants aged 5 to 19 of a population-based, prospective cohort study in [omitted for review]. We analyzed the data using an extended version of the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model with time-invariant socio-demographic covariates and mental health as outcome. Results showed that, at the between-person level, screen time was a risk factor and green time a protective factor of mental health. However, within-person deviations of screen time and green time during the pandemic did not consistently predict mental health. Furthermore, they did not influence each other over time. Gender, age, perceived economic situation of the family, Body Mass Index and the availability of green space nearby all influenced stable measures of green time and screen time (i.e., random intercepts). Our results highlight the need for targeted actions to promote green time and raise awareness about the detrimental effect of screen time on children's and adolescents' mental health.","Camerini, Albanese, Marciano","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbr.2022.100204","20220525","Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Green time; Longitudinal; Mental health; Random intercept cross-lagged panel model; Screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31947,""
"Biochemical Characterization of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 Endoribonuclease Variants","Global sequencing efforts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, continue to provide insight into the evolution of the viral genome. Coronaviruses encode 16 nonstructural proteins, within the first two-thirds of their genome, that facilitate viral replication and transcription as well as evasion of the host immune response. However, many of these viral proteins remain understudied. Nsp15 is a uridine-specific endoribonuclease conserved across all coronaviruses. The nuclease activity of Nsp15 helps the virus evade triggering an innate immune response. Understanding how Nsp15 has changed over the course of the pandemic, and how mutations affect its RNA processing function, will provide insight into the evolution of an oligomerization-dependent endoribonuclease and inform drug design. In combination with previous structural data, bioinformatics analyses of 1.9+ million SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed mutations across Nsp15ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s three structured domains (N-terminal, Middle, EndoU). Selected Nsp15 variants were characterized biochemically and compared to wild type Nsp15. We found that mutations to important catalytic residues decreased cleavage activity but increased the hexamer/monomer ratio of the recombinant protein. Many of the highly prevalent variants we analyzed led to decreased nuclease activity as well as an increase in the inactive, monomeric form. Overall, our work establishes how Nsp15 variants seen in patient samples affect nuclease activity and oligomerization, providing insight into the effect of these variants <i>in vivo</i> .","Wilson, Frazier, Li, Randall, Stanley","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.10.491349","20220525","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31948,""
"Belief in a just world, perceived control, perceived risk, and hopelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a globally diverse sample","The purpose of this study was to understand the complex relationships between belief in a just world (BJW), perceived control, perceived risk to self and others, and hopelessness among a globally diverse sample during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The just-world hypothesis suggests that people need to believe in a just world in which they get what they deserve and deserve what they get. Studies have shown that believing in a just world has an adaptive function for individuals. Samples from six countries completed an online questionnaire. A total of 1,250 people participated (934 female) and ages ranged from 16 to 84Ã‚Â years old (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36.3, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.5). The results showed that, when controlling for gender, age, country of residence, and being in a risk group for COVID-19 (e.g., smoker, old age, chronic disease etc.), a stronger personal and general BJW and higher perceived control over the COVID-19 pandemic predicted lower levels of hopelessness. How at-risk participants perceived themselves to be for COVID-19 positively predicted hopelessness, but how risky participants perceived the disease to be for others negatively predicted hopelessness.

"Differences in college students' occupational dysfunction and mental health considering trait and state anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, university education has shifted from face-to-face classes to online and distance learning. Effects of exposure may manifest in terms of psychological, cognitive, or musculoskeletal impairments that affect an individual's daily functioning and quality of life. There is a dearth of studies exploring anxiety states, occupational dysfunction, and mental health associated with the new standard of increased telecommunication. Accordingly, the present study aimed to identify the differences in occupational dysfunction, health literacy, positive and negative emotions, and stress response considering the anxiety states of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another purpose is to identify relationships among the parameters such as occupational dysfunction and mental health. This cross-sectional study included 358 students (average age: 18.5 years, age range: 18-29 years). Five tools were used: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Classification and Assessment of Occupational Dysfunction (CAOD), European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q47), Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS-2), and Stress Response Scale-18 (SRS-18). Based on the cutoff value of state and trait anxiety of the STAI, the participants were classified into four groups and compared using one-way analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests. The relationship between all parameters was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The group with high trait anxiety and high state anxiety had the highest CAOD total score, Total Mood Disturbance score on the POMS-2, SRS-18 score, and scores on many sub-items of the three parameters. The prevalence of occupational dysfunction was 47% for university students, and there was a variation of from 19 to 61% in each group. The correlation coefficients of the state and trait anxiety scores of the STAI, Total Mood Disturbance score, and SRS-18 ranged from .64 to .75. Additionally, the correlation coefficient between the CAOD total score and these parameters ranged from .44 to .48. The prevalence of occupational dysfunction was highest in the group with high trait anxiety and high state anxiety, and occupational dysfunction, negative emotions, and stress responses were strongest in this group. Our findings point to potential areas for targeted support and interventions.","Kusumoto, Higo, Ohno","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13443","20220525","COVID-19; Classification and assessment of occupational dysfunction; College student; European health literacy survey questionnaire; Occupational dysfunction; Profile of mood states 2nd edition; State anxiety; State-trait anxiety inventory; Stress Response Scale-18; Trait anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31951,""
"Big data analytics on social networks for real-time depression detection","During the coronavirus pandemic, the number of depression cases has dramatically increased. Several depression sufferers disclose their actual feeling via social media. Thus, big data analytics on social networks for real-time depression detection is proposed. This research work detected the depression by analyzing both demographic characteristics and opinions of Twitter users during a two-month period after having answered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 used as an outcome measure. Machine learning techniques were applied as the detection model construction. There are five machine learning techniques explored in this research which are Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, and Deep Learning. The experimental results revealed that the Random Forest technique achieved higher accuracy than other techniques to detect the depression. This research contributes to the literature by introducing a novel model based on analyzing demographic characteristics and text sentiment of Twitter users. The model can capture depressive moods of depression sufferers. Thus, this work is a step towards reducing depression-induced suicide rates.","Angskun, Tipprasert, Angskun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-022-00622-2","20220525","Big data analytics; Depression detection; Social networks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31952,""
"The experiences of patients with diabetes and strategies for their management during the first COVID-19 lockdown: a qualitative study","During the pandemic, primary care systems prioritised attention to COVID-19 patients; chronically ill patients, such as people with Type 2 Diabetes were obliged to take more responsibility for their own care. We aimed to analyse the experiences of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus during the stay-at-home order that was in place during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and identify the strategies and resources used in managing their care. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study. The participants were ten patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who experienced strict lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia, Spain, selected using intentional sampling. We recorded semi-structured interviews with the participants and conducted thematic analysis. We identified 14 subthemes, which we then grouped into three overarching themes: 1) anxiety, fear, and vulnerability (anxiety, fear, vulnerability, rethinking life, loneliness, sadness), 2) insufficient diabetes monitoring by the health system (health care received, glycaemic control, view of treatment by health providers) and proactive self-care (changes in daily routine, diet, physical activity, medication, personal protective equipment &amp; social distancing). Despite the exceptional nature of the situation and the stress, worry, and changes in their daily lives, many respondents reported that they had successfully modified their lifestyles. Self-care was effective during confinement and was based on a process of adaptation using the resources available, without face-to-face contact with primary care health staff. These results can help to guide the design and implementation of self-care-focused strategies and also to explore new ways of empowering patients without access to health care personnel.","Vilafranca Cartagena, Tort-Nasarre, Romeu-Labayen, Vidal-Alaball","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-00911-4","20220524","COVID-19; Nurses; Patient isolation; Primary health care; Qualitative Research; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31953,""
"Teachers' Response to Stress, Anxiety and Depression During COVID-19 Lockdown: What Have We Learned From the Pandemic?","As a result of national lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, teachers were forced to suspend their classes and replace them with online teaching and home schooling. Additional stressors such as competing family responsibility have increased their worries and mental health problems. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19-related worries on teachers' emotional symptoms, considering the mediating role of several protective factors. A total of 614 Chilean teachers (94.60% women) participated in this study using a cross-sectional design and incidental sampling method. Self-report data was collected assessing emotional symptoms, COVID-19-related worries, life satisfaction, affect balance, and resilience. Descriptive analyses, Pearson's correlations, hierarchical regressions, and mediation models were conducted. The results indicated that emotional symptoms were associated with prepandemic physical and mental health problems, higher levels of worries and negative affect, as well as lower levels of life satisfaction and resilience. Results from the mediation models showed that the negative impact of COVID-19-related worries on emotional symptoms was alleviated by affect balance and resilience. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the risk and protective factors for teachers' mental health during exceptional situations such as the ongoing pandemic.","Lacomba-Trejo, Schoeps, Valero-Moreno, Del Rosario, Montoya-Castilla","https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13192","20220524","Chile; affect balance; mental health; pandemic; resilience; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-26","",31954,""
