"Digital Interventions for Psychological Comorbidities in Chronic Diseases-A Systematic Review","Chronic diseases represent one of the main causes of death worldwide. The integration of digital solutions in clinical interventions is broadly diffused today; however, evidence on their efficacy in addressing psychological comorbidities of chronic diseases is sparse. This systematic review analyzes and synthesizes the evidence about the efficacy of digital interventions on psychological comorbidities outcomes of specific chronic diseases. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search of PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted. Only Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were considered and either depression or anxiety had to be assessed to match the selection criteria. Of the 7636 identified records, 17 matched the inclusion criteria: 9 digital interventions on diabetes, 4 on cardiovascular diseases, 3 on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and one on stroke. Of the 17 studies reviewed, 14 found digital interventions to be effective. Quantitative synthesis highlighted a moderate and significant overall effect of interventions on depression, while the effect on anxiety was small and non-significant. Design elements making digital interventions effective for psychological comorbidities of chronic diseases were singled out: (a) implementing a communication loop with patients and (b) providing disease-specific digital contents. This focus on ""how"" to design technologies can facilitate the translation of evidence into practice.","Maisto, Marta; Diana, Barbara; Di Tella, Sonia; Matamala-Gomez, Marta; Montana, Jessica Isbely; Rossetto, Federica; Mavrodiev, Petar Aleksandrov; Cavalera, Cesare; Blasi, Valeria; Mantovani, Fabrizia; Baglio, Francesca; Realdon, Olivia","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jpm11010030","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pers Med;11(1)2021 Jan 06.; Publication details: J Pers Med;11(1)2021 Jan 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9375,""
"Parent Feeding Practices in the Context of Food Insecurity","The process of feeding is complex and highly dependent on parent, child, social, and environmental factors. Given the rising rates of food insecurity and concomitant poor nutrition and health, the purpose of this article was to outline the important and complex ways in which the context of food insecurity can impact parent feeding practices. Key factors discussed here include the impact of food insecurity on: expectations for motherhood, structural constraints, stress and depression, parents' perceptions of health and child weight, and intergenerational transmission of parent feeding practices. Future research needs are also identified and discussed.","Arlinghaus, Katherine R; Laska, Melissa N","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020366","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(2)2021 Jan 06.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(2)2021 Jan 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9376,""
"Social isolation stress facilitates chemically induced oral carcinogenesis","Social isolation has affected a large number of people and may lead to impairment of physical and mental health. Although stress resulting from social isolation may increase cancer progression, its interference on tumorigenesis is poorly known. In this study, we used a preclinical model to evaluate the effects of social isolation stress on chemically induced oral carcinogenesis. Sixty-two 21-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into isolated and grouped groups. After 90 days of age, the rats from both groups underwent oral carcinogenesis with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) for 20 weeks. All rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior and euthanized for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) diagnosis and measurement of inflammatory mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Social isolation stress increased the OSCC occurrence by 20.4% when compared to control. Isolated rats also showed higher tumor volume and cachexia than the grouped rats. Social isolation did not induce changes in the depressive-like behavior after carcinogenic induction. Tumors from stressed rats had increased levels of the inflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, IL1-beta and MCP-1. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were significantly increased in the large tumors from isolated animals. Higher tumor levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL1-beta and MCP-1 were positively correlated with OSCC growth. This study provides the first evidence that social isolation stress may facilitate OSCC occurrence and tumor progression, an event accompanied by increased local levels of inflammatory mediators.","Verza, FlÃ¡via Alves; Valente, Vitor Bonetti; Oliveira, Lia Kobayashi; Kayahara, Giseli Mitsuy; Crivelini, Marcelo Macedo; Furuse, Cristiane; Biasoli, Ã‰der Ricardo; Miyahara, Glauco Issamu; Oliveira, Sandra Helena Penha; BernabÃ©, Daniel Galera","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245190","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(1): e0245190, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(1): e0245190, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9377,""

"An Online Questionnaire Survey on the Sexual Life and Sexual Function of Chinese Adult Men During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic","INTRODUCTION: There has been no report regarding the impact on male sexual life or sexual function by changes in lifestyle during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. AIM: To investigate the changes in sexual life and sexual function of Chinese men during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was created and the survey was administered through social media to Chinese adult men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main end point was the deteriorated erectile function or ejaculatory control ability, defined by self-evaluation or by decreased International Index of Erectile Function-5 items (IIEF-5) scores or increased premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) scores. RESULTS: Altogether, 612 questionnaires were collected. About 322 (52.6%) subjects were unmarried. About 8.4% and 8.5% subjects reported deteriorated erectile function or ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation, whereas 31.9% and 17.9% subjects showed decreased IIEF-5 scores or increased PEDT scores. Subjects with deteriorated erectile function by self-evaluation and decreased IIEF-5 scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P = .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic, decreased frequency of sexual life (P < .001 and P < .001) and physical exercise (P = .009 and .007) after the epidemic. Subjects with deteriorated ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation and increased PEDT scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P < .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic. Subjects with decreased frequency of sexual life had reduced income (P < .001), increased anxiety (P < .001) and depression (P < .001). Married subjects had higher proportion of improved depression (P = .048) and increased frequency of sexual life (P = .010). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased sexual function was present in a certain proportion of adult men, and the risk factors include increased anxiety and depression, and decreased frequency of sexual life.

"Supporting Children With Speech Sound Disorders During COVID-19 Restrictions: Technological Solutions","Purpose: ""Children are the hidden victims of the COVID-19 pandemic"" (United Nations Children's Fund, 2020)  Timely and effective speech intervention is important to reduce the impact on children's school achievement, ability to make friends, mental health, future life opportunities, and government resources  Prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many Australian children did not receive sufficient speech-language pathology (SLP) services due to long waiting lists in the public health system  COVID-19 restrictions exacerbated this issue, as even children who were at the top of lengthy SLP waiting lists often received limited services, particularly in rural areas  To facilitate children receiving speech intervention remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding three technological solutions are examined: (a) Phoneme Factory Sound Sorter (Sound Start Study), (b) Waiting for Speech Pathology website, and (c) Apraxia World  Conclusions: For the first two technological solutions, there were similar gains in speech production between the intervention and control groups, whereas, for the third solution, the average magnitude of treatment effect was comparable to face-to-face SLP therapy  Automated therapy management systems may be able to accelerate speech development and support communication resilience to counteract the effects of the COVID-19 restrictions on children with speech sound disorders  Technology-based strategies may also provide a potential solution to the chronic shortage of SLP services in rural areas into the future","McLeod, Sharynne, Ballard, Kirrie J.; Ahmed, Beena, McGill, Nicole, Brown, Michelle I.","https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_PERSP-20-00128","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups;5(6):1805-1808, 2020.; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups;5(6):1805-1808, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9391,""

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm episodes in the UK: a population-based cohort study","Summary Background The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected population mental health  We aimed to assess temporal trends in primary care-recorded common mental illness, episodes of self-harm, psychotropic medication prescribing, and general practitioner (GP) referrals to mental health services during the COVID-19 emergency in the UK  Methods We did a population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from general practices registered on the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)  We included patient records from Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 10, 2020, to establish long-term trends and patterns of seasonality, but focused primarily on the period January, 2019â€“September, 2020  We extracted data on clinical codes entered into patient records to estimate the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders, self-harm, prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and GP referrals to mental health services, and assessed event rates of all psychotropic prescriptions and self-harm  We used mean-dispersion negative binomial regression models to predict expected monthly incidence and overall event rates, which were then compared with observed rates to assess the percentage reduction in incidence and event rates after March, 2020  We also stratified analyses by sex, age group, and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles  Findings We identified 14 210 507 patients from 1697 UK general practices registered in the CPRD databases  In April, 2020, compared with expected rates, the incidence of primary care-recorded depression had reduced by 43Â·0% (95% CI 38Â·3â€“47Â·4), anxiety disorders by 47Â·8% (44Â·3â€“51Â·2), and first antidepressant prescribing by 36Â·4% (33Â·9â€“38Â·8) in English general practices  Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were largest for adults of working age (18â€“44 and 45â€“64 years) and for patients registered at practices in more deprived areas  The incidence of self-harm was 37Â·6% (34Â·8â€“40Â·3%) lower than expected in April, 2020, and the reduction was greatest for women and individuals aged younger than 45 years  By September, 2020, rates of incident depression, anxiety disorder, and self-harm were similar to expected levels  In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, rates of incident depression and anxiety disorder remained around a third lower than expected to September, 2020  In April, 2020, the rate of referral to mental health services was less than a quarter of the expected rate for the time of year (75Â·3% reduction [74Â·0â€“76Â·4])  Interpretation Consequences of the considerable reductions in primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm could include more patients subsequently presenting with greater severity of mental illness and increasing incidence of non-fatal self-harm and suicide  Addressing the effects of future lockdowns and longer-term impacts of economic instability on mental health should be prioritised  Funding National Institute for Health Research and Medical Research Council","Carr, Matthew J.; Steeg, Sarah, Webb, Roger T.; Kapur, Nav, Chew-Graham, Carolyn A.; Abel, Kathryn M.; Hope, Holly, Pierce, Matthias, Ashcroft, Darren M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30288-7","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Lancet Public Health;2021.; Publication details: The Lancet Public Health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9393,""

"Pushing LIMITS: Envisioning beyond the artifact","As a pandemic rages and ecosystems around the globe collapse, the LIMITS community-along with the rest of the world-is working to adapt  Some adaptations to adjust to emergencies are easy to imagine  For example, months before in-person conferences were canceled in response to COVID-19, the User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) 2019 conference took significant steps towards hosting a geographically distributed, virtual conference, in part adapting to the global climate emergency  This type of change is conceptually clear, if organizationally challenging  However, many needed changes are conceptually difficult, even in the midst of an existential crisis  It is long-recognized that we need to bridge the separation between scholarly venues and publications that focus on technical aspects of computing systems (i e , ""applied"") and those that center social and political aspects of computing systems research and design, particularly when attempting to address complex life-wide problems  Yet, disciplinary crystals (e g , siloes) remain resistant to change  The authors of this paper contribute to ongoing socio-technical efforts, identifying dominant practices and forces that reinforce the socio-technical divide, and holding up empirical projects that offer promising alternatives  We resist the dominant norm to claim that our contributions to scholarship are original, cutting-edge, or unique  Rather this paper revisits a research paradigm from the past because it remains useful and generative for the computing research communities of the future  Through our inquiry we identify a long-standing tendency to include a pivot-a distinct turn to privilege the design of new digital artifacts-even in papers advocating for more expansive conceptualizations of interactive systems  While acknowledging the importance of the initial design of material artifacts (and their associated infrastructures), we reject the assumption that the ultimate ""good""of computing or interactive design research is creating new digital artifacts/tools for the marketplace  We offer four provocations to help us understand why material-based, industry-oriented narratives dominate applied venues of computing  Empirical examples from projects around the world, including work that extends the relational and temporal boundaries of computing design, offer alternative approaches  Fundamentally, we ask readers to consider the type of research that the LIMITS community values and in what ways is this scholarship of value to a world in crisis  How does LIMITs research matter?

"Anxiety-related psychological impacts in the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular diseases and diabetes","Patients and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia, causing, consequently, the impaired quality of life  Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of health-related quality of life and disease control  A novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), a pathogen of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has affected several sector activities, including people&#039;s health  To enhance infection control methods, appropriate interventions, and public health policies, the present study aims to assess the fear and peri-traumatic stress during the Covid-19 in Brazil  Method: A cross-sectional survey has been conducted from April 12th to 18th using the Peri-Traumatic Distress Scale (CPDI) and the Fear Scale (FCV-19S) aiming to measure the peri-traumatic stress and fear as psychological reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic  For that purpose, an online spreadsheet was used to send the questionnaire and scales to a sample of 1844 participants as a collecting information tool  After the data analysis, the individuals were separated into 4 groups: Group 1 (1232) population without chronic health conditions;group 2 (298) patients with previous psychological suffering, group 3 (229) patients with cardiovascular diseases, group 4 (71) patients with diabetes  For analysis, G1 and were considered control for comparison with groups 2, 3 and 4 in accordance with One-Way Anova followed by Bonferroni test  Results: All the groups showed the CPDI and FCV-19S increased in comparison with the G1 group  Concerning CPDI, the G 3 was increased when compared to G1, G2 and G4  The G3 had the FCV-19S higher in comparison with G1, G2 and G4  The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test showed a statistical difference between the control group in comparison with 2 and 3 groups (Mann-Whitney p&amp;lt;0 05)  Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Brazilian population, with patients with heart disease and hypertension presenting the highest numbers of stress and fear, with numbers comparable and even higher than those who reported previous psychological distress","Teixeira, Lucas, Freitas, Renato Leonardo de, Abad, Alberto, Silva, Juliana Almeida da, Antonelli-Ponti, Mayra, Bastos, Sandra, MÃ¡rmora, ClÃ¡udia Helena Cerqueira, Campos, Luis Antonio Monteiro, Paiva, Scheila, Silva, JosÃ© Aparecido da","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety-related+psychological+impacts+in+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+cardiovascular+diseases+and+diabetes","","Database: PREPRINT-SCIELO; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9431,""

"COVID-21","This electronic monograph is divided into fifteen chapters  The objective of this electronic monograph is to show the impact of pandemics on the economic performance of any country anytime and anywhere  This first chapter explains each chapter of this electronic monograph  The second chapter analyses the impact of Globalization as in the main reason of the fast spread of COVID-2019 worldwide  We divided into three large sections how Globalization is the main reason of the faster COVID-19 spread worldwide followed by: (a ) the institutional, legal, and political approach of Globalization;(b ) the massive transportations systems and the development of information communication technologies (ICTâ€™s);(c ) the free trade liberalization and labor mobility  Hence, the main objective of this research is to show that Globalization is the major responsible of the fast and unstoppable spread of COVID-2019 globally  Finally, the same research suggests a deep reform of Globalization to avoid again any massive contagious epidemic diseases to reduce its impact economically and socially  The third chapter tries to expose how poverty can be a crucial issue in the faster expansion of COVID-19 in developing countries like Guatemala  This research chapter's primary objective is to prove that the rapid development of COVID-19 infected cases is directly involved in the massive poverty levels in developing countries  However, this chapter also looks at the dramatic reduction of the middle class and the expansion of poverty  This research focuses on how developing, and least developed countries are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), how developing countries such as Guatemala got exponential COVID-19 contagious cases growth rates of 300% daily  According to our preliminary results in the case of Guatemala, we can observe that poverty originated from enormous inflation, massive unemployment, deep-rooted discrimination -by race and economic-, income inequality -the largest in Latin America-, a large informal economy â€“urban and rural-, and a vast corruption -myopic governments with personal agendas-  Finally, this chapter tries to present policies (Ruiz Estrada, 2011) and (Ruiz Estrada and Park, 2018) to the Guatemalan government, the private sector, and civil society from a holistic approach to Guatemala conditions and characteristics  In the fourth chapter, we evaluate visually how the COVID-19 quarantines can generate massive unemployment, the constant expansion of inflation, the reduction of the purchasing power parity, and the poverty expansion from a multidimensional perspective  This visualization is only possible under the creation of a new multidimensional graphical modeling is called â€œThe Multidimensional Poverty Kaleidoscope Graph â€ The multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph is not intended to use a forecasting model in any case  However, its application is not limited to the study of a select group of countries  It is not constrained by issues about the region or countries interested in applying the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph  There are four primary phases in the implementation of the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph  The first phase is the design of the input-output-table  The second phase is divided into two sections of analysis: the first section of study assumes that the COVID-19 quarantine time framework growth rate (Y = Independent variable) impact directly on our four variables in the report such as the inflation growth rate (X1), the unemployment growth rate (X2), purchasing power parity growth rate (X3) and the government budget deficit (X4)  In the second section of the analysis, the last past four variables in analysis became our dependent variables and directly affected the poverty growth rate (Z)  The third phase is the construction of the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph  Finally, the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph was applied to three countries: The U S , Malaysia, and Guatemala  The chapter fifth exposes a new view of COVID-19 in general  We are interested in going more rooted in the transformation from COVID-19 to COVID-20  This research aims to prove that COVID-19 can transform anytime and anywhere quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively  This research believes that COVID-19 is transforming and generating a new mutation that can change in a new virus  This new virus will be entitled â€œCOVID-20 â€ The COVID-20 is going to be more potent and complex than COVID-19, according to our observations  We are considering that COVID-20 started massively from January 2020 until the end of December 2020, according to this research  This transformation is not only in symptoms and characteristics but also in its way of transmission, controls, treatments, and eradication  The sixth chapter tries to compare the characteristics of the animal viral strain (e g , avian influenza and rabies) and the new viral strain called the COVID-19  The main idea is to evaluate a serial of parameters such as the composition, behavior, structure, environments, reproduction, mutation periods, and the reaction together of different viral strains under the use of an extensive database according to twenty-six variables with his twenty-six large databases respectively  This research aims to plot the twenty-six databases in the viral strain coordinate space (VS-Coordinate Space) to generate different viral strain surfaces (VS-Surfaces)  Therefore, we will build three different VS-Surfaces with similar sizes and colors to identify different viral strains' characteristics and behavior simultaneously  Hence, we can compare the COVID-19 viral strain surface with each animal viral strain surface, such as avian influenza and rabies  If the COVID-19 viral strain surface cannot show similitudes with the other VS-surfaces from the animal viral strain surfaces (avian influenza and rabies), we can confirm that the new COVID-19 viral strain surface has a possible human intervention, manipulation, and reproduction  Finally, we can generate a list of possible origins of the latest COVID-19 viral strain surface according to missing characteristics and behavior from the animal viral strains surfaces as soon as possible  It is to control this worldwide pandemic urgently  The chapter seventh intends to evaluate how long any country it takes for its economic recovery from the Post-COVID-19 period under the application of a new indicator called ""COVID-19 Waves Oscillations "" The main objective is to evaluate the world economy economic recovery time framework from COVID-19, respectively  The calculation of COVID-19 Waves Oscillation requests a holistic mathematical approach under the creation of a simple formula  This formula uses the interval of COVID-19 cases daily to elaborate a series of waves from Nano-Waves until Mega-Waves  At the same time, we will demonstrate how the COVID-19 waves oscillation can significantly impact COVID-19 openness behavior (full business and financial activities reactivation â€“commonly)  Finally, we can elaborate on a large number of simulations to evaluate how long it can take different countries to full economic recovery from COVID-19  According to chapter eighth evaluates the big socio-economic dilemma of COVID-19, such as whether we stay at home in quarantine or work as usual  We try to assess quarantines' pros and cons or work in pandemic times from a multidimensional perspective  This research chapter's primary objective is to prove the final impact in both scenarios and the ultimate effect on any country's socio-economic performance  However, this chapter also looks at the negative implications of quarantine (s) on different social groups from low-income people (informal labor sector) to high-income people (formal labor sector)  This research focuses on how quarantine or without quarantine is not the most significant public health policy to solve COVID-19 in the medium and long run  Simultaneously, we did many simulations to evaluate the negative impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic performance in households and firms  Additionally, we propose a new socio-economic simulator to assess the decision to implement full quarantine or without quarantine and its negative impact in the short run  The new simulator is entitled ""The Virtual Socio-Economic Evaluation of Decisions and Scenarios Disk Synchronization for Pandemics Simulator (VSEDSDSP-Simulator) "" According to the VSEDSDSP-Simulator results from different simulations, we can observe that extremes such as a full quarantine or without quarantine can generate an immediately deadly effect in the socio-economic performance in the short and long run without prejudice or preference among different social groups  Hence, this chapter supports an alternative statement is that COVID-19 is not only a simple physical disease;also, COVID-19 is a psychological disease (depression, anxiety, and nostology) that also can directly affect producers' and consumers' productivity and behavior (decisions) considerably","Ruiz Estrada, Mario Arturo","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-21","","Database: SSRN; Publication type:

"[Impact of social distancing on reports of violence against children and adolescents in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil]","This study aimed to analyze the rates of reports of violence against children and adolescents in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, from 2015 to 2020, and the changes in trends by period due to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). This is an ecological time series study with secondary data obtained from the Bi SaÃƒÂºde Portal in the panel on Interpersonal Violence and Suicide. The study collected reports on violence in individuals 0 to 19 years of age in the months of March and April each year, stratified by sex, age bracket, race/color, and type of violence. Prais-Winsten regression was used to analyze the time trend. Of the 7,718 reports analyzed, there was a drop of 54% in the year 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The analysis of the trend until 2019 indicated an increase in the reporting rates (2.04, 95%CI: 1.01; 3.07, p = 0.002), but with the inclusion of the year 2020 in the time series, the direction of the trends in reporting rates was reversed to negative, losing statistical significance (-0.39, 95%CI: -1.16; 2.14, p = 0.632). The study concludes that social distancing due to the pandemic reduced the reporting rates of violence against children and adolescents due to underreporting, thus requiring strategies to improve the identification of suspected cases of violence during the pandemic. This highlights the need for inter-sector planning and rapid and specific actions (health, social protection, justice, and public security) in order to guarantee the rights of children and adolescents.

Das 7.718 notificaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes analisadas, observou-se uma queda de 54% no ano de 2020 comparado com o mesmo perÃƒÂ­odo em 2019. A anÃƒÂ¡lise de tendÃƒÂªncia atÃƒÂ© 2019 indicou aumento nas taxas de notificaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes (2,04, IC95%: 1,01; 3,07, p = 0,002), porÃƒÂ©m, com a inclusÃƒÂ£o do ano de 2020 Ãƒ sÃƒÂ©rie temporal, o direcionamento na tendÃƒÂªncia das taxas de notificaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes inverteu-se para negativo, perdendo a significÃƒÂ¢ncia estatÃƒÂ­stica (-0,39, IC95%: -1,16; 2,14, p = 0,632). Conclui-se que o distanciamento social devido Ãƒ pandemia reduziu as taxas de notificaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes de violÃƒÂªncia contra crianÃƒÂ§as e adolescentes devido Ãƒ subnotificaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o, exigindo estratÃƒÂ©gias que melhorem a identificaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o dos casos suspeitos de violÃƒÂªncia durante a pandemia.

"Western Dietary Pattern Antioxidant Intakes and Oxidative Stress: Importance During the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Pandemic","The importance of balanced dietary habits, which include appropriate amounts of antioxidants to maintain the immune system, has become increasingly relevant during the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, because viral infections are characterized by high oxidative stress. Furthermore, the measures taken by governments to control the pandemic have led to increased anxiety, stress, and depression, which affect physical and mental health, all of which are influenced by nutritional status, diet, and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet (MD), Atlantic diet (AD), and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans all provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds needed to activate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant responses. However, viral pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis entail high oxidative damage caused by both the infection and the resultant social stresses within populations, which increases the probability and severity of infection. Balanced dietary patterns such as the MD and the AD are characterized by the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and whole grains with low intakes of processed foods and red meat. For a healthy lifestyle in young adults, the MD in particular provides the required amount of antioxidants per day for vitamins D (0.3-3.8Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g), E (17.0Ã‚Â mg), C (137.2-269.8Ã‚Â mg), A (1273.3Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g), B-12 (1.5-2.0Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g), and folate (455.1-561.3Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g), the minerals Se (120.0Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g), Zn (11.0Ã‚Â mg), Fe (15.0-18.8Ã‚Â mg), and Mn (5.2-12.5Ã‚Â mg), and polyphenols (1171.00Ã‚Â mg) needed to maintain an active immune response. However, all of these diets are deficient in the recommended amount of vitamin D (20Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g/d). Therefore, vulnerable populations such as elders and obese individuals could benefit from antioxidant supplementation to improve their antioxidant response. Although evidence remains scarce, there is some indication that a healthy diet, along with supplemental antioxidant intake, is beneficial to COVID-19 patients.","Trujillo-Mayol, Guerra-Valle, Casas-Forero, Sobral, Viegas, AlarcÃƒÂ³n-Enos, Ferreira, Pinho","https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmaa171","20210113","Atlantic diet; COVID-19; Mediterranean diet; antioxidants; balanced diet; viral infections","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9453,""

"Geographic Distribution of Mental Health Problems Among Chinese College Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional, Online Survey Study","Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), college students' mental health problems had drawn attention. We aim to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students in different geographical areas in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted in 16 provinces or municipalities among Chinese college students from Feb 4 to Feb 12, 2020. An online survey was adopted to collect information, including demographics, perceived risk of infection, attitudes toward epidemic and control, and mental health status. Anxiety symptom was assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7); depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). A total of 11 787 participants were involved in the current study. The Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage of the perceived risk of infection and attitude toward the COVID-19 between different geographic locations. The binary logistic models were used to identify associations between associations of geographic location and mental health problems after controlling for covariates. A total of 11 787 participants were analyzed in the current study (response rate: 79.7%). The prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms were 17.8% (95%CI: 17.1%-18.5%) and 25.9% (95%CI: 25.1%-26.7%) for college students. After controlling for covariates, geographically speaking, current living in Wuhan was positively associated with anxiety symptoms (current living OR=1.69, 95%CI: 1.23-2.31, and depressive symptoms (current living OR=1.45, 95%CI: 1.21-1.89) compared with other areas. However, there is no difference in college location. Living or travel history in Wuhan last month was also positively associated with anxiety symptoms (OR=1.79, 95%CI: 1.51-2.31) and depressive symptoms (OR=1.62, 95%CI: 1.41-1.85). Both anxiety and depression were more prevalent among college students who reported with high perceived the infection risk of him/herself (Ãâ€¡2= 220.46 for anxiety, Ãâ€¡2=131.79 for depression; both P &lt; .001) and family members (Ãâ€¡2=197.52 for anxiety, Ãâ€¡2=136.06 for depression; both P &lt; .001). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were highest in college students who reported with very worry about the infection of her/himself (Ãâ€¡2=285.77 for anxiety, Ãâ€¡2=186.10 for depression; both P &lt; .001), and community members(Ãâ€¡2=178.46 for anxiety, Ãâ€¡2=119.60 for depression; both P &lt; .001). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were highest in college students who had a pessimistic attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic (Ãâ€¡2=444.61 for anxiety, Ãâ€¡2=355.95 for depression; both P&lt;.001) and control (Ãâ€¡2=154.02 for anxiety, Ãâ€¡2=124.84 for depression; both P&lt; .001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems among Chinese college students were widespread and geographically diverse. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.","Wu, Tao, Zhang, Li, Ma, Yu, Sun, Li, Tao","https://doi.org/10.2196/23126","20210113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9455,""
"Introduction to Special Issue: Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on LGBTQ+ Health and Well-Being","This special issue on the impacts of COVID-19 on LGBTQ+ health and well-being reports findings from nine articles with varied study designs, including data from multiple countries and all segments of LGBTQ+ communities. Key findings included the observation that pre-COVID mental health disparities predispose LGBTQ+ people to poorer outcomes; that technological communication aids are essential in maintaining some sense of community; and that substance use is perceived by sexual minority women as a means of coping with fears, stress, loneliness, and boredom. Studies in this special issue also document that community support is still a critical need, particularly among those who are sheltering at home with families of origin. Findings underscore the importance of addressing structural inequities, including advocating for rights; providing financial support for LGBTQ+ community organizations and networks; ensuring access to competent and affirming healthcare; and including vulnerable communities in disaster response and planning.","Drabble, Eliason","https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2020.1868182","20210113","COVID-19 and LGBTQ+; gender minority; gender nonbinary; health disparities; sexual minority; transgender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9456,""

"The effects of COVID-19 on pediatric anesthesiologists: A survey of the members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of all healthcare workers. Anesthesiologists frequently perform virus-aerosolizing procedures, such as intubation and extubation, that place them at increased risk of infection. We sought to determine how the initial COVID-19 outbreak affected members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) on both personal and professional levels. Specifically, we examined the potential effects of gender and age on personal stress, burnout, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression, assessed job satisfaction, and explored financial impact. After receiving approval from the SPA Committees for Research and Quality and Safety, and the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, we emailed a questionnaire to all 3,245 SPA members. The survey included 22 questions related to well-being and 13 questions related to effects of COVID-19 on current and future practice, finances, retirement planning, academic time and productivity, and clinical and home responsibilities. To address low initial response rates and quantify nonresponse bias, we sent a shortened follow-up survey to a randomly selected subsample (n=100) of SPA members who did not respond to the initial survey. Response differences between the two cohorts were determined. A total of 561 (17%) members responded to the initial questionnaire. Because of COVID-19, 21.7% of respondents said they would change their clinical responsibilities and 10.6% would decrease their professional working time. Women were more likely than men to anticipate a future COVID-19-related job change (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.63, P = 0.011), perhaps because of increased home responsibilities (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.74 to 4.00, P &lt;0.001). Additionally, 14.2% of respondents planned to retire early and 11.9% planned to retire later. Women and non-whites had higher likelihoods of burnout on univariate analysis (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.94, P = 0.026 and OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.08 to 3.04, P = 0.017, respectively) and 25.1% of all respondents felt socially isolated. In addition, both changes in retirement planning and future occupational planning were strongly associated with total job satisfaction scores (both P&lt;0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of pediatric anesthesiologists, albeit not equally, as women and non-whites have been disproportionately impacted. The pandemic has significantly affected personal finances, home responsibilities, and retirement planning, reduced clinical and academic practice time and responsibilities, and increased feelings of social isolation, stress, burnout, and depression/anxiety.","Margolis, Strupp, Beacham, Yaster, Austin, Macrae, Diaz-Berenstain, Janosy","https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000005422","20210113","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9458,""
"Effects of Web-Based Social Connectedness on Older Adults' Depressive Symptoms: A Two-Wave Cross-Lagged Panel Study","Depressive symptoms are the most prevalent mental health concern among older adults (possibly heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic), which raises questions about how such symptoms can be lowered in this population. Existing research shows that offline social connectedness is a protective factor against depression in older adults; however, it is unknown whether web-based social connectedness can have similar effects. This study investigates whether social connectedness on a support website protects older adults against depressive symptoms over the course of a year, above and beyond the protective effect of offline social connectedness. The secondary aim is to determine whether older adults with increased depressive symptoms are more likely to engage in social connectedness on this website. Thus, we examine depressive symptoms as both an outcome and predictor of web-based social connectedness to fully understand the chain of causality among these variables. Finally, we compare web-based social connectedness with offline social connectedness in their ability to lower depressive symptoms among older adults. A total of 197 adults aged 65 years or older were given access to a social support website, where they were able to communicate with each other via a discussion forum for a year. Participants' social connectedness on the web-based platform, conceptualized as message production and consumption, was measured using behavioral log data as the number of messages participants wrote and read, respectively, during the first 6 months (t<sub>1</sub>) and the following 6 months (t<sub>2</sub>) of the study. Participants self-reported their offline social connectedness as the number of people in their support networks, and they reported their depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 both at baseline (t<sub>1</sub>) and at 12-month follow-up (t<sub>2</sub>). To ascertain the flow of causality between these variables, we employed a cross-lagged panel design, in which all variables were measured at t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub>. After controlling for the effect of offline support networks at t<sub>1</sub>, web-based message consumption at t<sub>1</sub> decreased older adults' depressive symptoms at t<sub>2</sub> (ÃŽÂ²=-.11; P=.02), but web-based message production at t<sub>1</sub> did not impact t<sub>2</sub> depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²=.12; P=.34). Web-based message consumption had a larger effect (ÃŽÂ²=-.11; P=.02) than offline support networks (ÃŽÂ²=-.08; P=.03) in reducing older adults' depressive symptoms over time. Higher baseline depressive symptoms did not predict increased web-based message consumption (ÃŽÂ²=.12; P=.36) or production (ÃŽÂ²=.02; P=.43) over time. The more messages older adults read on the web-based forum for the first 6 months of the study, the less depressed they felt at the 1-year follow-up, above and beyond the availability of offline support networks at baseline. This pinpoints the substantial potential of web-based communication to combat depressive symptoms in this vulnerable population.

"Psychopathological effects of the Coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) imposed lockdown on vulnerable patients in treatment in a mental health outpatient department for migrants and individuals in poor socioeconomic conditions","The effects of Sars-Cov-2 pandemic may increase vulnerability of migrants. To investigate the effects of the governmental lockdown on the mental health of vulnerable migrants in treatment at an outpatient department. In a telephone survey post-migration living difficulties and psychopathological symptoms were investigated, particularly post-traumatic thoughts and nightmares, anxiety, depression, feelings of tension and irritability, other sleep problems, as well as COVID-19 related fears. Psychopathological changes during the lockdown were detected and rated by clinicians. Rates of treatment discontinuation and reasons why were also recorded. Of 103 eligible patients, 81 answered the phone call and were included in the study. Mental symptoms were frequent but not as severe as expected. About 32% of patients in psychopharmacological treatment and almost 52% of patients in psychotherapy had discontinued treatment. Patients who were globally considered to have worsened if compared to their pre-coronavirus mental health conditions had in fact higher scores on several mental symptoms but mild specific fears about coronavirus issues, similar to those of patients improved or stable. Worsening was significantly associated with unemployment, lack of VISA, and treatment discontinuation. Shifting the way of providing psychotherapy into a web-based modality was significantly more frequent in stable/improved patients. Findings suggest that concrete life problems and treatment discontinuation more than the coronavirus fear, have predominantly affected the mental health conditions of our patients.","Aragona, Tumiati, Ferrari, Viale, Nicolella, Barbato, Cavani, Costanzo, Mirisola","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020988572","20210113","Asylum seekers; SARS-CoV-2 infection; mental health; psychiatry; psychology; refugees; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9460,""
"Operational experience of the Dutch helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: jeopardy on the prehospital care system?","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has disrupted global and local medical supply chains. To combat the spread of the virus and prevent an uncontrolled outbreak with limited resources, national lockdown protocols have taken effect in the Netherlands since March 13<sup>th</sup>, 2020. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, type and characteristics of HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year prior. A retrospective review of all HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches was performed from the start of Dutch nationwide lockdown orders from March 13th until May 13th, 2020 and the corresponding period one year prior. Dispatch-, operational-, patient-, injury-, and on-site treatment characteristics were extracted for analysis. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel and the time physicians were unable to take call was described. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HEMS and HEMS-ambulance was requested in 528 cases. One year prior, a total of 620 requests were received. The HEMS (helicopter and ambulance) was cancelled after deployment in 56.4% of the COVID-19 cohort and 50.7% of the historical cohort (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Incident location type did not differ between the two cohorts, specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of injuries that occurred at home in pandemic versus non-pandemic circumstances. Besides a decrease in the number of falls, the distribution of mechanisms of injury remained similar during the COVID-19 study period. There was no difference in self-inflicted injuries observed. Prehospital interventions remained similar during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year prior. Specifically, prehospital intubation did not differ between the two cohorts. The rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel was 23.1%. Physicians who tested positive were unable to take call for a mean of 25Ã‚Â days (range 8-53). A decrease in the number of deployments and increase in the number of cancelled missions was observed during the COVID-19 study period. No major differences in operational- and injury characteristics were found for HEMS and HEMS-ambulance dispatches between the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and the same period one year prior. These findings highlight the importance of continued operability of the HEMS, even during pandemic circumstances.

"Longitudinal correlates of loneliness and psychological distress during the lockdown situation due to COVID-19 Effects of age and self-perceptions of aging","To longitudinally analyze the correlates of loneliness and psychological distress in people exposed to the COVID-19 lockdown, exploring the effects of age and self-perceptions of aging (SPA). A longitudinal follow-up of 1549 participants was carried out at four different time points during the lockdown in Spain. Questions about the risk of COVID-19, age, SPA, family and personal resources, loneliness, and psychological distress were measured. Changes in loneliness showed a linear longitudinal trajectory through time, but changes in psychological distress showed a U-shaped relationship with time. Age was a relevant predictor of differences in distress, with older people reporting less psychological distress. Change in both dependent variables was related to change in different predictors like family and personal variables, and also to negative SPA. In a stressful situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults may be more resilient to adverse mental health outcomes by using more adaptive resources that strengthen their resilience. Support is provided for the importance of stereotyped views of the aging process that, independently of chronological age, may put people at risk of suffering adverse mental health outcomes such as loneliness and psychological distress in times of crisis.","Losada-Baltar, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Huertas, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Gonzalo, Pedroso-Chaparro, Gallego-Alberto, Fernandes-Pires, MÃƒÂ¡rquez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab012","20210113","Coping; Crisis; Depression; Expressed emotion; Self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9462,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patient-Reported Outcomes of Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (officially declared on the March 11, 2020), and the resulting measures, are impacting daily life and medical management of breast cancer patients and survivors. We evaluated to what extent these changes have affected quality of life, physical, and psychosocial well-being of patients previously or currently being treated for breast cancer. This study was conducted within a prospective, multicenter cohort of breast cancer patients and survivors (Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaLuAtion). Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, an extra survey was sent to 1595 participants, including the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core (C30) and breast cancer-specific (BR23) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared with the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA pre-COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was assessed using mixed model analysis, adjusting for potential confounders. 1051 patients and survivors (65.9%) completed the survey; 31.1% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°327) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

As Iran was affected by COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly population soon were told to self-isolate for a very long time. We aimed to identify the coverage, efficacy, and integrity of self-isolation and its predictors in the Iranian older adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years) from February 19 to 19 March 2020. <b>Methods:</b> Quota sampling was performed to recruit respondents from 16 cities that were selected based on their population size (4, 7, and 5 cities for localities with Ã¢â€°Â¤500 000, 500 000-1 000 000, and Ã¢â€°Â¥1 000 000 populations) and geographical direction (West = 4 cities; North, East, South, Center = 3 each). At least 30 respondents per locality were selected. Phone interviews of 558 respondents (out of 560; response rate = 99.6%) were performed by local trained interviewers using a validated interview form. Association between age, sex, and living condition (with family vs alone) was assessed with Pearson Chi Square and logistic regression analyses. <b>Results:</b> Complete self-isolation was reported by 61% of the respondents. In 72%, self-isolation led to 80%-100% contact reduction. Self-isolation was broken by 26% of the respondents. Females had better self-isolation behaviors (OR adjusted: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.3) and higher contact reduction rates (p: 0.067). They kept the integrity of self-isolation better (OR adjusted: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7). Those aged older than 80 years were 2.3-folds more likely to completely self-isolate than younger elderly (95% CI adjusted: 1.2, 4.3). Living alone did not significantly predict self-isolation features in the elderly. <b>Conclusion:</b> About one third of the interviewed Iranian older adults did not adhere to important self-isolation measures, with males and younger ages showing lower adherence. With the relaxation of social distancing measures, protection measures of the elderly should be strengthened. Given that prolonged self-isolation adversely affects physical and mental health status of the elderly, it is highly recommended to think of creative and gender-specific methods that best tailor the needs of this population in Iran.","Shati, Alami, Mortazavi, Eybpoosh, Emamian, Moghadam","https://doi.org/10.47176/mjiri.34.152","20210113","Aged; COVID-19; Iran; Isolation; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9464,""

"Assessment of Level of Perceived Stress and Sources of Stress Among Dental Professionals Before and During the COVID -19 Outbreak","The recent spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in a number of mental health issues among healthcare workers and dentists are no exception to this due to their nature of work. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the level of perceived stress (PS) among Chhattisgarh dentists and identify the sources of stress before and during the COVID-19 crisis. An online questionnaire-based survey was done to assess the level of PS using perceived stress scale (PSS) and sources of stress among dentists of Chhattisgarh state of India before the onset of COVID-19 in the state and immediately after the nationwide lockdown was announced owing to COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the type of work, the dental practitioners were categorized into three groups--dental practitioners (group A), dental academicians (group B), and dentists who are practitioners as well as academicians (group C). Frequency, percentages, and mean values were calculated and compared among different participant characteristics using Student's <i>t</i> test, paired <i>t</i> test, and one-way ANOVA. During phase I, mean PSS for dentists was 18.61 Ã‚Â± 6.87 which increased to 20.72 Ã‚Â± 1.95 in phase II. Group C dentists recorded higher mean PSS during phase I, while group A dentists reported higher mean PSS during phase II. No family time due to long working hours (90%) was the major stressor among the three groups of dentists during phase I and concern about getting infected (83.3%) was identified as the most frequent stressor during phase II followed by stress over financial implications.

"Relationship Between Fear of COVID-19, Psychopathology and Sociodemographic Variables in Malaysian Population","COVID-19 has affected Malaysia in multitude aspects. Although Malaysia is on the right track to flatten the curve attributed to swift and decisive actions by the government, it is important to assess the psychological after effect that caused by the pandemic and the movement control order. This study performed in Borneo, Malaysia, was conducted using principles of snowballing, and by invitation through university students and staffs mailing list to participate. The survey collected data on sociodemographic, along with measuring psychological impact by using the newly validated Malay version Fear of COVID-19 Scale and DASS-21 scale. There were a total of 255 respondents. The majority of the respondents' age was 25Ã‚Â years and below, with a female male ratio of 2:1 and around 70% respondents were students. Below 25-year-old age group, and females are having significantly higher levels of fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, and stress. Single people have higher depression level. There was a significant difference between students and non-students for depression, anxiety, and stress, but not for fear of COVID-19. It is imperative to allay the fears and psychological sequalae of COVID-19, especially those individuals at higher risks.

"The Coronavirus and Higher Education: Faculty Viewpoints about Universities Moving Online during a Worldwide Pandemic","The purpose of this study is to examine faculty's views about the move from face-to-face (F2F) instruction to online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The researcher used Q methodology [Q], a mixed method, to determine and describe faculty views about this situation. The participants sorted 36 statements to reveal and describe their subjective viewpoints. In Q, similar sorts are grouped together mathematically into factors, each representing a unique viewpoint. The Q-sorting process is reflective and self-referent. The operation of sorting items allows participants to provide their internal viewpoint. This is different from responding to a Likert-type survey. Additionally, the analyses allow for differentiation of views rather than an aggregate of views. Each unique viewpoint is described by a representative sort, distinguishing statements, and participants' post-sort responses. Three views emerged: <i>Techies who like to teach</i> (the view most positive in relation to teaching online); <i>Overwhelmed as human beings</i> (populated by caregivers); and <i>It's about what cannot be done online</i> (those who are focused on the limitations of technology and abilities for online instruction). Generally, faculty felt frustrated with their ability to best support their students within the online format. Administrators should consider the results of this study to better understand the instructional and mental-health needs of faculty especially in an emergency situation, such as COVID-19. The findings indicate that creating the best learning situations for students is not one-size-fits-all and that there are discipline and pedagogical issues to consider when moving F2F courses online that are not fixed simply with technology.","Ramlo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10755-020-09532-8","20210113","Coronavirus; Faculty; Higher education; Pandemic; Q methodology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9468,""
"Changes of perceptions and behaviours during the phases of COVID-19 pandemic in German elderly people with neurological disorders: an observational study using telephone interviews","Describing perceived limitations in everyday life, psychological burden and approval to easing of measures during the COVID-19 phases in elderly people with neurological disorders. Observational, prospective study SETTING: This is a monocentric study conducted at a university hospital in Germany. Overall, 452 elderly people participated in the NeuroGerAdh study (DRKS00016774) and were interviewed by telephone between 18 March and 30 August 2020. Overall, 307 (67.9%) patients had relevant limitations in daily life due to the measures. These limitations significantly decreased during the pandemic phases. At the beginning of the pandemic, people complained about restricted social contacts and mobility, which were the most common reasons for perceived limitations in daily life. Later, since June 2020, wearing a mouth-nose mask had become the main reason for perceived limitations. In the elastic net regularisation, model higher perceived limitations in daily life were among others associated with younger age and earlier pandemic phases. Higher psychological burden was mainly associated with early pandemic phase, younger age and depression.The perceived psychological burden decreased as the pandemic phases passed, even though the reasons for psychological burden (anxiety or fear of infection, insecurity and concerns) did not remarkably change during the phases. From 16 June 2020, the patients were asked whether they approve the easing of measures. Sixty-seven of 136 patients (49.3%) approved and 55 (40.4%) did not. The common reasons for disapproval were fear of increased risk of infection and irresponsible behaviour of other people. While limitations in daily life decreased during the study period, anxiety remains a common psychological burden in elderly sick people, and this needs special attention. Accordingly, most people do not approve easing of measures. Special strategies are needed to cope with changing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zipprich, SchÃƒÂ¶nenberg, Teschner, Prell","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045780","20210113","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; neurology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9469,""
"Examining the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family mental health in Canada: findings from a national cross-sectional study","In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation, school/child care closures and employment instability have created unprecedented conditions for families raising children at home. This study describes the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on families with children in Canada. This descriptive study used a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of adults living in Canada (n=3000) to examine the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes among parents with children &lt;18 years old living at home (n=618) were compared with the rest of the sample. Data were collected via an online survey between 14 May to 29 May 2020. Participants reported on changes to their mental health since the onset of the pandemic and sources of stress, emotional responses, substance use patterns and suicidality/self-harm. Additionally, parents identified changes in their interactions with their children, impacts on their children's mental health and sources of support accessed. 44.3% of parents with children &lt;18 years living at home reported worse mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 35.6% of respondents without children &lt;18 living at home, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> (1, n=3000)=16.2, p&lt;0.001. More parents compared with the rest of the sample reported increased alcohol consumption (27.7% vs 16.1%, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> (1, n=3000)=43.8, p&lt;0.001), suicidal thoughts/feelings (8.3% vs 5.2%, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> (1, n=3000)=8.0, p=0.005) and stress about being safe from physical/emotional domestic violence (11.5% vs 7.9%, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> (1, n=3000)=8.1, p=0.005). 24.8% (95% CI 21.4 to 28.4) of parents reported their children's mental health had worsened since the pandemic. Parents also reported more frequent negative as well as positive interactions with their children due to the pandemic (eg, more conflicts, 22.2% (95% CI 19.0 to 25.7); increased feelings of closeness, 49.7% (95% CI 45.7 to 53.7)). This study identifies that families with children &lt;18 at home have experienced deteriorated mental health due to the pandemic. Population-level responses are required to adequately respond to families' diverse needs and mitigate the potential for widening health and social inequities for parents and children.","Gadermann, Thomson, Richardson, GagnÃƒÂ©, McAuliffe, Hirani, Jenkins","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042871","20210113","COVID-19; community child health; epidemiology; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9470,""
"Survey of CAMHS clinicians about their experience of remote consultation: brief report","The Covid-19 crisis necessitated rapid adoption of remote consultations across National Health Service (NHS) child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). This study aimed to understand practitioners' experiences of rapid implementation of remote consultations across CAMHS in one NHS trust in the east of England. Data were collected through a brief questionnaire documenting clinicians' experiences following remote delivery of services. The questionnaire began before 'lockdown' and focused on assessment consultations (n = 102) as part of a planned move to virtual assessment. As the roll-out of remote consultations was extended at lockdown, we extended the questionnaire to include all remote clinical contacts (n = 202). Despite high levels of initial concern, clinicians' reports were positive overall; importantly, however, their experiences varied by team. When restrictions on face-to-face working are lifted, a blended approach of remote and face-to-face service delivery is recommended to optimise access and capacity while retaining effective and safe care.","Bhardwaj, Moore, Cardinal, Bradley, Cross, Ford","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.160","20210113","CAMHS; Covid-19; digital health; remote consultation; service delivery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9471,""

"Depression, risk factors, and coping strategies in the context of social dislocations resulting from the second wave of COVID-19 in Japan","Social dislocations resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been prolonged, which has led to general population social suppression. The present study aimed to reveal risk factors associated with mental health problems and suggest concrete coping strategies in the context of COVID-19. A web-based survey was conducted in July when Japan was experiencing a second wave of COVID-19. Demographics, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), state anger, anger control, and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analysis on PHQ-9 scores by set variables was conducted. The participants were 2708 individuals, and 18.35% of them were depressed. Logistic regression analysis showed that in the order of odds ratios (ORs), underlying disease (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.32-2.92), not working (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.85, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.22-2.80), negative economic impact (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.33, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.01-1.77), state anger (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.17, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.14-1.21), anger control (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.08, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.04-1.13), age (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.97, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.96-0.98), high income (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.45, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25-0.80), and being married (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.53, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.38-0.74) were predictors of depressive symptoms. Regarding coping strategies, planning (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.84, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.74-0.94), use of instrumental support (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.76-0.95), denial (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.88, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.77-0.99), behavioural disengagement (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.28, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.13-1.44), and self-blame (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.47, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31-1.65) were associated with probable depression. During prolonged psychological distress caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japan was two to nine times as high as before the COVID-19 pandemic, even though Japan was not a lockdown country. Although some coping strategies were useful for maintaining mental health, such as developing ways, alone or with others, to address or avoid social dislocations, the influence of demographics was more powerful than these coping strategies, and medical treatments are needed for high-risk individuals.","Fukase, Ichikura, Murase, Tagaya","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03047-y","20210113","Coping strategies; General population; Mental health; Prevalence; Risk factor for increased depression; The second wave of COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9474,""
"Mental health problems and social supports in the COVID-19 healthcare workers: a Chinese explanatory study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in China and other overseas areas, which has aroused widespread concern. The sharp increase in the number of patients has led to great psychological pressure on health care workers. The purpose of this study was to understand their mental health status and needs, so as to provide a scientific basis for alleviating the psychological pressure of health care workers. Using a cross-sectional study design, 540 health care workers were randomly selected from two designated tuberculosis medical institutions in Anhui Province. The basic situation, perceived social support, depression level, loneliness and COVID-19 related knowledge were collected and analyzed by questionnaire. A total of 511 valid questionnaires were finally retrieved. There were 139 people in epidemic prevention and control positions (27.20%). Depression level: People in isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were at the level of mild to moderate depression. Female was higher than male; nurse was higher than doctor; middle and junior job titles were higher than senior titles; junior college degree or below were higher than bachelor's degree, master's degree and above; isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly higher than those of non-prevention and control positions (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Loneliness scores: Doctors were higher than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were higher than those of other medical departments (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Social support: Doctors were lower than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly lower than those of other departments (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The score of social support was negatively correlated with depression and loneliness (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), while depression was positively correlated with loneliness (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Health care workers most want to receive one-to-one psychological counseling (29.75%), and provide crisis management (24.07%). The awareness rate of health care workers on COVID-19's knowledge was relatively high. The psychological problems of health care workers, especially women, nurses with low educational background, low professional title, and staff in the epidemic prevention and control positions are relatively serious.","Fang, Wu, Lu, Kan, Wang, Xiong, Ma, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02998-y","20210113","COVID-19; Depression; Lonely; Social support; Tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9475,""
"Psychological distress and feelings of loneliness: What are the impacts of Covid-19 losckdown on the French population?","The COVID-19 pandemic created a worldwide health crisis. This crisis resulted in an almost two-month lockdown in France â€” lockdown that has serious impacts on physical and mental health. This unprecedented situation resulted in an important reflection about the mental health of the persons experiencing this crisis. The aim of our study was to apprehend the emotional state of the persons experiencing this lockdown, taking into account day-to-day life and feelings of loneliness. In order to develop a good comprehension of the impact of this situation on mental health, we recruited 4689 persons through an online survey between March 17th and May 11th of 2020 in France. We used several psychometric tools that gave us access to various data, such as socio-biographical information, situational variables â€” place of living, work context, etc. â€” and psychological state â€” depressive symptoms, anxiety, loneliness, etc. This paper focuses mostly on the UCLA loneliness scale, and the French Canadian version of the Psychiatric Symptoms Index (PSI), which measures psychological distress, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Results show a moderate psychological distress for 27.5% of our sample, with depressive symptomatology, irritability or cognitive impairment. There is also a high loneliness feeling in 21.8% of the sample. Psychological distress is explained by sociodemographic variables â€” such as gender and age â€” but also by situational information â€” type of housing and persistence of income â€” and the loneliness feeling. If this pandemic and this lockdown show a clear impact on the emotional life of the French population, these results need to be taken into account with a broader range of situational and psychological variables. These additional data would help us have a more thorough understanding of the underlying factors explaining this difficult experience of the crisis. This comprehension also needs to go further in time and think about the repercussions beyond the end of the lockdown, in order to observe the evolution of these emotions and the potential persistence of psychological distress.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100189","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9476,""
"Perinatal Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence for Heightened Distress in Pregnant Women Highlights the Need for Novel Interventions","This manuscript reports on a sample of 641 pregnant women surveyed in spring 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when social distancing was at its peak in the United States. Expectant mothers described elevated psychological distress, perceived stress, loneliness, and many behavioral changes. More than half of the women in the sample endorsed depressive symptoms above clinical threshold and two-thirds reported clinically significant anxiety, with average scores for depression, anxiety, and stress more than a standard deviation higher than those measured pre-pandemic. Given this early evidence for heightened distress, treatment options that can be targeted to support perinatal women and comply with social distancing guidelines are needed. The final sections of this paper highlight the promising role of telehealth modalities and discuss specific interventions, such as Interpersonal Therapy, that may be particularly useful in treating perinatal women in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public Significance: The COVID-19 pandemic has had sweeping effects on perinatal mental health, which in turn has wide-ranging impacts for maternal, child, and family well-being. This paper describes treatment approaches that may ameliorate the pandemicâ€™s impact.","Alyssa Rae Morris et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-F14-0E7","20210114","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Couples, Marriage, and Family; covid-19; prenatal depression; perinatal mental health; coronavirus; social connection","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-14","",9477,""
