"Editorial: The Nine Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health","Grand global challenges significantly impact mental health and well-being in vulnerable populations across the globe. Today, national health systems and infrastructures are often not sufficiently equipped to react effectively to these grand challenges' multiple and interrelated consequences. The World Health Organization has identified 13 urgent health challenges for the upcoming decade (see Table 1). From our perspective, nine of these challenges are crucial not only for global health but also for Global Mental Health.","Bajbouj, Malek, Ta, Thi Minh Tam, Hassan, Ghayda, Hahn, Eric","https://www.google.com/search?q=Editorial:+The+Nine+Grand+Challenges+in+Global+Mental+Health","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in psychiatry; 12, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38477,""

"Housing space and occupancy standards: developing evidence for policy from a health and wellbeing perspective in the UK context","Issues of domestic space standards and occupancy levels rarely receive much attention in debates about UK housing and planning policies. This is exemplified by examining the history of space and occupancy standards as applied in England, demonstrating that standards have been under-specified, partial in coverage, and applied inconsistently. The outcomes are seen in the production of relatively small homes, overcrowding and (perversely) extensive under-occupation, residential dissatisfaction and mobility. Evidence for the health and wellbeing impacts of space shortages highlights the consequences for infectious diseases, particularly respiratory illness, mental health and stress, and educational attainment. Moreover, the mediating and moderating roles of domestic space upon the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic show the crucial importance of space and occupancy standards for health, wellbeing and learning in a future where more time is spent at home. Areas of future research are identified which together could help address a probable underestimate of the current health sector costs of inadequate domestic space, this being an important lever for policy action. Such evidence, including crucially more from the UK itself, has an important role to play if stronger, more effective policies are to be developed and implemented in this area in future.","Kearns, Ade","https://doi.org/10.1080/09613218.2021.2024756","","Database: Taylor & Francis; Publication type: article; Publication details: Building Research & Information;: 1-16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38479,""

"Use of Information and Communication Technologies to Enhance Self-Acupressure: a Literature Review","Currently, acupressure is widely accepted as a non-pharmacological therapy for managing pain, nausea and vomiting, and mental health conditions. Since acupressure can be self-administered, clinicians and researchersâ€™ interest in information and communication technologies (ICTs) for disseminating acupressure to manage symptoms has increased. This mini review was conducted to examine clinical studies of acupressure using ICTs, with a particular focus on self-acupressure. Through a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL, all studies of self-acupressure using ICTs published before December 31, 2021 were collected. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. More than half of the studies published since 2020 (4/7, 54.14%) were described as being related to COVID-19. As target conditions, musculoskeletal injuries or pain, cancer-related symptoms, dysmenorrhea, mental health issues, and obesity were considered. The most frequently used acupoints were LI4, LR3, and Shenmen. Moreover, smartphone applications were the most commonly used ICT method to support self-acupressure. In addition to the basic information of self-acupressure, other tools such as timers, reminders, and schedule checkers to facilitate its implementations have been incorporated into the smartphone applications. Recently, there have been some attempts to combine acupressure and ICTs. Although these studies mainly focus on musculoskeletal pain or injuries, recent studies related to mental health have emerged in relation to COVID-19. However, few studies have been conducted to date, making it difficult to fully grasp the trends in this field. Therefore, more studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combining self-acupressure and ICTs in more diverse clinical areas.","Kwon, C. Y.; Yeh, C.

"Perceived Stress and Quality of Life in Healthcare Workers of Non-COVID-19-Designated Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ukraine","Introduction. Healthcare workers are more vulnerable to negative influences of the Covid-19 pandemic than cross-border travelers as they experience greater occupational stress, exacerbated by the possibility of self-contamination or contamination of their relatives through direct contact with patients, reduced social communication, deterioration in self-care and quality of life due to lack of energy and time. The aim of the study was to assess the level of stress and quality of life in healthcare workers of nonCOVID-19-designated hospitals in Ukraine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods. There was carried out a case-control study that included 150 respondents divided into three groups: experimental groups (EG) 1 and 2 comprised 50 physicians and 50 nurses of non-COVID19-designated hospitals, respectively;the control group (CG) included 50 healthy individuals not working in the healthcare field. The data were collected using paper questionnaires involving sociodemographic questions, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Results. EG 1 and EG 2 had significantly increased stress levels as compared to the CG. Physical functioning criterion in EG 2 was significantly lower than those in EG 1 and the CG. Vitality and social functioning indicators were significantly lower in EG 1 and EG 2 as compared to the CG. Quality of mental health was worse in EG 1 than in the CG. Conclusions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers of non-COVID-19-designated hospitals experienced a significant reorganization of their work environment, which required them to adjust rapidly to new conditions and psychological difficulties. The medical staff was found to have an increased level of perceived stress and decreased quality of life, which could affect the quality of medical care. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development and implementation of stress coping measures to improve mental and physical health of healthcare workers, which can be used to achieve proper work and rest routines, create a microclimate within the team, and restore the work-life balance.","Mats, O.; Karpik, Z.; Boiko, D.; Rud, V.; Zhyvotovska, L.","https://doi.org/10.21802/gmj.2022.3.3","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Galician Medical Journal; 29(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38482,""
"Stress and burden among caregivers of persons with bipolar affective disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in India","Introduction: Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is a severe mental illness causing significant problems in the lives of individuals with the disorder and those who care for them as well are. Most of the time people with mental illness are taken care of by mental health professionals, while little priority is given to their caregivers. There are numerous studies in India attempting to understand the impact of illness on caregivers and the problems faced by the caregivers of persons with BPAD. Methods: The study aimed to assess the family caregivers' stress and burden among caregivers of persons with BPAD at a tertiary care center in Dharwad, India. Descriptive research design and simple random sampling was used for recruiting 50 samples. Apart from sociodemographic schedule, burden assessment scale and perceived stress scale (PSS) were used for data collection. Results: The mean age of caregivers was 44.76 years. The average duration of illness of the patients was 9.80 years and their mean annual income was 35,500 rupees reported in the study. The mean score of impact of wellbeing subscale was higher (11.34) when compared with other sub scales of the burden assessment scale, and the overall score of burden assessment scale (31.82) indicated high levels of burden. PSS mean was 21.44, indicating high stress levels. Conclusion: The study concludes that burden and perceived stress were elevated among the caregivers of people with BPAD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sandya, P. D.; Shetty, K.

"Mental health and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures among young adults in Bogota, Colombia","We sought to explore mental health and psychosocial impact among young people (18 to 24 years old) in Bogota during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We carried a cross sectional study using a web-based survey to assess mental health and personal impact among 18 to 24 years old living in Bogota during the first 4 months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The depressive symptoms were measured with PHQ-8 and anxiety symptoms with (GAD-7). We also designed a questionnaire exploring changes in personal, family and social life. Results: Overall, 23% of the sample (n = 834) reported mild depressive symptoms (males 24% and females 23%);29% reported moderate depressive symptoms (males 28%, females 30%);22% moderate-severe symptoms (males 20%, females 23%) and 17% severe symptoms (males 15%, females 17%). Mild anxiety symptoms were reported by 29% of the sample (males 30%, females 29%);moderate anxiety symptoms by 29% (males 26%, females 30%);moderate-severe 18% (males 15%, females 20%) and severe anxiety by 6.0% (males 6.0% and females 6.0%). High symptoms of depression (PHQ-8 &gt;= 10) were associated with being female, considering that the quarantine was stressful, having one member of the family losing their job, worsening of family relationships, decrease of physical activity and having a less nutritious diet. Having high anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 &gt;= 10) were associated with sometimes not having enough money to buy food. Conclusions: The first months of the pandemic lockdown were associated with high depressive and anxiety symptoms among young persons living in Bogota, Colombia. Increasing public health measures to provide support for young people is needed during lockdowns and it is necessary to further explore the long-term mental health impact due to personal, family and social changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Uribe-Restrepo, J.

"Relationship between the Length of Isolation and Swab Results with Degree of Anxiety and Depression Disorders in Patients with Confirmed of Coronavirus Disease 2019","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the burden of psychological stress. AIM: This study aims to determine the relationship between the length of isolation, the results of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction swab test, the time of reporting, and the level of knowledge with the degree of depression and anxiety in patients with swab results confirmed by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This study is an analytical observational study with a cross-sectional design. After the data were collected, a bivariate statistical analysis was carried out for the Kruskalâ€“Wallis and Spearman Test. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in this study. CONCLUSION: The study found that the length of isolation, frequency of swab, the time spent focusing on COVID-19, and level of knowledge were not related to the degree of depression and anxiety.

"Home-Based Respiratory Care for COPD Patients","Despite significant advances in pharmacological treatment over the last few decades, COPD remains a heavy burden on the health systems around the world, affecting approximately 210 million people, with elevated morbimortality and socioeconomic impact. Barriers to healthcare access were even more evident during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and increased patients' vulnerability to physical deconditioning, depression, and social isolation. Home-based respiratory care in patients with COPD provides a valuable contribution to effective disease management, with potential advantages for monitoring, treatment adherence, and cost reduction. Technological innovation allows clinical markers of interest, such as respiratory frequency, pulmonary function, and oxygen saturation, to be tracked remotely from the patients' homes, providing a better understanding of their real needs. Home-based telerehabilitation can also be a viable alternative to hospital-based programs. Here, we highlight the full extent of health benefits of HRC in COPD, particularly for patients with a higher risk of exacerbations, multiple comorbidities, and limited access to health services.","Figueiredo, Ricardo G.; Laudano, Caio, Muniz, Jaqueline, de Bessa, JosÃ©","https://doi.org/10.3390/sinusitis6020007","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sinusitis; 6(2):49-55, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38487,""
"Molecular Bases of Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressant-Attributed Effects in COVID-19: A New Insight on the Role of Bradykinins","Widely available effective drugs to treat coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are still limited. Various studies suggested the potential contribution of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants to alleviate the clinical course of COVID-19. Initially, SSRI antidepressant-attributed anti-COVID-19 activity was attributed to their direct agonistic or indirect serotonin-mediated stimulation of sigma-1 receptors (Sig1-R). Thereafter, attention was drawn to the property of SSRI antidepressants to decrease ceramide production, as functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase. Ceramides are cell membrane waxy lipids formed by sphingosine and a fatty acid, playing a major role in receptor signaling and infection. In COVID-19 patients, ceramide production is increased due to acid sphingomyelinase activation. Here, we aimed to review the relationships between bradykinins and the proposed pathways supporting SSRI antidepressant-attributed effectiveness in COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, bradykinin receptor-B1 stimulation is enhanced following the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, which is responsible for the inactivation of des-Arg9-bradykinin, a bradykinin metabolite, contrasting with the decrease in bradykinin receptor-B2 (BDKRB2) stimulation, which results from the inhibition of cathepsin L, a kininogenase involved in bradykinin production and present at the infection site. Sig1-R stimulation modulates the inflammatory response by regulating cytokine production and counterbalances COVID-19-attributed BDKRB2 inhibition by potentiating its effects on the cytosolic calcium concentration. Moreover, the beneficial effects obtained with acid sphingomyelinase inhibition are parallel to those expected with BDKRB2 stimulation in COVID-19. Altogether, these findings suggest that one ultimate pathway of SSRI antidepressant-attributed anti-COVID-19 activity is the potentiation of BDKRB2 effects shown to be inhibited in COVID-19. In conclusion, SSRI antidepressants are able to interact positively with the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in COVID-19. However, their exact benefits in preventing morbidities or improving the outcome in COVID-19 patients remain unknown.","Gouda, Ahmed S.; MÃ©garbane, Bruno","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12091487","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(9):1487, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38488,""
"'OFF TO WAR WHEN I DIDN'T SIGN UP!', SUPPORTING HOSPICE STAFF MENTAL HEALTH DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC","Wellbeing and Mental Health initiatives put in place during the pandemic. The emotional and psychological pressures of working within hospice care are well documented, however, the addition of a global pandemic plunged hospice workforces into an unknown and unchartered way of working. Suddenly the switch from dealing with the everyday death and dying of patients, changed to having staff 's own mortality, fear and anxiety thrust into reality. Unforeseen challenges within the workplace led to many staff experiencing emotions and anxieties that could not have been predicted. The quick succession of events that changed everyday practice at the beginning of the pandemic gave rise to a number of initiatives implemented to support staff mental health and wellbeing. These have included:â€¢Wobble room - a designated safe place for staff to visit and relax in.â€¢Wobble room booklet for those working offsite.â€¢Gifts of meals and drinks from local companies.â€¢Mindfulness and relaxation.â€¢Self-help videos. The number of Mental Health First Aiders and freedom to speak up guardians has been increased across the workforce. In addition to this, staff were given information and contact details for a multitude of both national and local support avenues such as the Samaritans, NHS, Here for you and MIND, enabling support virtually through websites, webinars, online training and apps. Within the hospice a focus on wellbeing was central to communications on the workplace intranet. This then resulted in the sign up of 15 new workplace health champions who will support ongoing activities throughout the year. The initiatives that have proved successful will continue to be offered and available to staff as we transition away from COVID-19 and maintain a focus on staff wellbeing within the organisation.","Shukla, L.; Homewood, J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2021-Hospice.205","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care; 11:A77, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38489,""

"COMMUNITY PALLIATIVE CARE RESPONSE TO SUPPORT CARE HOME RESIDENTS AND STAFF DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Aim To review our response to support residents and staff in Bromley Care Homes during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020-March 2021), reflect on our learning, joint working with colleagues and identify good practice to inform future models of care. Methods We collated clinical activity data and key case reviews of care home patients referred to our service over the year. Contemporaneous notes from formal/informal reflections and debriefs (internal and joint with GPs/CCG/other professionals) were reviewed. Themes from feedback of care home staff and managers (ad hoc and formal focus groups) were included with personal reflections. Results 345 patients were referred from 32 care homes. The majority (45%) in Quarter 1 (first wave), 14% in both Q2/Q3 and 27% in Q4 (second wave). Median age 89(53-110) with 69% &gt;85 years;two-thirds female. 80% had a non-malignant primary diagnosis. Just over half died within the year;median time referral-to-death 17(0-229) days, 81(23%) remained on the caseload April 2021. Key themes in Q1 included: limited effectiveness of virtual assessments, atypical patient presentations, significant impact of social isolation on mental health/function, with families unable to advocate and inconsistent messaging about visiting rights. Care home staff were distressed, burnt out, feeling unsupported. In Q2/Q3 regular GSF meetings with care home-GPs, virtual teaching (webinars/ECHO) and staff 'cascade project' study days helped consolidate learning. The second wave was heralded by an outbreak in extra-care housing;care home-GPs were self-isolating. We led urgent senior clinical review and response. In Q4, daily COVID-19 monitoring meetings were key (representation from CCG, Public Health, Pharmacy, CH-GPs and St Christopher's). Over a month, successive outbreaks were identified and resources coordinated to ensure clear advance care plans, timely review, targeted multiprofessional support to care home staff. Learning from each setting informed changes to approach in the next, including: understanding culture, correcting/enhancing infection control procedures, improved shared decision making and addressing hydration.

"Assessing the outcomes of patients requiring intensive care unit admission for severe COVID-19 pneumonia","Intensive care unit (ICU) admission has significant long-term sequelae, affecting both physical and mental health [1]. Long-term respiratory outcomes in COVID- 19 ICU patients has been of concern and the British Thoracic Society recommends a post-hospital-discharge chest X-ray (CXR) and clinic follow-up [2]. We aimed to establish the long-term health outcomes of patients with COVID-19 following admission to ICU. Methods All patients admitted to ICU at University Hospital Crosshouse with COVID-19 from 01/03/2020-31/08/2021 were identified retrospectively. A comparator prepandemic dataset of patients admitted with pneumonia from 01/07/2018-31/12/ 2019 was also identified. Re-admissions were excluded in both cohorts. Electronic notes were interrogated for demographics, outcomes and follow-up. This included attendance at our post-ICU recovery programme, InS:PIRE. Statistical analysis was by Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U-test. Results A total of 135 patients were admitted during the COVID-19 period, with 52 patients admitted in the pre-pandemic period. Comparisons between the groups are shown in Table 1. Of the 78 COVID-19 survivors, 48 (61.5%) had a CXR after hospital discharge. In 50%, this was abnormal. Thirty patients (38.5%) had evidence of outpatient respiratory follow-up, with four (13.3%) were now receiving long-term oxygen therapy. Of the 37% who had completed InS:PIRE by the time of data collection, most did not feel back to baseline, with best health scores averaging 66% of normal. Impairment in usual daily activities was the main issue. (Table Presented) Discussion We demonstrate admission to ICU with COVID-19 is associated with prolonged ventilation, high mortality and significant ongoing morbidity among survivors. Chest X-rays remain abnormal in half of patients after hospital discharge and many remain significantly functionally impaired. The low rates of respiratory follow- up is concerning and may mean our study underestimates the problem. Continued follow-up of survivors of severe COVID-19 is, therefore, crucial and will allow us to identify ongoing clinical and rehabilitation needs as well as enable access to appropriate support.","Robertson, R.; McCallum, A.; O'Brien, P.","https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15766","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Anaesthesia; 77:19, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38492,""

"Perceived stress and associated factors among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic period in Northwest Ethiopia, 2020: a cross-sectional study","This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of perceived stress among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study. University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. A total of 415 pregnant women were recruited by using a systematic random sampling technique from 28 April 2020 to 12 June 2020. The required data were collected through face-to-face interviews. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Oslo Social Support Scale 3 were used for associated factors. The data were analysed by using SPSS V.20. We also included sociodemographic, obstetrical and gynaecology, substance use and intimate partner-related factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify associated factors with perceived stress. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the effect of each independent variable with the outcome variable. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. A total of 415 pregnant women participated in the study with response rate of 98.57%. The prevalence of perceived stress is found to be 13.7% (95% CI=10.4% to 17.1%). According to the multivariable logistic regression result, being a student (adjusted OR (AOR)=9.67, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=2.739 to 34.183), being at the first and third trimesters of gestational age (AOR=3.56, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=1.065 to 11.885; AOR=4.80, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=1.851 to 14.479, respectively), and having antenatal depression (AOR=3.51, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=1.628 to 7.563) were factors positively associated with perceived stress. The prevalence of perceived stress among pregnant people was relatively high. This study recommends that all pregnant people should be screened and treated for perceived stress particularly during the first and third trimesters. Emphasis should be given to early detection and treatment of antenatal depression. Pregnant students must be strongly evaluated and intervened for perceived stress.","Biresaw, Takelle, Gebeyehu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063041","20220929","epidemiology; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38494,""
"Protocol for a systematic review of interventions targeting mental health, cognition or psychological well-being among individuals with long COVID","For some people, COVID-19 infection leads to negative health impacts that can last into the medium or long term. The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection, or 'long COVID', negatively affects not only physical health, but also mental health, cognition or psychological well-being. Complex, integrated interventions are recommended for long COVID, including psychological components; however, the effectiveness of such interventions has yet to be critically evaluated. This protocol describes a systematic review to be conducted of scientific literature reporting on clinical trials of interventions to promote mental health, cognition or psychological well-being among individuals with long COVID. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines will be followed. A health sciences librarian will identify the relevant literature through comprehensive systematic searches of Medline, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, medRxiv, PsyArXiv, China National Knowledge Internet and WANFANG Data databases, as well as The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Studies will be selected through a title and abstract review, followed by a full-text review using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extracted will include intervention descriptions and efficacy metrics. Data will be narratively synthesised; if the data allow, a meta-analysis will be conducted. Risk of bias assessment will be conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Ethical approval for systematic reviews is not required. As researchers and clinicians respond to the new clinical entity that long COVID represents, this review will synthesise a rapidly emerging evidence base describing and testing interventions to promote mental health, cognition or psychological well-being. Results will therefore be disseminated through an open-access peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations to inform research and clinical practice.

"Paradoxical effects of ethnic identification on threat and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic A study of ethnic minority and immigrant groups","Studies based on the ""social cure"" hypothesis suggest the positive role of strong social identifications for well-being and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the three-factorial model of identification that distinguishes ingroup centrality, ingroup affect, and ingroup ties as separate aspects of group identification, we propose that their impact on COVID-19-related stress and anxiety would be more complex. In a set of three studies carried out among ethnic minorities in Poland (Lemkos, Kashubs, and Silesians) and a study of a large immigrant group (Ukrainians in Poland), we found that higher levels of ingroup centrality generate more COVID-19-related threats and higher levels of anxiety, whereas ingroup ties tend to reduce anxiety during the pandemic. Based on this evidence we propose that the more exclusive aspects of identification (ingroup centrality) pose a risk to mental health during the time of the pandemic, whereas the more binding ones (ingroup ties) serve as a true ""social cure.""

"Time perspective predicts levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-cultural study","The COVID-19 outbreak and governmental measures to keep the population safe had a great impact on many aspects of society, including well-being. Using data from N = 1281 participants from six countries (Argentina, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Turkey), we first explored differences in anxiety, depression (measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS), and time perspectives (Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory; ZTPI), between these countries during the first weeks of the pandemic. We observed that Turkish participants reported the highest levels of anxiety, and Japanese and Greek the lowest. For depression symptoms, the Japanese scored highest and Italians lowest. Next, for each country, we investigated how well the relatively time-stable personality traits of time perspectives, chronotype (reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire; rMEQ), and Big Five personality traits (short Big Five Inventory; BFI) predicted the levels of anxiety and depression (HADS). The regression analyses showed that negative attitudes towards the past predicted the levels of both anxiety and depression in most of the countries we analyzed. Additionally, in many countries, a Past Positive orientation negatively predicted depression whereas the Present Fatalistic subscale predicted anxiety and depression. The chronotype did not contribute additionally to the models. The Big Five traits (and particularly neuroticism) showed substantial incremental explanatory power for anxiety in some countries but did not consistently predict anxiety levels. For depression, the additional variance accounted for by including the BFI as predictors was rather small. Importantly, the ZTPI subscales were retained as significant predictors in the model still when the BFI and rMEQ were considered as potential predictors. Our results yield evidence that the ZTPI time perspectives are valuable predictors for anxiety and depression levels during the first period of the pandemic.","Micillo, Rioux, Mendoza, KÃƒÂ¼bel, Cellini, Van Wassenhove, Grondin, Mioni","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269396","20220929","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38497,""
"Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 symptom phenotypes and therapeutic strategies: A prospective, observational study","Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) includes a heterogeneous group of patients with variable symptomatology, who may respond to different therapeutic interventions. Identifying phenotypes of PASC and therapeutic strategies for different subgroups would be a major step forward in management. In a prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 12-month symptoms and quantitative outcome metrics were collected. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses were performed to identify patients with: (1) similar symptoms lasting Ã¢â€°Â¥4 weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (2) similar therapeutic interventions. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association of these symptom and therapy clusters with quantitative 12-month outcome metrics (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, NIH NeuroQoL). Among 242 patients, 122 (50%) reported Ã¢â€°Â¥1 PASC symptom (median 3, IQR 1-5) lasting a median of 12-months (range 1-15) post-COVID diagnosis. Cluster analysis generated three symptom groups: Cluster1 had few symptoms (most commonly headache); Cluster2 had many symptoms including high levels of anxiety and depression; and Cluster3 primarily included shortness of breath, headache and cognitive symptoms. Cluster1 received few therapeutic interventions (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-5.9), Cluster2 received several interventions, including antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications and psychological therapy (OR 15.7, 95% CI 4.1-59.7) and Cluster3 primarily received physical and occupational therapy (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.3-7.1). The most severely affected patients (Symptom Cluster 2) had higher rates of disability (worse modified Rankin scores), worse NeuroQoL measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep disorder, and a higher number of stressors (all P&lt;0.05). 100% of those who received a treatment strategy that included psychiatric therapies reported symptom improvement, compared to 97% who received primarily physical/occupational therapy, and 83% who received few interventions (P = 0.042). We identified three clinically relevant PASC symptom-based phenotypes, which received different therapeutic interventions with varying response rates. These data may be helpful in tailoring individual treatment programs.","Frontera, Thorpe, Simon, de Havenon, Yaghi, Sabadia, Yang, Lewis, Melmed, Balcer, Wisniewski, Galetta","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275274","20220929","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38498,""
"Telemedicine management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in obese and overweight young and middle-aged patients during COVID-19 outbreak: A single-center, prospective, randomized control study","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic severely affected the disease management of patients with chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to assess the effect of telemedicine management of diabetes in obese and overweight young and middle-aged patients with T2DM during the COVID-19 pandemic. A single-center randomized control study was conducted in 120 obese or overweight (body mass index [BMI] Ã¢â€°Â¥ 24 kg/m2) young and middle-aged patients (aged 18-55 years) with T2DM. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (telemedicine) or control (conventional outpatient clinic appointment) group. After baseline assessment, they were home isolated for 21 days, received diet and exercise guidance, underwent glucose monitoring, and followed up for 6 months. Glucose monitoring and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were evaluated at 22 days and at the end of 3 and 6 months. Ninety-nine patients completed the 6-month follow-up (intervention group: n = 52; control group: n = 47). On day 22, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level of the intervention group was lower than that of the control group (p &lt; 0.05), and the control group's SDS increased significantly compared with the baseline value (p &lt; 0.05). At the end of 3 months, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and FBG levels in the intervention group decreased significantly compared with those in the control group (p &lt; 0.01). At the end of 6 months, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in postprandial blood glucose, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as well as waist-to-hip ratio compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05); moreover, the intervention group showed lower SDS scores than the baseline value (p &lt; 0.05). Further, the intervention group showed a significant reduction in BMI compared with the control group at the end of 3 and 6 months (p &lt; 0.01).

"Implementing the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Strategic Vision in the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences-2022 Update","Spurred by the 2016 release of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Strategic Vision, the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences developed its Strategic Vision Implementation Plan-a blueprint for reigniting the decline in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates, improving health equity, and accelerating translation of scientific discoveries into better cardiovascular health (CVH). The 6 scientific focus areas of the Strategic Vision Implementation Plan reflect the multifactorial nature of CVD and include (1) addressing social determinants of CVH and health inequities, (2) enhancing resilience, (3) promoting CVH and preventing CVD across the lifespan, (4) eliminating hypertension-related CVD, (5) reducing the burden of heart failure, and (6) preventing vascular dementia. This article presents an update of strategic vision implementation activities within Division of Cardiovascular Sciences. Overarching and cross-cutting themes include training the scientific workforce and engaging the extramural scientific community to stimulate transformative research in cardiovascular sciences. In partnership with other NIH Institutes, Federal agencies, industry, and the extramural research community, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences strategic vision implementation has stimulated development of numerous workshops and research funding opportunities. Strategic Vision Implementation Plan activities highlight innovative intervention modalities, interdisciplinary systems approaches to CVD reduction, a life course framework for CVH promotion and CVD prevention, and multi-pronged research strategies for combatting COVID-19. As new knowledge, technologies, and areas of scientific research emerge, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences will continue its thoughtful approach to strategic vision implementation, remaining poised to seize emerging opportunities and catalyze breakthroughs in cardiovascular sciences.","Grant, Pratt, Wong, Addou, Desvigne-Nickens, Campo, Donze, Barnes, Schopfer, Jaquish, Fleg, Galis, Fenton, Oh, Hong, Chen, Wang, Fine, Goff","https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321449","20220929","cardiovascular diseases; heart failure; hypertension; social determinants of health; strategic vision; vascular dementia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38500,""

However, these effects are subject to many modulatory factors from a plethora of domains of examination. It is important to understand the intersection of societal and individual levels for global stressors compared with local phenomena and physical-health outcomes. Here, we consider three perspectives: international/cultural, social, and individual. Both the enduring threat of COVID-19 infection and the protective measures to contain contagion have important consequences on individual mental health. These consequences, together with possible remedial interventions, are the focus of this article.

"Psychological distress, social support, and family satisfaction among family members of non-COVID-19 critical care patients: A cross-sectional study","This study aims to explore the associations among psychological distress, perceived social support, and family satisfaction among family members of non-COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study. Family members of patients with at least 48Ã‚Â h in the ICU and without a COVID-19 diagnosis were screened between January and March 2021. For enrolled ICU family members, five questionnaires for perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorder-7), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), perceived social support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey), and family satisfaction (Family Satisfaction with Care in the Intensive Care Unit-24) were administered by phone either in English or Spanish language. Sociodemographic and patient clinical data were also collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlations, Mann-Whitney U, and Fisher's exact tests. Of 87 eligible ICU family members, 63 were enrolled (72.4%); 27% of the sample presented with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, 25.4% with depression, and 76.2% had a high perception of social support. ICU family members with low/fair perceived social support reported statistically significantly higher perceived stress and lower family satisfaction. Perceived stress was negatively correlated with family satisfaction. Clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression were not statistically associated with family satisfaction or perceived social support. While ICU admission-related stress may undermine family satisfaction, perceived social support may be positively associated with the way that ICU family members of non-COVID-19 patients evaluate the quality of care in the ICU. Knowing the factors that influence family satisfaction in the ICU may assist stakeholders and policy developers to improve family-centered care in the hospital setting. Early screening for psychological distress and social support levels during admission should be included in updates of visiting and communication policies in the ICU. Prompt identification of family members at risk of a poor ICU experience may enhance efforts to support them, particularly in acute care settings where differentiated approaches to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU family members are established.","Padilla-Fortunatti, Munro, Gattamorta","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12812","20220929","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; family; intensive care units; nursing; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38505,""
"Expanding Access to Naloxone: A Necessary Step to Curb the Opioid Epidemic","The COVID-19 Pandemic has exacerbated the already worsening opioid epidemic within the United States. With a continuing increase in opioid overdose deaths, measures are needed to halt the needless number of deaths and begin on a path of recovery to address all the factors that impact the epidemic. The CDC has provided various recommendations to combat the increases in opioid overdose deaths. These recommendations have included expanded distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education as essential services for people most at risk of overdose. While strategies should include the increase in community resources for those with opioid disorder and shifting the perspectives of healthcare to view opioid disorder as a chronic illness that can be treated with medication such as buprenorphine, these methods are not immediate enough to stop the trend in deaths. The United States must take immediate action to expand access to and use of Naloxone for the public and first responders. Naloxone alone cannot address the magnitude of this epidemic, but it is an essential first step in preventing immediate death while a multimodal strategy is enacted to fully protect those most at risk.","Houser","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.199","20220929","community health planning; epidemics; health policy; public health practice; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38506,""
"Vitamin D Deficiency and Depression in Thai Medical Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-Sectional Study","Vitamin D deficiency is associated with osteoporosis, cancer, and autoimmune disease; evidence on its association with depression remains controversial. During the COVID-19 pandemic, preventive measures lead to reduced outdoor time and sunlight exposure, which is the major source of vitamin D. This study aims to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Thai medical students during the pandemic and to determine its association with depression. Medical students of year 4 and year 5 rotating in the Srinakharinwirot University Hospital who had no diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency and had not taken vitamin D supplement in the past year were invited to participate. Their total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were assessed with ELISA. Their demographic data were recorded, including age, sex, family income, class year, grade point average, current and history of psychiatrist-diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, other underlying diseases, and perceived difficulties in academic, relationship, substance use, and social supports. Students' depressive symptoms were assessed using the Thai version of Patient Health Questionnaire-adolescent (PHQ-A). A total of 63 female and 36 male medical students participated. 47.5% were year 4 and 52.5% were year 5. The mean vitamin D level was 21.7 ng/mL. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic was 52.6% (using the cut-off of &lt;20 ng/mL) or 69.5% (using the cut-off of &lt;30 ng/mL). The mean vitamin D level in year 4 students was significantly lower than that in year 5 students (12.2 vs 30.2 ng/mL, t = -10.00, p &lt; 0.01). Vitamin D level was associated with age (<i>r</i> = 0.38, p &lt; 0.01) and sex (marginally) [t = -1.80, p = 0.07]. In linear regression analysis, vitamin D level remained associated with the year of class after adjusting for age and sex (B = 18.67, p &lt; 0.01). The mean PHQ-A score was 5.8. 16 participants were identified to have depression. Vitamin D level was not correlated with PHQ-A score (<i>r</i> = 0.03, p = 0.80). In stepwise regression analysis, only total perceived difficulties score remained a predictor for PHQ-A score. In linear regression analysis, vitamin D level was not associated with PHQ-A score after adjusting for total perceived difficulties score (B = -0.02, p = 0.46). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in Thai medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic was high (52.6% or 69.5%), probably owing to a lack of sunlight exposure. Nonetheless, vitamin D level was not associated with depressive symptoms, probably owing to the small sample size or delayed onset of depressive symptoms.","Anuroj","https://doi.org/10.12809/eaap2209","20220929","COVID-19; Depression; Students, medical; Vitamin D deficiency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38507,""

"The relationship between religious/spiritual well-being, psychiatric symptoms and addictive behaviors among young adults during the COVID-19-pandemic","It is becoming increasingly apparent that the COVID-19 pandemic not only poses risks to physical health, but that it also might lead to a global mental health crisis, making the exploration of protective factors for mental well-being highly relevant. The present study seeks to investigate religious/spiritual well-being (RSWB) as a potential protective factor with regard to psychiatric symptom burden and addictive behavior. The data was collected by conducting an online survey in the interim period between two national lockdowns with young adults (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°306; age: 18-35) in Austria. The primary study variables were assessed through the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18; psychiatric symptom load), the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST; addictive behavior/addiction risk) and the Multidimensional Inventory for Religious/Spiritual Well-Being short version (MI-RSWB 12), with its sub-dimensions Hope (HO), Forgiveness (FO), General Religiosity (GR), and Connectedness (CO). We observed HO and FO as substantial negative predictors of psychiatric symptom burden. With regard to addictive behavior, HO in particular but also GR seem to have a protective function. Furthermore, we found positive connections between CO, psychiatric symptom burden, and addictive behavior. In line with our assumptions, HO, FO and to a minor extent GR were confirmed as negative predictors regarding psychiatric symptom burden or addictive behavior in young adults, coping with the psychological threat of COVID-19 pandemic. These dimensions might be further considered as potential resources in clinical treatment. However, the positive prediction of mental illness parameters by increased feelings of CO could also be interpreted as an expression of exhaustion and alienation from the real world.","Vuzic, Burkart, Wenzl, Fuchshuber, Unterrainer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.942149","20220929","COVID-19; addictive behavior; mental health; religious/spiritual well-being; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38509,""
"Brief report of protective factors associated with family and parental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in an outpatient child and adolescent psychiatric clinic","Families of children with mental health challenges may have been particularly vulnerable to emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study surveyed 81 parents of children ages 6-17 years receiving mental health treatment in an outpatient clinic during the pandemic. We sought to characterize the impact of the pandemic on family relationships and parental well-being. Additionally, regression and ANCOVA models examined associations between four potentially protective factors-parents' psychological resilience, perceived social support, positive family experiences during the pandemic, and children's use of cognitive or behavioral coping strategies-with family relationships and parental well-being. Findings suggest that families of children with mental health conditions experienced remarkable challenges to family relationships, parental well-being, and parents' perceived capacity to support their children's mental health. Nearly 80% of parents reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their own well-being, and 60% reported reduced ability to support their children's mental health. Simultaneously, protective factors appeared to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic. Particularly, support within the family (e.g., co-parenting) and from external sources (e.g., mental health services) were associated with better self-reported well-being for parents and their capacity to support their children. Children's use of coping tools, likely enhanced by mental health treatment, was also positively related to better family relationships and parental ability to support children with mental health challenges. Our findings highlight the need for enhancing supports for families at multiple levels including individual skill-building, family-based/parenting support, and community-based support.","Urban, Friedman, Kaskas, Caruso, Canenguez, Rotter, Wozniak, Basu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.883955","20220929","COVID-19 pandemic; child and adolescent mental health; cognitive behavioral tools; parental wellbeing; protective factors; resilience, family functioning; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38510,""
"Mind the gap: Identifying training needs of community health workers to address mental health in US Latino communities during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic","Addressing mental health is an important part of the COVID-19 response among historically underserved communities, which have been disproportionately affected. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are well placed to offer insights about barriers to mental health service use in their communities, and they are well positioned to address mental health gaps by providing education, resources, and assistance to bridging the gap for the use of more traditional mental health services. Using the perspectives of CHWs, this project identified barriers faced by CHWs in assisting community members with their mental health needs, along with relevant training needs to more effectively deliver mental health resources, referrals, and recommendations to community members. Survey data along with data from focus groups were collected among 43 CHWs in communities that have been historically underserved near the U.S.-Mexico border region. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics whereas qualitative data were analyzed through systematic methods. Identified barriers to assisting community members with their mental health needs exist at the personal, community, environmental and organizational levels, and ranged from fear and mistrust to limited services, resources, funding and training opportunities. To help address the aforementioned barriers and facilitate access to mental health service use in their communities, CHWs identified and described opportunities for training in core areas including communication, mental illness symptom identification, trauma, self-care and stress reduction, and cultural awareness and sensitivity. Needs-based training programs that incorporate the insights of CHWs are a crucial part of promoting community-based mental health to address existing mental health disparities in access to and use of mental health services.","Garcini, Kanzler, Daly, Abraham, Hernandez, Romero, Rosenfeld","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.928575","20220929","COVID-19; Latino; community health workers; mental health; stress; training; underserved and unserved populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38511,""
"Association between COVID-19 Risk-Mitigation Behaviors and Specific Mental Disorders in Youth","<b>Background</b> : Although studies of adults show that pre-existing mental disorders increase risk for COVID-19 infection and severity, there is limited information about this association among youth. Mental disorders in general as well as specific types of disorders may influence their ability to comply with risk-mitigation strategies to reduce COVID-19 infection and transmission. <b>Methods</b> : Youth compliance (rated as ""Never,"" ""Sometimes,"" ""Often,"" or ""Very often/Always"") with risk mitigation was reported by parents on the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) in January 2021. Responses were summarized using factor analysis of risk mitigation, and their associations with lifetime mental disorders (assessed via structured diagnostic interviews) were identified with linear regression analyses (adjusted for covariates). All analyses used R Project for Statistical Computing for Mac (v.4.0.5). <b>Results</b> : A two-factor model was the best-fitting solution. Factor 1 (avoidance behaviors) included avoiding groups, indoor settings, and other peoples' homes; avoidance was more likely among youth with any anxiety disorder (p=.01). Factor 2 (hygiene behaviors) included using hand sanitizer, washing hands, and maintaining social distance; practicing hygiene was less likely among youth with ADHD (combined type) (p=.02). Mask wearing, which did not load on either factor, was not associated with any mental health disorder. <b>Conclusion and Relevance</b> : Findings suggest that education and monitoring of risk-mitigation strategies in certain subgroups of youth may reduce risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other contagious diseases. Additionally, they highlight the need for greater attention to vaccine prioritization for individuals with ADHD.","Conway, Bhardwaj, Michel, Paksarian, Nikolaidis, Kang, Merikangas, Milham","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2026969/v1","20220929","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38512,""
"Increase in Rate of Hospitalizations for Pediatric Intentional Acetaminophen Ingestion at a Single Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Social disruption due to COVID-19 has detrimentally affected American adolescents' emotional well-being. Within our system, pediatric acetaminophen ingestions increased in 2020, compared with previous years. We sought to evaluate the rate of hospitalizations for acetaminophen self-harm ingestions and self-harm of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified patients (aged 0-23) from billing data with diagnosis of acetaminophen ingestion with self-harm intent (ICD-10 code T391X2A), from a multicenter urban, quaternary health care system. We performed retrospective chart review from 2016 to 2020 and performed statistics using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression model. From 2016 to 2020, there were 25Ã¢â‚¬â€°790 discharges of adolescents with 65 acetaminophen self-harm ingestion and 148 self-harm discharges. Of the 65 acetaminophen patients, 75% identified as female and 54% identified as non-white; 71% with Medicaid insurance. The proportion of acetaminophen ingestion and self-harm admissions increased from 0.13% in 2016 to 0.46% by 2020 and 0.42% in 2016 to 0.73% by 2020, respectively. The odds of acetaminophen ingestion admission increased by 28% each additional year (odds ratio = 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.53; <i>P</i> = .006). There was not enough evidence to conclude that the log-odds of a self-harm ingestion were linearly related to time (<i>P</i> = .06). Acetaminophen ingestion for self-harm has significantly increased, while overall self-harm has increased to a lesser, nonsignificant degree. Primarily females of color and those with Medicaid insurance are affected. It is important to note this growing, disturbing trend, and to continue to screen for depression in our adolescent community and ensure access to mental health resources.","Moss, Hertzberg, Person, Stoffels, Zackai, Bucuvalas, Gillen","https://doi.org/10.1177/00099228221124680","20220929","Acetaminophen; COVID-19; ingestion; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38513,""
"The realities and expectations of community involvement in COVID-19 research: a Consumer Reference Group perspective","Older adults have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 restrictions such as stay at home orders and physical distancing measures have been implemented to reduce older adults' risk of infection, however, such measures can have negative effects on older adults' mental health and social wellbeing. In 2020, the research team received funding as part of an Australian COVID-19 research grants program to investigate how services can better meet the mental health and social support needs of older adults during COVID-19. A Consumer Reference Group (CRG) was established to provide a community perspective on all research activities. The CRG comprised of eight older adults aged 65Ã‚Â years and older living in Western Australia. Two members of the CRG were involved in the initial grant proposal, and one member worked for a not-for-profit organisation that provides support and advocacy for older adults. The CRGs role was to provide consumer and community perspectives on the research design, advise on study materials, facilitate links between consumers, the community, and researchers, and advocate on behalf of consumers and the community. The CRG was encouraged to reflect on the research project, their contributions, and the outcomes obtained. In this commentary, we document the CRGs contributions to the project, and record their reflections, including what went well, what were some challenges, the realities of conducting research during COVID-19, and lessons learnt. The CRG were active participants in the research process. They shared their perspectives and made important contributions to the project. Through collaboration with the CRG, we were able to reach four key messages, underpinned by consumers lived experiences, that were used to co-develop knowledge translation products. These were disseminated to service providers and older adults. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, health and social measures have been introduced to reduce the spread of the virus, including lockdowns, physical distancing, and mask mandates. Older adults (aged 60Ã‚Â years and older) are considered particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and have therefore facedÃ‚Â some of the greatest restrictions to reduce their risk of infection. These restrictions can have a negative effect on older adults social and emotional wellbeing. In 2020 the research team received funding to investigate how services could better meet the mental health and social support needs of older Australians during the pandemic. To enable a community perspective on all research activities, a Consumer Reference Group (CRG) of eight older adults living in Western Australia was established. Two of the eight CRG members were involved in the initial grant proposal. The CRGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role was to share their thoughts on the research design, study materials, and to provide links to and advocate for consumers and the community. This commentary reports reflections from the CRC on what went well, what some of the challenges were, the realities of conducting this research during COVID-19, and what lessons were learnt. Through collaboration with the CRG key messages for the research project were reached and used to inform infographics, which were then disseminated to inform service delivery providers and older adults of the research outcomes.","Adams, Albert, Benson, Cordingley, Daniels, Fynn, Gurgone, Jeffery, White, Strobel","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-022-00389-z","20220928","COVID-19; Consumer involvement; Consumer perspectives; Health services research; Older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38514,""
"Levels of depressive symptoms in cardiac patients attending cardiac rehabilitation with a history of depression: pre Covid-19 and Covid-19 period comparison","The large-scale changes in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme delivery in response to COVID-19 has led to diminished provision. The influence of these service changes on the depression symptoms of patients in CR programmes is unknown. Our study investigated the extent of depressive symptoms prior to and during the COVID-19 periods in patients with a previous history of depression at the start of CR. Use of Registry routine practice data, National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation (NACR), from COVID-19 period Feb 2020 and Jan 2021, as well as pre COVID-19 period Feb 2019 and Jan 2020, was extracted. Depressive symptoms were defined according to Hospital Anxiety and Depression ScoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°8. Chi-square tests and independent samples t-tests were used to investigate baseline characteristics. Additionally, a binary logistic regression to examine the factors associated with high levels of depressive symptoms. In total 3661 patients with a history of depression were included in the analysis. Patients attending CR during COVID-19 were found to be 11% more likely to have high levels of acute depressive symptoms compared to patients attending CR prior to COVID-19. Physical inactivity, increased anxiety, a higher total number of comorbidities, increased weight, and living in the most deprived areas were statistically significant factors associated with high levels of acute depressive symptoms at the start of CR following multivariate adjustments. Our research suggests that following a cardiac event patients with prior history of depression have high levels of acute depressive symptoms at CR baseline assessment. This finding exists in both the pre Covid-19 and Covid-19 periods in patients with a history of depression.","Sever, Harrison, Doherty","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-022-02867-4","20220928","Acute depressive symptoms; COVID-19; Cardiac rehabilitation; Cardiovascular disease; History of depression; Observational study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38515,""
"Virtual Reality-Based Interventions for Treating Depression in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic: Inducing the Proficit in Positive Emotions as a Key Concept of Recovery and a Path Back to Normality","During the COVID-19 pandemic as much as 40% of the global population reported deterioration in depressive mood, whereas 26% experienced increased need for emotional support. At the same time, the availability of on-site psychiatric care declined drastically because of the COVID-19 preventive social restriction measures. To address this shortfall, telepsychiatry assumes a greater role in mental health care services. Among various on-line treatment modalities, immersive virtual reality (VR) environments provide an important resource for adjusting the emotional state in people living with depression. Therefore, we reviewed the literature on VR-based interventions for depression treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases, as well as the Internet, for full-length articles published during the period of 2020-2022 citing a set of following key words: ""virtual reality"", ""depression"", ""COVID-19"", as well as their terminological synonyms and word combinations. The inclusion criteria were: 1) the primary or secondary study objectives included the treatment of depressive states or symptoms; 2) the immersive VR intervention used a head-mounted display (HMD); 3) the article presented clinical study results and/or case reports 4) the study was urged by or took place during the COVID-19-associated lockdown period. Overall, 904 records were retrieved using the search strategy. Remarkably, only three studies and one case report satisfied all the inclusion criteria elaborated for the review. These studies included 155 participants: representatives of healthy population (n=40), a case report of a patient with major depressive disorder (n=1), patients with cognitive impairments (n=25), and COVID-19 patients who had survived from ICU treatment (n=89). The described interventions used immersive VR scenarios, in combination with other treatment techniques, and targeted depression. The most robust effect, which the VR-based approach had demonstrated, was an immediate post-intervention improvement in mood and the reduction of depressive symptoms in healthy population. However, studies showed no significant findings in relation to both short-term effectiveness in treatment of depression and primary prevention of depressive symptoms. Also, safety issues were identified, such as: three participants developed mild adverse events (e.g., headache, ""giddiness"", and VR misuse behavior), and three cases of discomfort related to wearing a VR device were registered. There has been a lack of appropriately designed clinical trials of the VR-based interventions for depression since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, all these studies had substantial limitations due to the imprecise study design, small sample size, and minor safety issues, that did not allow us making meaningful judgments and conclude regarding the efficacy of VR in the treatment of depression, taking into account those investigations we have retrieved upon the inclusion criteria of our particularistic review design. This may call for randomized, prospective studies of the short-term and long-lasting effect of VR modalities in managing negative affectivity (sadness, anxiety, anhedonia, self-guilt, ignorance) and inducing positive affectivity (feeling of happiness, joy, motivation, self-confidence, viability) in patients suffering from clinical depression.","Borisova, Moore, Sira Mahalingappa, Cumming, Dave, Abraham, Ramkisson, Tavormina, Kolsanov, Chaplygin, Kozina, Vlasov, Smirnova, Syunyakov","https://www.google.com/search?q=Virtual+Reality-Based+Interventions+for+Treating+Depression+in+the+Context+of+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Inducing+the+Proficit+in+Positive+Emotions+as+a+Key+Concept+of+Recovery+and+a+Path+Back+to+Normality.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38516,""

"Anxiety, Depression and Suicidality in Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Russian Study Sample of the COMET-G Project","During the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare workers have been under pressure of high workload and an increased risk of contracting the SARS-Cov-2 virus, while confronting the most tragic and devastating aspects of the pandemic-related medical realities. These factors could lead to severe distress with potential consequences for productivity in performing professional duties, and substantially increased risk for affective reactions, including clinical states of anxiety, depression and suicidality as compared to the general population. Thus, we aimed to investigate the changes in rates of anxiety, depression and suicidality in response to the pandemic among medical staff as compared to a sample of the general population and to the period of prepandemic time. This study is part of the large-scale, international multicentre COMET-G project. We assessed the extents of anxiety, depression and suicidality risks using the Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) with a cut-off score 39/40, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) with a cut-off score 23/24, and the Risk Assessment Suicidality Scale (RASS) with a cut-off score 499/500, respectively, in samples of Russian healthcare workers and the general population. Among 7777 respondents participating in the study, responses to a query about occupation indicated 1216 healthcare workers. 45.8% of medical staff vs 40.4% of non-medical staff (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=12.42, p&lt;0.001) reported the increased anxiety, in excess of the clinical anxiety state threshold score of 39 according to the STAI. High suicidality risks, according to a RASS score &gt; 500, were reported by 8.2% of medical professionals vs 10.6% of non-medical personnel (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>=6.35, p=0.012). The increase in depression rates, including cases of clinical depression according to the threshold of CES-D Ã¢â€°Â¥ 24, did not differ between the groups. A larger proportion of healthcare system staff, as compared to the general population, reported a significant increase in anxiety in response to the pandemic. Compared to medical doctors, other healthcare system workers had a significantly higher prevalence of depression and suicidality rates. Exploratory analysis suggested that it was not the occupation per se, but rather the burden of meaningful working duties that could be associated with psychological defense mechanisms against depression and suicidality among medical staff.","Smirnova, Syunyakov, Pavlichenko, Morozov, Nasyrova, Asadullin, Fedotov, Filatova, Sloeva, Ignatenko, Pozharsky, Romanov, Spikina, Yashikhina, Gonda, Fountoulakis","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety,+Depression+and+Suicidality+in+Healthcare+Workers+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+The+Russian+Study+Sample+of+the+COMET-G+Project.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38518,""

A range of neurological (e.g., brain fog, encephalitis, myalgia) and psychiatric (e.g., affective disorders, delirium, cognitive disturbances) complications of a novel nature have been observed in patients during the acute phase of illness, which often persist as a Long-COVID state for months after the primary recovery. The pandemic has progressed to a psychodemic and syndemic, affecting communities with social distress, panic, fears, increased home violence, and protest movements that derive from conspiracy theories and hostile attitudes towards vaccination and lockdown measures. In response to this complex scenario of major social changes, universities must face the need to equip the new generation of doctors with novel special skills. The study course (50 hours duration; 20 lectures, three webinars, three e-discussion forums, five local seminars, two social events, three intermediate assessments and a final test for certification; bilingual Russian/English hybrid format, information materials, video-content, interactive web-page and social media) was developed by the team of the International Centre for Education and Research in Neuropsychiatry (ICERN), and is unique for the EU. The course integrates the most relevant data on SARS-Cov-2-related neuropsychiatry, and COVID-19' pandemic impact on mental health and society, including assignment of the vulnerable groups of students and healthcare professionals. The major topics covered during the course are (i) Novel virus, (ii) Brain, (iii) Society. The project takes place originally in Samara State Medical University. The ICERN Faculty includes academic staff from France, Hungary, Italy, Russia, Switzerland, invited speakers from the WHO Regional Office for Europe and World Psychiatric Association (EU Zones) members, some of them employed at ICERN by remote work contracts. The format of the educational process for students is hybrid suggesting both remote and face-to-face events. Distant learning participants and EU lecturers are to attend on-line via zoom platform, whereas local participants and staff work face-to-face in the ICERN video-conference room. The course is addressed to a broad audience of doctors, undergraduate and postgraduate students, and researchers from EU wishing to upgrade their knowledge in the pandemic-associated neuropsychiatry. The evaluation process supposes three intermediate assessments and a final test for certification. On-line assessment is to be performed at the project web-page - 10 randomly selected questions with scoring from 1 to 10 each. The Pass Score is 70-100. At the end of the course all the participants receive certificates of Samara State Medical University according to the ERASMUS policy book, as planned in 2021. We formatted this course as essential for the target audience to improve their resources of professional adaptability in the field of neuropsychiatry and mental healthcare management during challenging times. The ICERN course in pandemic-related neuropsychiatry is essential for early career health professionals and targets the principles of ""academia without borders"" in the context of international medical knowledge exchange. In the conditions of the changing social situation this educational content is necessary for the young doctors to acquire the add-on skills on flexibility to switch toward new professional approaches in the times of need. The long-term outcomes in pandemic-related neuropsychiatry are still to be seen, though the first feedback on the course content is already promising for the academic community.","Kozina, Gonda, Thibaut, Tavormina, Borisova, Gorbatchev, Protasov, Kolsanov, Smirnova","https://www.google.com/search?q=Educational+Initiative+about+the+COVID-19+Pandemic-Related+Neuropsychiatry+for+Early+Career+Professionals+in+EU:+The+Impact+of+the+Novel+Virus+on+Brain,+Mind,+and+Society.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38520,""
"Depression, Self-Harm, Suicide A Longitudinal Descriptive Study after the COVID 19 Pandemic in the Province of Trento","The sudden and unexpected spread of the COVID 19 pandemic forced the political and health institutions of many countries to adopt drastic measures to contain the contagion, forcing millions of people into isolation and loneliness since 2020. For this reason, health organizations were committed from the beginning to develop all strategies available to support the mental health of the community and to reduce the risks of a rising suicide rate. Although an apparent ""protective"" role of emergency interventions on suicidal behavior was confirmed during the first months of forced isolation of the population, in the following months a close correlation was highlighted between pandemic period, rising of psychological and psychiatric disorders, and suicidal ideation. The increased suicide rate in Trentino in the first half of 2022 was not unexpected.Beyond the possible increase in suicide rates, a sustained and chronic increase in suicidal risk, suicidal ideation and in self harm could be confirmed in the future. The implementation of successful strategies for reducing suicidal deaths is a public health issue and will lay on the availability of local prevention projects, on their effort to better understand suicide and suicidal behaviors during outbreak, in order to develop the general capacity to early identify risk situation, and to enhance the effectiveness of prevention plans.","Di Napoli","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression,+Self-Harm,+Suicide.+A+Longitudinal+Descriptive+Study+after+the+COVID+19+Pandemic+in+the+Province+of+Trento.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38521,""
"The Place of Care under Constraint for Mood Disorders in the Context of the Collapse of the Supply of Psychiatric Care during the COVID-19 Crisis","In March 2020, the Belgian population was exposed to a confinement situation that it had never experienced before associated with the collapse in access to psychiatric care. Initially, only emergencies and constrained care continued to operate. In these specific circumstances, where both the overall population and the psychiatric population, was exposed to unique stress factors, what was the role of forced psychiatric internments in the treatment of mood disorders? We have measured the number of detentions for observation with and without suicide attempt over the two years prior to the pandemic in order to obtain theoretical reference values. We have compared these values with the measures over the 12 months following the start of the confinement period, which constitute the Crisis values. The continuation of measures, with an equal number of observation measures, constituted the Post-Crisis values. For these same cases, we compared in suicide attempt cases, whether the criteria for Severe Major Depressive Disorder were met or not. Lastly we compared the number of observation measures that were lifted, or not, within ten days of patient care. There was no significant increase in Detentions for Observation following a suicide attempt during the Crisis period. However a significant increase was observed during the Post-Crisis period. As regards cases of attempted suicide during the Crisis period, the number of patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorders reduced significantly in terms of statistics. This confirms our impression of a change in population. The Post-Crisis values dropped to the Theoric values. The number of Observation measures lifted increased quite significantly during the Crisis period, while there was a return to values in terms of statistics similar to the Theoric values during the Post-Crisis period. Although the population, both the healthy population and those suffering from a psychiatric condition, was subject to stress that it had never before experienced coinciding with a collapse of healthcare provision, there was no increase in patients meeting the criteria to benefit from constrained care during the Crisis period. On the other hand, there was a significant change in statistical terms in the population of patients who attempted suicide. We have seen a collapse in the number of patients suffering from depressive disorders and an equivalent increase in the number of patients with personality disorders or adjustment disorders. The number of Observation measures lifted during the Crisis period also grew quite significantly. Constrained care was available to help manage reactive suicide attempts. All other things being equal, they indirectly showed a reduction in Major Depressive Disorders requiring constrained care in the population.","Llano Lopez, San Sebastian, Tecco","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Place+of+Care+under+Constraint+for+Mood+Disorders+in+the+Context+of+the+Collapse+of+the+Supply+of+Psychiatric+Care+during+the+COVID-19+Crisis.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38522,""
"Association between Lifestyle- and Circadian Rhythm-Related Changes, and Different Depression Symptom Clusters during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic brought along a new situation for the population worldwide. The most important safety measures and lockdown expected extreme adaptability and flexibility impacting mental well-being. The aim of our study was to identify associations between changes in lifestyle and circadian rhythm and depression during the pandemic. Our analysis has been carried out on the Hungarian data set of the COMET-G study including information on lifestyle and circadian rhythm-associated factors and severity of depression and its 3 symptom clusters. Associations were assessed using linear regression models adjusted for age and sex. All variables reflecting changes in quality and quantity of sleep showed significant associations with overall depression scores and the three distinct symptom cluster scores. All variables reflecting importance and changes in physical activity during the pandemic were similarly significantly associated with all depression measures. However, only changes in quality of diet, but not quantity was associated with depression scores. Our results may confirm the association of circadian rhythm and lifestyle-related environmental factors in deterioration of mental health during COVID and help devise prevention and intervention methods and targets for similar situations.","Vadon, Elek, Szigeti, Erdelyi-Hamza, Smirnova, Fountoulakis, Gonda","https://www.google.com/search?q=Association+between+Lifestyle-+and+Circadian+Rhythm-Related+Changes,+and+Different+Depression+Symptom+Clusters+during+COVID-19.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38523,""
"Depression in Early Childhood","According to data from the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an increase in anxiety and depression around the world. In particular, there has been an increase in Depressive Disorder in childhood: the closure of childcare centers has caused great stress in parents, especially in mothers who have developed more depressive disorders. Maternal depression appears to have created problematic behaviors in preschool children. This phenomenon is explained by several studies that over the years have shown that a good mother-child interaction is essential for the child's psychophysical health and that interactions with depressed mothers have caused depression in children already in early childhood. The purpose of this work is a review of the scientific literature, from 1927 to 2022, on depression in early childhood, from 0 to 5 years of age. Research has been carried out on Medline PubMed, Google Scholar and specialist scientific journals of psychiatry, psychology and child neuropsychiatry, using the following keywords: infant depression, anaclitic depression, hospitalism, early chilhood depression, depressive position, attachement and mother-infant dyad. The depressive illness of the mother, the lack of care, attention and stimulation to the vocalizations of the young child can induce negative reactions in the relationship between mother and child. Early identification and treatment of perinatal depression is critical to ensuring the child's optimal development and future mental health. In addition to maternal depression there are also other factors that can generate depression in the child as well as a prolonged separation from her. The authors' conclusions are that it is essential to train and inform educators and family members on depression in childhood to allow for the recognition of the child's suffering and for it to be examined by the doctor. It is important an early intervention both on the family and on the child to avoid relapses, chronicity and any serious damage.","Tavormina, Tavormina","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression+in+Early+Childhood.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38524,""
"Hope in Psychiatric Patients: An Observational Study in a Psychiatric Rehabilitation Centre","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the re-evaluation of some fundamental aspects for the management of emotions and psychological dynamics. Hope and its lack are important factors that have been especially evaluated in caregivers and HCWs. Instead, our study aimed to explore hopelessness among psychiatric rehabilitation center residents with Primary Psychosis. We recruited 116 inpatients affected by Primary Psychosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression disorder and personality disorder). Hopelessness was sought through the BHS, during the covid-19 pandemic period. They were compared with data from previous studies on HCWs (HealthCare Workers), in the same period, and in the same centre. The results obtained in this group of patients showed high total scores on the BHS scale (mean total score: 7.28Ã‚Â±SD 3.73). These data are significantly higher than those found in HWs in the same pandemic period (mean total score: 3.74Ã‚Â±SD 3.62). Among the different disorders the borderline personality disorder patients have presented the highest score (mean total score: 8.00Ã‚Â±SD 3.50).

"First Episode Psychosis Following COVID-19 Vaccination: a Case Report","Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.","Renemane, Vrublevska, Cera","https://www.google.com/search?q=First+Episode+Psychosis+Following+COVID-19+Vaccination:+a+Case+Report.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38526,""

Seven sample classes were selected for which a questionnaire was specifically designed, the students (male and female) were between the ages of 14 and 18. From the results of the questionnaire and the clinical observation, a part of the students show mood disorders with depression type symptoms, attention and concentration difficulties, decrease in academic performance, difficulty in managing emotions, irritability, behavioural fidgeting, displays of anxiety. Furthermore, the individual listening desk was set up to which all the students at the school had access. The primary objective of the project was that of improving emotional, relationship and behavioural issues. Several methodologies were used, such as: participant observation, brainstorming, psychoeducation, active listening, communicative feedback, reactivation of resources. From the active listening carried out in group and individually, the emotional awareness triggered an improvement in the ability to manage emotions in the student, reactivating their own personal resources and improving mood.","Costa, Tavormina","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Listening+Experience+in+a+Group+of+Adolescents+with+Mood+Disorders.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38527,""
"Possible Clinical and Pharmacogenetic Predictors of the Efficacy and Safety of Carbamazepine in Post-COVID-19 Depression","Individuals who have suffered from novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are at risk for developing post-COVID neuropsychiatric disorders, which are an integral part of the Long COVID syndrome. Depression and/or anxiety are considered the most common psychiatric disorders after experiencing COVID-19. Certain antiepileptic drugs, notably, carbamazepine (CMZ), are effective in the treatment of mood disorders, especially as mood stabilizers in bipolar affective disorder (BAD), but the efficacy of CMZ in Long COVID remains to be established. The aim of the review was to investigate pharmacogenetic predictors of safety and efficacy of CMZ in patients with depressive symptoms of Long COVID during the post-infection period. We carried out a systematic search for publications in English and Russian on the safety and efficacy of CMZ in depressive disorders of different etiologies in the PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Clinical Keys, Google Schooler, E-Library databases using keywords and combined word searches (carbamazepine, COVID-19, depression, epilepsy, post-COVID-syndrome) for the period from January 01,2020 to June 10, 2022. We review the main adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with CMZ, drug-drug interactions, and genetic predictors of the development of ADR. Here, we consider as risk factors, candidate genes for CMZ metabolism, CMZ transport, immunohistocompatibility genes, and candidate genes for QT prolongation. The choice of antidepressant treatment for patients with Long COVID is fraught because of the frequent occurrence of subclinical (interictal) epileptiform activity in the EEG. Consequently, antidepressant medications with a proconvulsant effect are contraindicated for Long COVID patients. CMZ may be a promising alternative for the treatment of depressive disorders in Long COVID states, given its mood-stabilizer, antidepressant, and antiepileptic profile.","Vaiman, Gayduk, Strelnik, Smirnova, Davydkin, Fedyashov, Cumming, Shnayder, Nasyrova","https://www.google.com/search?q=Possible+Clinical+and+Pharmacogenetic+Predictors+of+the+Efficacy+and+Safety+of+Carbamazepine+in+Post-COVID-19+Depression.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38528,""
"Pharmacogenetic Aspects of COVID-19 Management and Post-COVID-19 Depression Treatment with Fluvoxamine","Quarantine measures with self-isolation of varying duration have been significant psychosocial stressors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine has been considered as a prophylaxis against depression in early COVID-19 patients, with additional benefits apparently arising from its antiviral activity. In this narrative review, we draw attention to the body of evidence showing efficacy of fluvoxamine in protecting against depressive disorders in COVID-19 patients, while also attenuating the severity of COVID-19 disease, with a notable reduction in the need for intubation and lower mortality. We consider this potential two-fold action of fluvoxamine in the light of its pharmacogenetic and pharmacological profiles. Full-text publications in English and Russian in Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, Web of Science, and E-Library databases were selected by keywords, solitary and in combination (fluvoxamine, COVID-19, depression, anxiety, antidepressants, adverse reactions) for the period from March 01, 2020 to June 06, 2022. We also analyzed the full-text publications in English and Russian language reporting adverse reactions caused by fluvoxamine use for the period from 2012 to 2022. The literature search yielded 10 papers reporting on the efficacy fluvoxamine in relieving depressive symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and 3 papers on its effect on medical outcome. The preponderance of data indicated a dual therapeutic action of fluvoxamine, and our further literature investigation was informative about drug-drug interactions and genetic factors moderating the antidepressant efficacy of fluvoxamine. Patients with COVID-19 seeking psychopharmacological treatment for depressive symptoms must be informed of the benefits and risks of fluvoxamine use. Several lines of findings indicate this agent to possess an additional antiviral action. However, optimal dosage regimens and the trade-off with drug-drug interactions remain unclear. Pharmacogenetic testing may assist in evidence-based optimization of fluvoxamine dosages in the context of COVID-19 infection with comorbid depression.","Dobrodeeva, Abdyrahmanova, Astafeva, Smirnova, Cumming, De Sousa, Davydkin, Yashikhina, Shnayder, Nasyrova","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pharmacogenetic+Aspects+of+COVID-19+Management+and+Post-COVID-19+Depression+Treatment+with+Fluvoxamine.","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38529,""
"Depression during COVID-19 Pandemic: is There an Emergency?","As attention is currently focused on the urgent need to address the impacts of the social isolation measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health, this study aims to determine whether the reported malaise and depression among this population is directly related to the pandemic. We conducted an analysis of the review of the literature based on content in the leading medical databases, and reviewed empirical data regarding the number of psychiatric consultations, and markers of anxiety and depression in adolescents. Social isolation has clearly had a negative impact on adolescent mental health. However, while adolescent psychiatric consultations, and markers of anxiety and depression have increased, this increase has been present for many years. It is therefore difficult to establish a causal link between the two. Our results suggest that adolescent mental health is an important problem that needs to be addressed as a priority, while care needs to continue even after social isolation measures have been lifted.","Guerfali, Zdanowicz","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression+during+COVID-19+Pandemic:+is+There+an+Emergency?","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38530,""
"A Comparative Study Measuring the Difference of Healthcare Workers Reactions Among Those Involved in a Patent Safety Incident and Healthcare Professionals While Working During COVID-19","This study aimed to describe the differences and similarities in the reaction of the healthcare worker involved in a patient safety incident or during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also compared the differences in support they need. A secondary data analysis was performed based on 2 cross-sectional survey studies. One study evaluated the impact of patient safety incidents on healthcare professionals, and the other evaluated the impact of COVID-19. Measurements on mental health reactions and an evaluation of the experienced support system were compared between 883 doctors and 1970 nurses working in different hospitals. Anxiety, difficulties concentrating, doubting knowledge and skills, feeling on their own, feeling unhappy and dejected, feeling uncertain in team, flashbacks, hypervigilance, sleep deprivation, stress and wanting to quit profession were statistically higher in the COVID-19-related groups. Second victims tend to speak about it with their own/close colleagues, whereas healthcare workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic talk more often to their partner and friends. Only a small number talked to a psychologist, but the number who needed to talk to a psychologist but did not is higher than the number who did talk to a psychologist or used professional support in all 5 groups. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers is larger than after being involved in a patient safety incident. There is the need for an adequate support system, and the mental health of all healthcare workers needs to be considered.

"Transgender and non-binary people's preferences for virtual health care post-pandemic: A cross-sectional Canadian study","Virtual health care use has dramatically increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question of its potential role post-pandemic. For transgender and non-binary (TNB) people, virtual care is promising because it may expand access to health care providers who are affirming and competent to address TNB health needs. However, emerging research indicates potential disparities in virtual care access related to sociodemographic, health, and social factors. There is a paucity of research on the factors affecting patient preferences for virtual versus in-person care, particularly in TNB communities. This study aims to identify sociodemographic, health, and social factors associated with post-pandemic virtual care preferences in TNB communities. The 2020 Trans PULSE Canada COVID Survey examined health, social, and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among 820 TNB participants who previously completed the pre-pandemic 2019 Trans PULSE Canada survey (n=2783). Data were weighted to the demographics of the 2019 sample. Chi-square tests were used to compare post-pandemic preferences for virtual versus in-person care across sociodemographic, health, and social characteristics. Participants provided open-text responses explaining their preferences, which were used to contextualize the quantitative findings. Of 812 participants who indicated whether they would prefer virtual or in-person care post-pandemic, a weighted 32.7% (n=275) would prefer virtual care and 67.3% (n=537) would prefer in-person care. Preferences for in-person over virtual care were associated with being in the 14-19 (85.0%), 50-64 (80.0%), and 65+ (90.7%) age groups (Ãâ€¡25=19.0; P=.002). Preferences for virtual over in-person care were associated with having a chronic health condition (37.7% versus 29.9%; Ãâ€¡21=4.7; P=.03) and having probable anxiety (34.7% versus 25.7%; Ãâ€¡21=4.3; P=.04). Among participants with romantic partners, preferences varied based on the partner's level of support for gender identity or expression (Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â¬23=13.3; P=.004); participants with moderately supportive partners were more likely than participants with very supportive partners to prefer in-person care (85.1% versus 62.3%). Care preferences did not vary significantly based on indicators of socioeconomic status. Open-text responses showed that multiple factors often interacted to influence participant preferences, and that some factors such as having a chronic condition simultaneously led some participants to prefer virtual care and others to prefer in-person care. TNB people may have differential interest in virtual care based on factors including age, chronic and mental health conditions, and gender-unsupportive home environments. Future research examining virtual care preferences would benefit from mixed-methods intersectional approaches across these factors, to explore complexity in barriers and facilitators to virtual care access and quality. These observed differences support flexibility with options to choose between in-person and virtual modalities of health care to meet TNB patients' specific health needs.","Navarro, Scheim, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.2196/40989","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38532,""
"Moral injury and well-being in essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: local survey findings","Essential workers have faced many difficult situations working during the pandemic. Staff may feel that they, or other people, have acted wrongly and be distressed by this. This represents moral injury, which has been linked with significant mental ill health. This survey asked essential workers in County Durham and Darlington about their experiences during the first wave of the pandemic and anything they felt would help. Well-being and moral injury were rated using sliders. There were 566 responses. A majority of respondents reported feeling troubled by other people's actions they felt were wrong (60% scored over 40, where 0 is 'not at all troubled' and 100 'very troubled', median score=52.5). Respondents were generally less troubled by their own actions (median score=3). Well-being and moral injury scores varied by employment sector (eg, National Health Service (NHS) staff were more troubled by the actions of others than non-NHS staff).Staff suggestions included regular supervisor check-ins, ensuring kindness from everyone, fair rules and enforcement and improving communication and processes. Respondents offered simple, practical actions that could be taken by leaders at team, organisation, societal and governmental levels to tackle moral injury and the underlying causes of moral injurious environments. Using these findings to develop a strategy to address moral injury is important, not only for staff well-being, but staff retention and continued delivery of vital services in these challenging times. Working together, we can seek to reduce and mitigate 'moral injury' the same way we do for other physical workplace 'injuries'.","Guy, Kunonga, Kennedy, Patel","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2021-000518","20220928","COVID-19; analysis; clinical leadership; mental health; support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38533,""

As an essential technology powered by AI, natural language processing (NLP) plays a key role in smart healthcare due to its capability of analysing and understanding human language. In this work, we review existing studies that concern NLP for smart healthcare from the perspectives of technique and application. We first elaborate on different NLP approaches and the NLP pipeline for smart healthcare from the technical point of view. Then, in the context of smart healthcare applications employing NLP techniques, we introduce representative smart healthcare scenarios, including clinical practice, hospital management, personal care, public health, and drug development. We further discuss two specific medical issues, i.e., the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mental health, in which NLP-driven smart healthcare plays an important role. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current works and identify the directions for future works.","Zhou, Yang, Shi, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2022.3210270","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38534,""
"Hygienic behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic may decrease immunoglobulin G levels: Implications for Kawasaki disease","Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hygienic behaviors became a new norm since January 2020. The hygiene hypothesis predicts that an excessively hygienic environment may adversely affect human health. We quantified the effect of COVID-19 on immunological parameters linked to the hygiene hypothesis. We examined age-specific levels of total nonspecific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgE in individuals who visited Fukuoka Tokushukai Hospital between 2010 and 2021. Pre-COVID (2010-2019) and COVID (2020-2021) periods were compared. IgG levels steadily decreased throughout Pre-COVID period. IgG levels fell abruptly from the pre-COVID period to the COVID period in all age groups (P = 0.0271, &lt; 0.3 years; P = 0.0096, 0.3-5 years; P = 0.0074, Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5 years). The declines in IgG in &lt; 0.3 years and that in Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5 years accelerated during the COVID period. IgE levels were seasonal, but did not change noticeably from the pre-COVID to COVID period. IgG levels recorded for patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) (mean 709 mg/dL) were significantly lower than for matched control subjects (826 mg/dL) (P&lt;0.0001). Hygienic behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak decreased the chance of infection, which may explain the decreases in IgG levels in children and adults. Neonatal IgG declined, possibly because of the decrease in maternal IgG. Hygienic behaviors decreased the IgG levels in all age groups, from neonates to adults. This downturn in IgG may lead to vulnerability to infections as well as to KD.","Yamaguchi, Hirata, Hatakeyama, Yamane, Endo, Okubo, Nishimura, Nagao","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275295","20220929","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38535,""
"Observational study of the clinical performance of a public-private partnership national referral hospital network in Lesotho: Do improvements last over time?","Public-private partnerships (PPP) may increase healthcare quality but lack longitudinal evidence for success. The Queen 'Mamohato Memorial Hospital (QMMH) in Lesotho is one of Africa's first healthcare PPPs. We compare data from 2012 and 2018 on capacity, utilization, quality, and outcomes to understand if early documented successes have been sustained using the same measures over time. In this observational study using administrative and clinical data, we assessed beds, admissions, average length of stay (ALOS), outpatient visits, and patient outcomes. We measured triage time and crash cart stock through direct observation in 2013 and 2020. Operational hospital beds increased from 390 to 410. Admissions decreased (-5.3%) while outpatient visits increased (3.8%). ALOS increased from 5.1 to 6.5 days. Occupancy increased from 82% to 99%; half of the wards had occupancy rates Ã¢â€°Â¥90%, and Neonatal ward occupancy was 209%. The proportion of crash cart stock present (82.9% to 73.8%) and timely triage (84.0% to 27.6%) decreased. While overall mortality decreased (8.0% to 6.5%) and neonatal mortality overall decreased (18.0% to 16.3%), mortality among very low birth weight neonates increased (30.2% to 36.8%). Declines in overall hospital mortality are promising. Yet, continued high occupancy could compromise infection control and impede response to infections, such as COVID-19. High occupancy in the Neonatal ward suggests that the population need for neonatal care outpaces QMMH capacity; improvements should be addressed at the hospital and systemic levels. The increase in ALOS is acceptable for a hospital meant to take the most critical cases. The decline in crash cart stock completeness and timely triage may affect access to emergency treatment. While the partnership itself ended earlier than anticipated, our evaluation suggests that generally the hospital under the PPP was operational, providing high-level, critically needed services, and continued to improve patient outcomes. Quality at QMMH remained substantially higher than at the former Queen Elizabeth II hospital.","Scott, Kaiser, Jack, Nkabane-Nkholongo, Juntunen, Nash, Alade, Vian","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272568","20220929","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","",38536,""

"A Rule Mining and Bayesian Network Analysis to Explore the Link Between Depression and Digital Behavioral Markers of Games App Usage","Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, spending time on Games increased much which may have an impact on mental health. While numerous studies were conducted exploring the relation between Games and depression, none of the studies used objective Games app usage data which could provide unbiased and real-time insights. To fill this research gap, using our developed app that retrieves the past 7 daysâ€™ actual app usage data accurately, we conducted a study on Games app users (N=60) of Bangladesh. We extracted the behavioral markers from the foreground and background Games app usage eventsâ€™ data. To explore the relation between Games and depression, we mined rules, did correlation analysis, and built Bayesian networks. Our analyses demonstrated that the students who spent higher time and had a higher launch per Games app on weekends were more likely to be depressed (p<.05). In addition, from the Bayesian analysis, we found that while some usage data impacts depression, depression also impacts some usage behavior like frequency of launching Games apps. Apart from raising awareness about the negative impact of Games, insights from our study can facilitate the design of systems to improve the studentsâ€™ mental health.","Md.
