"Fertility intentions among couples in Shanghai under COVID-19: A cross-sectional study","To evaluate fertility intensions among couples in Shanghai under the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic against the backdrop of persistently low fertility. A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected regarding sociodemographic characteristics, history of reproduction and gynecology, fertility intention before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, female psychological state, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life. Under the influence of COVID-19, 296/447 (66.2%) participants did not change their original fertility intention to have children, while 151/447 (33.8%) of participants were affected by the outbreak. Participants who believed in government and hospital control policies were less likely to change their intention to become pregnant (P&lt;10<sup>-3</sup> , P&lt;10<sup>-3</sup> ). In contrast, concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on female and fetal health led participants to cancel their original pregnancy plans (P&lt;10<sup>-3</sup> ). Three in ten couples of childbearing age, who originally expressed their intention of becoming pregnant, canceled their pregnancy plans after the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak has brought new challenges to people's physical and mental health. Effective policies and measures can help to improve people's fertility intentions with respect to having children.","Zhu, Wu, Liang, Yan, He, Chen, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13366","20200903","COVID-19; Fertility intention; Government policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-07","",4438,""
"COVID-19 restrictions and mental distress among American adults: evidence from Corona Impact Survey (W1 and W2)","The present study examines the impact of coronavirus-related restrictions on mental health among American adults, and how this relationship varies as a function of time and two measures of vulnerability (preexisting physical symptoms and job insecurity). We draw on data from two waves of Corona Impact Survey, which were fielded in late April and early of May 2020. Multilevel models were used to analyze the hierarchically nested data. Experiencing coronavirus disease-2019 restrictions significantly raise mental distress. This association is stronger for individuals with preexisting health conditions and those who worry about job prospects. These findings hold with the inclusion of region-wave covariates (number of deaths, wave dummy and aggregate measure of restrictions). Finally, there is a cross-level interaction: the restriction-distress connection is more pronounced in the second wave of data. Our research indicates that people who are more physically and/or financially vulnerable suffer more from the imposed restrictions, i.e. 'social isolation'. The mental health impact of coronavirus pandemic is not constant but conditional on the level of vulnerability.","Kim, Laurence","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa148","20200903","COVID-19; financial insecurity; mental distress; physical vulnerability; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-07","",4439,""
"Loneliness and COVID-19 preventive behaviours among Japanese adults","There is some evidence that loneliness may be linked to poorer health behaviours. Despite this, there has been little research to date on the relationship between loneliness and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. We studied these associations in a sample of the Japanese population. Data were analysed from an online survey of 2000 adults undertaken in April and May 2020. Loneliness was assessed with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Information was also collected on 13 COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Regression analyses were used to examine associations. In linear regression models adjusted for demographic and mental health variables, both dichotomous and continuous loneliness measures were negatively associated with engaging in COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Logistic regression analyses further showed that loneliness was also associated with reduced odds for a variety of individual preventive behaviours including wearing a mask (odds ratio [OR]: 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.95), disinfecting hands (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.94) and social distancing when outdoors (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.92). Loneliness is associated with lower engagement in COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Interventions to prevent or ameliorate loneliness during the ongoing pandemic may be important in combating the spread of the coronavirus.","Stickley, Matsubayashi, Ueda","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa151","20200903","COVID-19; Japan; hygiene; lonely; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-07","",4440,""
