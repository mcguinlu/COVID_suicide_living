"Psychological factors and consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it has unpredictably changed our whole way of life. As suggested by the analysis of economic data on sales, this dramatic scenario has also heavily impacted individuals' spending levels. To better understand these changes, the present study focused on consumer behavior and its psychological antecedents. Previous studies found that crises differently affect people's willingness to buy necessities products (i.e., utilitarian shopping) and non-necessities products (i.e., hedonic shopping). Therefore, in examining whether changes in spending levels were associated with changes in consumer behavior, we adopted a fine-grained approach disentangling between necessities and non-necessities. We administered an online survey to 3833 participants (age range 18-64) during the first peak period of the contagion in Italy. Consumer behavior toward necessities was predicted by anxiety and COVID-related fear, whereas consumer behavior toward non-necessities was predicted by depression. Furthermore, consumer behavior toward necessities and non-necessities was predicted by personality traits, perceived economic stability, and self-justifications for purchasing. The present study extended our understanding of consumer behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results could be helpful to develop marketing strategies that consider psychological factors to meet actual consumers' needs and feelings.","Di Crosta, Ceccato, Marchetti, La Malva, Maiella, Cannito, Cipi, Mammarella, Palumbo, Verrocchio, Palumbo, Di Domenico","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256095","20210816","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17146,""
"Health-related quality of life among US young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: Psychiatric symptoms and emotional experiences to target within clinical practice","The current study aimed to determine the role of psychological experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (depression, anxiety, loneliness, and COVID-19-related grief and worry) on young adult physical and mental health functioning as measured by health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Using hierarchical multiple regression analyses, this cross-sectional study examined psychological predictors of physical and mental health functioning among young adults (age 18 to 30 years) from April 13 to September 5, 2020. Pre-existing depression diagnoses (beta = -0.124, P &lt; .001), current depression symptoms (beta = -0.298, P &lt; .001), and COVID-19-related worry (beta = -0.142, P &lt; .001) significantly predicted poorer physical health functioning. Current depression and anxiety symptoms (beta = -0.342 and beta = -0.268), loneliness (beta = -0.135), and COVID-19-related grief (beta = -0.180) predicted lower self-reported mental health functioning (P &lt; .001). Black (beta = -0.072) and Hispanic/Latinx participants (beta = -0.082) were more likely to indicate poorer physical health functioning (P &lt; .01) relative to White participants, whereas women reported poorer mental health relative to men (beta = -0.047, P &lt; .05). This study identifies potential negative impacts of pandemic-related psychological experiences for young adults' health during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to consider mental health symptomatology, COVID-19-related experiences, race, and gender when designing efforts to address long-term implications on health.","Liu, Zhang, Hyun, Wong, Hahm","https://doi.org/10.12788/acp.0033","20210816","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17147,""
"An exploration of parental awareness, knowledge, and concerns related to COVID-19","COVID-19 rapidly spread worldwide with high morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to detect parental concerns along with their awareness of and attitudes towards COVID-19 among patients admitted to our inpatient and outpatient clinics. This study was conducted at a children's hospital with 141 parents of children who were patients in the inpatient and outpatient clinics. Parents were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire and psychiatric scales that included the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Impact of Events Scale-Revised form (IES-R). The study sample consisted of 141 parents, of which 59 were parents of inpatients and 82 were parents of outpatients. The most known COVID-19 symptoms were fever, difficulty in breathing, and cough, respectively. The most preferred precaution was ""staying at home."" We found a significant positive correlation between the number of precautions and BAI score (R = .169, P = .046). Inpatients' parents IES-R scores were significantly higher than outpatients' parents IES-R scores. Parents were found to be aware of the COVID-19 pandemic regardless of education status and family income. Participants' IES-R scores revealed significant differences in terms of COVID-19 impact on psychological health between the parents of inpatient and outpatient children; inpatients' parents were more concerned about COVID-19.","SarÃ„Â±, Terin, AÃƒÂ§Ã„Â±kel, Akkaya, Ã…Å¾enel","https://doi.org/10.12788/acp.0040","20210816","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17148,""

"Social and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on middle-school students: Attendance options and changes over time","The purpose of this study was to determine whether restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the social and psychological well-being of early adolescent schoolchildren. Participants were 309 youth (51% female, average age = 12.38 years) enrolled in the sixth, seventh, or eighth grades of a single middle school located in northeastern Pennsylvania, a state that took a moderately proactive approach to the pandemic. Employing a cross-sectional design, students in three instructional conditions (100% in-person, hybrid, 100% online) were compared on nine outcome measures (perceived parental support, perceived parental knowledge, peer deviance, neutralization, cognitive impulsivity, depression, delinquency, bullying victimization, and bullying perpetration). There were no significant between-groups differences, although there was a borderline significant effect for depression (100% online &gt; 100% in-person, <i>p</i> = .06). A second set of analyses employed a longitudinal design and compared 174 children who completed the test battery in November 2019, 3 months before the start of the pandemic, and then again in November 2020, 9 months after the start of the pandemic. Three out of nine outcomes displayed significant change: A small reduction in parental support and modest increments in neutralization beliefs and cognitive impulsivity. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the three instructional conditions and only a handful of relatively small and predictable longitudinal changes between November 2019 and November 2020, there were a fair number of individual students who experienced moderate (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50%) increases in depression (17.6%), cognitive impulsivity (15.8%), and bullying victimization (11.7%).

"Mental Health and COVID-19: Challenges and Multimodal Clinical Solutions","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an exponential rise in mental health issues. Studies have shown that, in times of increased unemployment rates and economic downturn, rates of mental health issues, suicide, substance use, and domestic violence tend to increase. Barriers to care, including stigma and decreased access to providers, contribute to morbidity and mortality. Telehealth services are being utilized to help increase access to care, and economic stimulus packages have been created to help with the financial burden that is often associated with increased mental health stressors. Efforts to prevent burnout and other policy recommendations can help decrease mental health issues in first responders and health care professionals, who are at an increased risk for these problems. Increasing the ability to provide wellness screenings to the general population, to educate the public about preventive measures and practices, and to provide mental health and substance use treatment, such as medication management and therapy services, are among top priorities to further reduce the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on mental illness.","Masand, Patkar, Tew, Hoerner, Szabo, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRA.0000000000000560","20210816","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17152,""

"Resource loss and mental health during COVID-19: Psychosocial protective factors among US older adults and those with chronic disease","Across the globe, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the physical and mental health of several vulnerable groups. In a series of two cross-sectional studies conducted April to July 2020, we examined its acute mental health effects on two vulnerable U.S. community samples-home-bound older adults who were at or below the poverty line (Study 1, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 293, M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 76.94, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.64; 75.1% female, 67.9% Black) and adults with chronic disease (Study 2, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 322, M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 62.20, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 12.22; 46.3% female, 28.3% racial/ethnic minorities). Based on the conservation of resources theory, we hypothesised that pandemic-related resource loss would be associated with greater mental distress, but perceived social support and positive psychological characteristics (trait resilience and optimism) would buffer against this adverse effect. Across both samples of vulnerable adults, pandemic-related resource loss was related to mental distress. Perceived social support was related to lower mental distress but did not consistently buffer the effect of resource loss on mental health. However, in Study 2, both trait resilience and optimism buffered this relationship. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the conservation of resources theory.","McElroy-Heltzel, Shannonhouse, Davis, Lemke, Mize, Aten, Fullen, Hook, Van Tongeren, Davis, Miskis","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12798","20210816","COVID-19; Distress; Mental health; Resource loss; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17154,""
"Challenges for Child Mental Health Raised by School Closure and Home Confinement During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted the education of children worldwide. This paper reviews the psychological effects of this action on children and the impact on school-based services. Emerging epidemiologic findings have generated an intense debate about the need for, and potential benefit of, school closure in the context of COVID-19. International research reveals reactions in children that are not typically considered in the disaster literature as well as those that arise in other disasters. School closure also has curtailed the delivery of mental health services commonly offered in schools. The debate about school closure will likely persist depending on local disease conditions and school readiness. Moreover, school closure is a possibility in future epidemics and pandemics and other disasters. The benefit of school closure must be balanced against the risk to children's education and psychosocial development.","Pfefferbaum","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01279-z","20210816","COVID-19; Children; Disaster; Pandemic; Public health; School closure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17155,""

"Determinants of quality of life among individuals seeking mental health care after termination of state of emergency due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","Prompted by the need to measure the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 on main areas of quality of life related to mental health (MH), the COV-19-impact on quality of life (COV19-QoL) scale has been developed recently. We measured how patients seeking face-to-face MH care perceived the coronavirus disease 2019 impact on QoL and how socio-demographic factors, stress, and personality contributed to QoL in this diagnostically diverse population.Patients aged 18 to 65Ã¢â‚¬Å years (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 251) who came for the first time to the outpatient units during the 6-week index-period (May 21-July 1, 2020) were included. The cross-sectional assessment involved sociodemographic variables, working diagnosis, personality traits (7-dimension model, including HEXACO and DELTA), stress (list of threatening experiences and proximity to virus), and COV19-QoL.The perceived impact of the pandemic on QoL was above the theoretical mean of a 5-point scale (COV19-QolÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 3.1Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 1.2). No association between total COV19-QoL score, sociodemographic parameters, and working diagnoses was found in the present sample. After testing whether positional (threatening experiences), or dispositional (personality) factors were predominant in the perceived impact of COV-19 on QoL, significant predictors of the outcome were personality traits Disintegration (BÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.52; PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .01) and Emotionality (BÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.18; PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .05).It seems that pervasiveness and uncertainty of the pandemic threat triggers-especially in those high on Disintegration trait-a chain of mental events with the decrease of QoL as a final result.

"Longitudinal changes of laboratory measurements after discharged from hospital in 268 COVID-19 pneumonia patients","Monitoring recovery process of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients released from hospital is crucial for exploring residual effects of COVID-19 and beneficial for clinical care. In this study, a comprehensive analysis was carried out to clarify residual effects of COVID-19 on hospital discharged patients. Two hundred sixty-eight cases with laboratory measured data at hospital discharge record and five follow-up visits were retrospectively collected to carry out statistical data analysis comprehensively, which includes multiple statistical methods (e.g., chi-square, T-test and regression) used in this study. Study found that 13 of 21 hematologic parameters in laboratory measured dataset and volume ratio of right lung lesions on CT images highly associated with COVID-19. Moderate patients had statistically significant lower neutrophils than mild and severe patients after hospital discharge, which is probably caused by more efforts on severe patients and slightly neglection of moderate patients. COVID-19 has residual effects on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of patients who have hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After released from hospital, female showed better performance in T lymphocytes subset cells, especially T helper lymphocyte%(16%higher than male). According to this sex-based differentiation of COVID-19, male should be recommended to take clinical test more frequently to monitor recovery of immune system. Patients over 60 years old showed unstable recovery process of immune cells (e.g., CD45Ã¢â‚¬Å +Ã¢â‚¬Å lymphocyte) within 75 days after discharge requiring longer clinical care. Additionally, right lung was vulnerable to COVID-19 and required more time to recover than left lung. Criterion of hospital discharge and strategy of clinical care should be flexible in different cases due to residual effects of COVID-19, which depend on several impact factors. Revealing remaining effects of COVID-19 is an effective way to eliminate disorder of mental health caused by COVID-19 infection.","Huang, Miao, Zhang, Yang, Zhang, Lure, Wang, Jaeger, Guo, Xu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3233/XST-210920","20210816","COVID-19 pneumonia; computed tomography (CT) lung image; dynamic changes analysis; hospital discharge; routine blood test parameters","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17159,""
"Low-quality employment trajectories and risk of common mental disorders, substance use disorders and suicide attempt: a longitudinal study of the Swedish workforce","Objective High-quality longitudinal evidence exploring the mental health risk associated with low-quality employment trajectories is scarce. We therefore aimed to investigate the risk of being diagnosed with common mental disorders, substance use disorders, or suicide attempt according to low-quality employment trajectories. Methods A longitudinal register-study based on the working population of Sweden (N=2Ã‚Â 743 764). Employment trajectories (2005-2009) characterized by employment quality and pattern (constancy, fluctuation, mobility) were created. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models for first incidence (2010-2017) diagnosis of common mental disorders, substance use disorders and suicide attempt as dependent on employment trajectories. Results We identified 21 employment trajectories, 10 of which were low quality (21%). With the exception of constant solo self-employment, there was an increased risk of common mental disorders (HR 1.07-1.62) and substance use disorders (HR 1.05-2.19) for all low-quality trajectories. Constant solo self-employment increased the risk for substance use disorders among women, while it reduced the risk of both disorders for men. Half of the low-quality trajectories were associated with a risk increase of suicide attempt (HR 1.08-1.76). Conclusions Low-quality employment trajectories represent risk factors for mental disorders and suicide attempt in Sweden, and there might be differential effects according to sex - especially in terms of self-employment. Policies ensuring and maintaining high-quality employment characteristics over time are imperative. Similar prospective studies are needed, also in other contexts, which cover the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the mechanisms linking employment trajectories with mental health.","Jonsson, Muntaner, Bodin, Alderling, Rebeka, BurstrÃƒÂ¶m, Davis, Gunn, Hemmingsson, JuliÃƒÂ , Kjellberg, Kreshpaj, Orellana, Padrosa, Wegman, Matilla-Santander","https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.3978","20210816","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17160,""
"Inherent Dangers of Using Non-US Food and Drug Administration-Approved Substances of Abuse","Use of US Food and Drug Administration-approved substances of abuse has innate risks due to pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of the medications, but the risk when using nonapproved drug products is much greater. Unbeknownst to the user, the dose of active ingredients in substances of abuse can vary substantially between different products because of manufacturing practices or improper storage. Even naturally occurring substances of abuse can have extensive dosage variability because of effects of the growing season and conditions, or differences in harvesting, storage, or manufacture of the finished products. Many illicit substances are adulterated, to make up for intentional underdosing or to enhance the effect of the intended active ingredient. These adulterants can be dangerous and produce direct cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, or dermatologic reactions or obscure adverse effects. Finally, an illicit substance can be contaminated or substituted for another one during its manufacture, leading to differences in adverse events, adverse event severity, or the drug interaction profile. Substances can be contaminated with microbes that induce infections or heavy metals that can damage organs or cause cancer. This milieu of undisclosed substances can also induce drug interactions.

"Psychologic Distress and Quality of Life After ICU Treatment for Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter, Observational Cohort Study","To quantify short- and long-term psychologic distress, that is, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, and the health-related quality of life in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors. A prospective, observational cohort study. Postcoronavirus disease 2019 clinics of three hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Adult patients admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 to the ICU, who visited the postcoronavirus disease 2019 follow-up clinic. The primary outcomes were psychologic distress and overall and mental health-related quality of life, assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short-Form 36, and European Quality of Life 5D, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post hospital discharge. Second, we compared 3-month psychologic and mental health-related quality of life outcomes with a historical critical illness survivor cohort and overall and mental health-related quality of life with the Dutch population. We included 118 patients with a median age of 61 years (95% range, 36-77 yr) of whom 79 (68%) were male. At 6 weeks, 13 patients (23%) reported psychologic distress, copresence of probable psychiatric disorders was common, and no decline in psychologic distress was observed throughout follow-up. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients tend to suffer less from posttraumatic stress disorder and reported less severe symptoms of anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety Score: 3 [0-17] vs 5 [0-16]; estimated mean difference 2.3 [95% CI, 0.0-4.7]; <i>p</i> = 0.05) and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Depression Score: 3 [0-15] vs 5 [0-16]; estimated mean difference 2.4 [95% CI, 0.1-2.4]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) than the historical critical illness cohort. Overall and mental health-related quality of life increased over time. Coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors reported better mental health-related quality of life than our historical cohort, but overall and mental health-related quality of life was still poorer than the Dutch population. Psychologic distress was common in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors and remained similar until 6 months after hospital discharge. Health-related quality of life increased over time and was higher than in a historical cohort, but was lower than in the Dutch population. Our findings highlight that coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors should be monitored after ICU treatment to detect possible psychologic distress.","Vlake, Van Bommel, Hellemons, Wils, Bienvenu, Schut, Klijn, Van Bavel, Gommers, Van Genderen","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCE.0000000000000497","20210816","coronavirus disease 2019; depression; intensive care unit; postintensive care syndrome; posttraumatic stress disorder; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17162,""
"Older Adults' Mental Health Through Leisure Activities During COVID-19: A Scoping Review","Older adults are at high risk for mental health distress due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. This scoping review aimed to map emerging evidence on the types of leisure and recreation activities (LRA) adults, 60 years and older, are engaged in for their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified 10 studies on LRA for mental health by older adults with COVID-19 mitigation from a search of the following databases: Medline/PubMed, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, and Epistemonicos. A narrative synthesis of the data revealed age cohorts of young-old (60-69Ã‚Â years) and middle-old (70-79Ã‚Â years) engaging mainly in online LRA for mental health compared to the older-old adults (80Ã‚Â years and older). The middle-old (70-79Ã‚Â years) and older-old adults (80-89Ã‚Â years) engaged in more physical LRA for mental health compared to the younger-old adults. Across age cohorts, the older adults engaged in social connectedness LRA for mental health wellbeing.

"Effect of EAP Psychological Intervention on Improving the Mental Health of Medical Workers Under the Novel Coronavirus Epidemic in China","<b>Background:</b> Due to the novel coronavirus epidemic, medical workers are under immense psychological pressure. As such, the East Campus of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital actively adopted the Symptoms Checklist 90 (SCL-90) to evaluate the mental health of hospital staff before and after the psychological intervention from the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). <b>Methods:</b> Medical workers from the East Campus of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital were recruited for this study. Psychological evaluations were conducted using the SCL-90, with a score of &gt;160 regarded as a positive result, or in other words, an indication of abnormal psychological symptoms. The EAP adopted different forms of psychological interventions for healthcare professionals, and participation in these measures was entirely voluntary. Medical workers completed the SCL-90 again after participating in the psychological intervention, and we analyzed the changes between their two assessments. <b>Results:</b> Of the 1,198 total medical staff present at the hospital, 844 participated in the initial survey, while only 652 completed the survey a second time (i.e., post-psychological intervention). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that the psychological status of hospital staff was correlated with gender, education background, and fertility status (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The results showed that, compared with women, men's mental health status was better, with an OR value of 0.598 (0.372-0.962). Groups with high school, junior high school, and below education levels were at higher risk of psychological problems, with OR values of 23.655 (2.815-198.784) and 9.09 (2.601-31.801), respectively. Administrative occupations and having two or more children were protective factors for mental health, and the OR values were 0.400 (0.175-0.912) and 0.327 (0.152-0.703), respectively. Following the psychological intervention, we found that the mental health of hospital workers improved, as indicated by their second SCL-90 evaluations, although the proportion of medical staff willing to participate in the second evaluation was lower than the initial assessment. There were differences in the SCL-90 scores among different occupations, and there were also differences in the scores of employees of different occupations who had participated in the two evaluations. The employees of different positions who participated in the two evaluations were matched and analyzed and found that the depression and anxiety of the doctor group were significantly reduced. In the nursing group, the total score, somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and anxiety were significantly reduced. In the medical technician group, depression, anxiety, and paranoia were reduced considerably. Among office staff, no significant differences were found. Among workers, the total score, depression, and anxiety were significantly reduced. <b>Conclusion:</b> Hospitals have the potential to alleviate and reduce the psychological pressure placed on medical staff members through the EAP, which can actively adopt intervention and guidance measures. The findings of this study have important implications, as reducing abnormal psychological symptoms of healthcare professionals can be helpful in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic.","Xu, Liu, Xiao, Fang, Cheng, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.649157","20210816","EAP psychological intervention; SCL-90 psychological evaluation; employee assistance program; medical workers; novel coronavirus; psychological changes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17166,""

"Orthopaedic Surgeon Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> This study compares rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout among resident/fellow and attending physicians in orthopaedic surgery to other specialties during height/end of the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at our institution. Main outcomes and measures included suicidal ideation, Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression (PHQ-9) scores for depression, and 2 single-item measures for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. This study provides valuable information regarding orthopaedic surgeon mental health during world crises. <b>Methods:</b> This is a cross-sectional survey-based study of resident, fellow, and attending physicians from 26 specialties during and after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution from April 24, 2020 to May 15, 2020. The survey contained 22 items. This includes consent, demographics and general data, 2 single-item questions of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, and the PHQ-9. Subjects were eligible if they were a resident/fellow or attending physician at our institution. <b>Results:</b> The response rate for the study was 16.31%. Across all specialties rates were 6.2% depression, 19.6% burnout, and 6.6% suicidal ideation. The results for orthopaedic surgeons are as follows: 0% tentative diagnosis of depression, 3.8% suicidal ideation, and 4% burnout. Anesthesiology had the highest rate of depression (14.3%). Internal medicine and other non-surgical specialties had the highest rate of suicidal ideation (10.2%). Orthopaedic surgeons were significantly more likely to achieve work-life balance and experience less burnout than anesthesiologists and pediatricians. <b>Discussion:</b> Depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout continue to affect physicians across all specialties. These issues are amplified in light of crisis. Job satisfaction and rigorous training may be protective factors that allow orthopaedic surgeons to adapt to novel clinical settings under stress when compared to anesthesiologists and pediatricians. Resilience training and stress management strategies should continue to be investigated to better prepare physicians for world crises.","Al-Humadi, CÃƒÂ¡ceda, Bronson, Paulus, Hong, Muhlrad","https://doi.org/10.1177/21514593211035230","20210816","COVID-19; burnout; depression; mental health; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17168,""
"Criterion Validity and Reliability of SF-12 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2) in a Student Population during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, led to strict domestic quarantine, social isolation policies, and consequently significant psycho-emotional and lifestyle changes. The individual and societal fear and anxiety cause significant stress affecting health-related quality of life (HRQOL). There is evidence of the psychological and mental health effects of the current pandemic on students, who are known to be a vulnerable population. A decrease in physical activity was reported among students, and it is known to contribute to stress levels, which is strongly associated with HRQOL. This study is aimed at evaluating the validity and reliability of SF-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) in the assessment of self-perceived quality of life of Italian students following lifestyle changes due to the outbreak of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted with university students attending the faculty of Medicine and Surgery or Health Professions. The Physical Component Summary (PCS12) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS12) of SF-12v2 were compared to the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Internal consistency was examined using Cronbach's Alpha Coefficient. Concurrent validity was evaluated comparing SF-12v2 values to PSS scores, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) was calculated. Cross-cultural validity was investigated through several analyses for correlations between SF-12v2 scores and the gender of participants, University of Italy, body mass index (BMI), and time spent sitting and exercising. The SF-12v2 questionnaire was administered to 583 medical and health professionals' students in July 2020. Cronbach's Alpha showed acceptable reliability for PCS12 and MCS12. In line with expectations, PCS12 scores differed by BMI groups, while the MCS12 was associated with PSS score and showed differences between genders, BMI groups, time spent sitting, and time spent exercising.

"Investigating the impact of quarantine on mental health: insights from the COVID-19 international border surveillance study in Canada","Nations throughout the world are imposing mandatory quarantine on those entering the country. Although such measures may be effective in reducing the importation of COVID-19, the mental health implications remain unclear. This study sought to assess mental well-being and factors associated with changes in mental health in individuals subject to mandatory quarantine following travel. Travellers arriving at a large, urban international airport completed online questionnaires on arrival and days 7 and 14 of mandated quarantine. Questionnaire items, such as travel history, mental health, attitudes toward COVID-19, and protection behaviours, were drawn from the World Health Organization Survey Tool for COVID-19. There was a clinically significant decline in mental health over the course of quarantine among the 10 965 eligible participants. Poor mental health was reported by 5.1% of participants on arrival and 26% on day 7 of quarantine. Factors associated with a greater decline in mental health were younger age, female gender, negative views toward quarantine measures and engaging in fewer COVID-19 prevention behaviours. For instance, travellers who stated that they rarely wore masks had nearly three times higher odds of developing poor mental health. Although the widespread use of quarantine may be effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, the mental health implications are profound and have largely been ignored in policy decisions. Psychiatry has a role to play in contributing to the public policy debate to ensure that all aspects of health and well-being are reflected in decisions to isolate people from others.","Regehr, Goel, De Prophetis, Jamil, Mertz, Rosella, Bulir, Smieja","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.977","20210816","COVID-19; Quarantine; cohort study; international travel; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17171,""

I situate sociotherapy and socioanalysis in the discipline of sociology and in relation to Freudian psychoanalysis. I offer my own sociotherapeutic practice as an illustration of how the societal and the psychological, the social, and the psychic must be engaged in concert.

"Effects of Physical Activity and Mindfulness on Resilience and Depression During the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic","The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic generated a significant number of stressors that the Swiss population had to deal with. In order to cope with and adapt to such adversity, it is essential to have protective factors that allow for resilience. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness and physical activity on depression and resilience during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A quantitative method was adopted asking participants who were engaged in physical activity or mindfulness to fill a battery of measures of depression and resilience and some demographic questions. The results showed that mindfulness practice strengthened the initial level of resilience of practitioners, suggesting that mindfulness meditation is a tool for coping with adversity during a potentially traumatic event. Conversely, physical activity practitioners maintained a stable resilience score over time, suggesting that exposure to adversity did not disrupt their state of biopsychospiritual homeostasis.

"Subjective Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Schizotypy and General Mental Health in Germany and the United Kingdom, for Independent Samples in May and in October 2020","Studies reported a strong impact on mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March-June, 2020. In this study, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on mental health in general and on schizotypal traits in two independent general population samples of the United Kingdom (May sample N: 239, October sample N: 126; participation at both timepoints: 21) and in two independent general population samples of Germany (May sample N: 543, October sample N: 401; participation at both timepoints: 100) using online surveys. Whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cut-off for further psychological investigation were higher in the May sample compared to the October sample, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were higher in the October sample. We investigated potential associations, using general linear regression models (GLM). For schizotypy scores, we found that loneliness, use of drugs, and financial burden were more strongly corrected with schizotypy in the October compared to the May sample. We identified similar associations for GSI, as for schizotypy scores, in the May and October samples. We furthermore found that living in the United Kingdom was related to higher schizotypal scores or GSI. However, individual estimates of the GLM are highly comparable between the two countries. In conclusion, this study shows that while the general psychological impact is lower in the October than the May sample, potentially showing a normative response to an exceptional situation; schizotypy scores are higher at the second timepoint, which may be due to a stronger impact of estimates of loneliness, drug use, and financial burden. The ongoing, exceptional circumstances within this pandemic might increase the risk for developing psychosis in some individuals. The development of general psychological symptoms and schizotypy scores over time requires further attention and investigation.","Daimer, Mihatsch, Ronan, Murray, Knolle","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.667848","20210816","COVID Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 19; SCL-27; SPQ; anxiety; depression; mental health; psychosis; schizotypy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17176,""
"Psychometric Evaluation of the Chinese Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL) Outcome Measure and Assessment of Health-Related Quality of Life During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The primary objective was to translate the Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL) measures from English to traditional Chinese and assess their psychometric properties in Hong Kong (HK) Chinese population. The secondary objective was to investigate the mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of this sample during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Recovering Quality of Life was translated to Traditional Chinese adhering to standard guideline recommended by the official distributors. Five hundred members of the general population were successfully recruited to participate in a telephone-based survey. The following psychometric properties of the ReQoL were evaluated: construct, convergent, and known-group validity and internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The item measurement invariance was assessed on the basis of differential item functioning (DIF). Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between respondents' characteristics and mental HRQoL. Results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a two-factor structure of the ReQoL. The ReQoL showed significant correlations with the other mental health, quality of life, and well-being measures, which indicated a satisfactory convergent validity. Known-group validity confirmed that ReQoL is able to differentiate between people with different mental health status. The (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91 and 0.76 for positive [PF] and negative [NF] factor), and McDonald's omega of 0.89 (PF = 0.94, NF = 0.82) indicated the ReQoL has good reliability as well as test-retest reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.75. Four items showed negligible DIF with respect to age. Respondents who were highly educated and without psychological problems reported a high ReQoL score. Traditional Chinese ReQoL was shown to be a valid and reliable instrument to assess the recovery-focused quality of life in HK general population. Future studies are needed to appraise its psychometric properties in local people experiencing mental disorders.","Xu, Keetharuth, Wang, Cheung, Wong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.663035","20210816","China; ReQoL; health-related quality of life; mental health; psychometric properties; recovery; validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17177,""
"Autogenic Training Improves the Subjective Perception of Physical and Psychological Health and of Interpersonal Relational Abilities: An Electronic Field Survey During the COVID-19 Crisis in Spain","Currently, humanity is facing one of the most critical situations of this century, the COVID-19. The adverse effects of the pandemic on the mental health of the population are well known. Fear of illness, confinement, lack of financial resources, or poor social support can influence people's mental state. Despite these risks, several psychological resources may help address this situation. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a self-relaxation techniques known as autogenic training. Autogenic training is a well-known method in Europe for the treatment of anxiety and stress disorders. The practice of autogenic training is also reported to improve neurovegetative and immune regulation. This study focuses on describing how autogenic training is helping its practitioners to cope with the pandemic. Specifically, they report strong beneficial effects on their physical, psychological, and relational health. In total, 75 autogenic training practitioners (41 women), age 22-71, participated in the survey. An <i>ad-hoc</i> questionnaire was developed to collect information on sociodemographic variables, health status during the pandemic, characteristics of their AT practice, and response to the pandemic as outcome variables. The questionnaire was distributed through Google Forms in the first week of September 2020. The results show that there was an increase in the practice of autogenic therapy during the pandemic, especially among women. In addition, the majority of participants (88%) remained healthy during the pandemic. Furthermore, the results show that autogenic training is very useful for physical and psychological health and for a better understanding of others. Therefore, the practice of autogenic training is recommended to people who live moments of anxiety, are afraid of illness, or feel that they have to improve the quality of relationships with others.","de Rivera, Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Dosil-SantamarÃƒÂ­a, de Rivera-Monterrey","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.616426","20210816","COVID-19; anxiety; autogenic therapy; autogenics; empathy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17178,""
"Psychological Distress and Tobacco Use Among Hospital Workers During COVID-19","<b>Background and Aims:</b> This work aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital workers' psychological parameters and attitudes toward substance use, before and during the French COVID-19 lockdown. <b>Methods:</b> An online survey was proposed to the staff of the University Hospital of Nice and Sainte-Marie psychiatric hospital in France from May 18 to June 6, 2020 assessing changes in daily habits, psychological distress and changes in substance use, including smoking. <b>Results:</b> A total of 702 respondents (80.3% female) filled out the survey. Overall, most of the workers reported increased stress, irritability, sadness, decreased motivation, and a worse quality of sleep after the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown. Additionally, hospital workers who were more likely to use tobacco during the COVID-19 lockdown reported increased sadness (<i>OR</i> = 1.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), loss of motivation (<i>OR</i> = 0.86, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), alcohol consumption (<i>OR</i> = 3.12, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), lower incomes (<i>OR</i> = 1.69, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), living alone (<i>OR</i> = 1.77, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and doing less physical activity (<i>OR</i> = 0.36, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> During the first lockdown, significant psychological changes (sadness, distress, irritability) associated with changes in tobacco use and physical activity were reported.

"Risk and Protective Factors for the Mental Health of Brazilian Healthcare Workers in the Frontline of COVID-19 Pandemic","The objective was to compare the mental health indicators of health workers providing care to individuals with COVID-19 in Brazil, considering sociodemographic and occupational variables and the risk perception of contamination by the Sars-CoV-2 of workers from different professions, identifying risk and protective factors. A sample of 916 health workers was assessed: physicians, nursing workers, and workers from other professions (psychologists, physical therapists, nutritionists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, dentists, pharmacists, and social workers). REDCAP software was used to collect data online, using standardized instruments to assess anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and insomnia, and one questionnaire addressed risk and protective variables. Statistical techniques for comparing groups were used along with logistic regression analysis. The results revealed that all the groups presented indicators of significant mental health problems (&gt;36%), especially the nursing group. A larger percentage of participants, regardless of the profession, presented a high rate of insomnia disorders, while posttraumatic stress was the least expressive. Occupational variables stand out as risk factors for mental health, with specificities among the different groups. A protective factor for all the groups was having positive professional prospects. The protective factors for the physicians group included support provided by co-workers, being older and a man, while being satisfied with physical protective measures implemented by the employing institution was a protective factor for the groups composed of nursing workers and other professionals. These findings are relevant for devising mental health care strategies.","OsÃƒÂ³rio, Silveira, Pereira-Lima, Crippa, Hallak, Zuardi, Loureiro","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.662742","20210816","Brazil; COVID-19; health workers; mental health; risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17181,""
"Psychological Effects of People Isolated in Hubei Due to COVID-19 Epidemic","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out from Wuhan in Hubei province, China, spread nationwide and then gradually developed into other countries in the world. The implementation of unprecedented strict isolation measures has affected many aspects of people's lives and posed a challenge to psychological health. To explore whether people isolated for 14 days due to having contact with COVID-19 patients had more psychosocial problems. We conducted an online survey from February 29 to March 10, 2020. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and coping style were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire-20-Chinese Version. This study included 1,315 isolated respondents in Hubei province (58.5% located in Wuhan). 69.3% respondents isolated at home, 30.7% respondents isolated at centralized quarantined spot. Of all respondents, 66.8% reported depressive symptoms, 49.7% reported anxiety symptoms, 89.0% reported PTSD symptoms. The Cronbach ÃŽÂ± of the IES-R, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and total SCSQ-20 were 0.935, 0.847, 0.843, and 0.888, respectively. Persons who isolated at home were associated with a lower risk of PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). People who knew someone to have COVID-19 were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD symptoms (<i>P</i> = 0.001). As for coping style, higher level of passive coping style was associated with severe symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Our findings identify that person isolated during the COVID-19 epidemic was associated with high proportion of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms.

"Covid-19 and Its Link to Victimization Among College Students","In late 2019, the first cases of the disease (Covid-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 were discovered. A few months later, a global pandemic was declared that resulted in many lock-down orders across the U.S. These orders and the pandemic itself have sparked research examining the link between Covid-19 and crime. Relevant to the current study, a few studies have found a link between Covid-19 and domestic violence victimization, with many noting significant increases in domestic violence during the pandemic. Some research has also shown that victims are reaching out to domestic violence hotlines at increased rates. Despite these early studies, little is known about how Covid-19 is related to victimization, especially to types other than domestic violence, and how victims may fare during the pandemic. Thus, the current study addresses these gaps by using national level college student data from Fall 2020. Findings show that about 14% of students indicated they had a confirmed test or had symptoms consistent with Covid-19 without a confirmed test. Additionally, having a Covid-19 diagnosis or symptoms were related to all four victimization types and polyvictimization, and being a victim and a polyvictim were related to increased Covid-19-related stress and financial problems. Lastly, victims had increased odds of feeling like psychological or mental health services were somewhat or much more difficult to access during the pandemic relative to non-victims. It may be beneficial for universities to prioritize victims for outreach and consider using resources to modify counseling and other mental health services to better serve their students.","Daigle, Hancock, Chafin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-021-09638-5","20210816","College students; Covid-19; Financial impacts; Mental health services; Pandemic; Victimization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17184,""
"A randomized controlled trial of a mindfulness-based intervention in social workers working during the COVID-19 crisis","As one of the frontline professionals during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, social workers can face tremendous pressure, which can lead to mental health problems. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a brief mindfulness-based intervention had short- and middle-term effects on social workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a randomized controlled trial, 49 social workers were assigned to an experimental group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28) or a waitlist control group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21). The intervention was a four-week mindfulness-based program. The outcome variables were measured at pre- and post-test, and at one-month follow-up test. At post-test and follow-up, the workers in the experimental group reported higher mean scores in psychological flexibility and self-compassion and lower mean scores in depression compared to the workers in the waitlist control group. Although the experimental group also showed lower mean scores than the waitlist control group in anxiety and stress at both post-test and follow, the differences were not statistically significant. The findings suggest that a brief mindfulness-based intervention can improve psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and depression in social workers working during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to protected mental health, adding support to continuing development of such efficient mindfulness-based programs.

"Solution Focused Brief Therapy Telemental Health Suicide Intervention","One of the innumerable impacts of the coronavirus has been the change in how individuals provide services. For mental health providers, the pandemic required a sudden shift from in person to online service delivery. As therapists learn and embrace a new modality for providing therapy, crisis situations may present with some anxiety. With the pandemic increasing crisis situations for so many individuals, and teletherapy as a mode of service delivery being unlikely to go away after the pandemic, therapists require support in navigating crises situations online, in a medium that feels like the therapist has less control with their clients due to being in different physical locations. The authors believe that regardless of the primary model(s) therapists utilize in session, solution-focused brief therapy is an integrative model that uniquely captures client's resources and reasons for living and when clients are in crisis. The purpose of this paper is to present recommendations for applying solution-focused language in teletherapy practice, to provide ethical, evidenced based care for clients in crisis. A clinical vignette is used to illustrate the application of solution focused brief therapy for working with clients in crisis.

"[Does the COVID-19 pandemic condition the delusional content of patients with psychosis? An observational study]","<i>Introduction:</i> The primary objective is to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the triggers of psychopathology and on the delusional content of patients with psychotic symptoms treated during the first three months of the pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Madrid.<i>Methods:</i> We conducted a cross-sectional, observational and retrospective study of all patients attending the psychiatric emergency room (ER) between 11<sup>th</sup> March and 11<sup>th</sup> June 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were included. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test were performed to compare categorical variables. The level of statistical significance was set at <i>p</i>&lt;0.05.<i>Results:</i> In the first month of the pandemic, COVID-19 conditioned the delirious content of 38.5% of the admitted patients and acted as a direct trigger for 46.2% of consultations.

"Efficacy of a single-session online ACT-based mindfulness intervention among undergraduates in lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has trickle down effects psychologically on multiple strata of society, particularly university students. Apart from the worry of contracting or spreading COVID-19, Malaysian university students were also locked down in campuses, suffering significant psychological distress. Hence, an online mindfulness intervention was proposed to alleviate psychological distress and improve psychological flexibility and mindfulness. The study was a quasi-experimental study, with university students as participants. Intervention group participants were instructed to fill up online questionnaires which included basic demographics, as well as instruments assessing depression, anxiety, stress, mindfulness, psychological flexibility and fear of COVID-19 before and after the one-hour intervention. The control group completed pre- and postquestionnaires then subsequently crossed over to the intervention group. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess time*group effects. 118 participants were involved in this study. There was significant difference in terms of anxiety (F(1, 116) = 34.361, p&lt;.001, partial eta-squared = .229) and psychological flexibility between these two groups ( F(1, 116) = 11.010, p = .001, partial eta-squared = .087), while depression, stress, mindfulness and fear of COVID-19 showed no difference. Results of this study corroborates the efficacy of online single session mindfulness therapy as a viable short-term psychological intervention amidst financial and time constraint. As university students are in the age group of highest incidences of depressive and anxiety disorders, it is crucial to utilize resources to address as many students as possible to ensure maximal benefit.","Pang, Tio, Bhupendar Singh, Tseu, Shoesmith, Abd Rahim, Mohd Kassim","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2020-0172","20210815","Mindfulness; anxiety; online; psychological flexibility; single-session; university student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17189,""

Phase 2 consisted of literature indicated by specialists in occupational psychiatry and positive psychology. These materials were read and critically analyzed.

The articles reviewed were divided in the following categories: articles concerning work relationships in Brazil, articles describing the impact of pandemics on mental health and work, articles focusing on the work of health professionals during pandemics, articles about well-being at work, and papers proposing strategies to improve well-being and productivity and promote mental health. The Covid-19 pandemic can cause a significant impact on workers' mental health and productivity. Most professionals face the need to adapt to changes, which can decrease the feeling of well-being. Consequently, strategies to promote well-being and mental health at the work environment should be a priority. The work routines were modified after the installation of the Covid-19 pandemic and assessing these changes is essential to maintain workers' mental health. In this way, it is possible to achieve the promotion of general well-being, the reduction of stress, and the post-traumatic growth.","Loreto, de Azevedo, da Silva, Malloy-Diniz, Ornell, TrÃƒÂ©s, Kessler, de Castro","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0250","20210815","Coping; Covid-19; Mental health; Stress; Work; occupational health and safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17190,""
"Burnout in Healthcare Professionals During the Covid-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Care University Hospital: Evaluation of the Need for Psychological Support","Anxiety, stress and burnout are observed in healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and burnout and related risk factors in the healthcare workers and assistant personnel at a tertiary referral university hospital. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire were delivered on-line to all employees of our hospital. 683 individuals were to the study who completed and returned the forms between April 15-30, 2020. Stress, depression and anxiety levels were significantly higher in nurses. Emotional burnout and depersonalization symptoms were higher and personal accomplishment scores were lower in resident physicians and nurses in comparison to the other groups. Being single, having a child and living away from home were factors underlying the burnout severity. Frontline work in the Covid-19 clinics did not affect the levels of anxiety, stress and depression. On the basis of the cut off points of the HADS scores; anxiety disorder (OR: 7.19) and depression (OR 3.43) were the most relevant risk factors for emotional exhaustion. Anxiety disorder was also the main risk factor for depersonalization. Depersonalization was 2.7-fold more among the nurses complaining of being overworked. Social support from the work environment and the family was protective against depersonalization. Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the wellbeing of healthcare workers. The presence of depression and anxiety increased the risk of burnout. Social support can be expected to protect against burnout. It is, therefore, of great importance to implement urgently effective psychosocial and organizational interventions in order to protect the mental health of healthcare workers and to prevent burnout.","Ãƒâ€“nen SertÃƒÂ¶z, Kuman TunÃƒÂ§el, SertÃƒÂ¶z, Hepdurgun, Ã„Â°Ã…Å¸man HaznedaroÃ„Å¸lu, Bor","https://www.google.com/search?q=Burnout+in+Healthcare+Professionals+During+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+in+a+Tertiary+Care+University+Hospital:+Evaluation+of+the+Need+for+Psychological+Support.","20210815","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17191,""
"How SARS-CoV-2 might affect potassium balance via impairing epithelial sodium channels?","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Electrolyte disorders particularly potassium abnormalities have been repeatedly reported as common clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 may affect potassium balance by impairing the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The first hypothesis could justify the incidence of hypokalemia. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may enhance the activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) classical axis and further leading to over production of aldosterone. Aldosterone is capable of enhancing the activity of ENaC and resulting in potassium loss from epithelial cells. However, type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is able to inhibit the ENaC, but it is utilized in the case of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, therefore the ENaC remains activated. The second hypothesis describe the incidence of hyperkalemia based on the key role of furin. Furin is necessary for cleaving both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ENaC subunits. While the furin is hijacked by the virus, the decreased activity of ENaC would be expected, which causes retention of potassium ions and hyperkalemia. Given that the occurrence of hypokalemia is higher than hyperkalemia in COVID-19 patients, the first hypothesis may have greater impact on potassium levels. Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact role of ENaC in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Noori, Nejadghaderi, Sullman, Carson-Chahhoud, Ardalan, Kolahi, Safiri","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06642-0","20210815","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; ENaC; Electrolytes; Epithelial sodium channels; Hyperkalemia; Hypokalemia; SARS-CoV-2; Serum potassium","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17192,""
"Factors associated with current posttraumatic stress disorder among COVID-19 vaccinated older adults in Israel","This is the first study to examine COVID-19 vaccine-related stressors in the context of current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms amongst older adults exposed to traumatic events prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, with particular focus on the associations between ageism, vaccine-related stressors and PTSD. Five hundred and sixty-three participants aged 65 and above reported exposure to at least one traumatic event, their current PTSD level, physical and mental health, ageist attitudes, and vaccine related stressors. Univariate logistic regression revealed that depressive symptoms, ageism, vaccine hesitancy and severity of side effects were the main factors associated with clinical levels of current PTSD. These results suggest that older adults were vulnerable to intensified PTSD symptoms, not only as a result of greater depression, but also as a consequence of other factors, including ageism, vaccination hesitancy and vaccination side effects. Practitioners would benefit from awareness to these factors.","Palgi, Greenblatt-Kimron, Hoffman, Goodwin, Ben-Ezra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.08.005","20210815","Ageism; COVID-19; Post traumatic stress disorder; Vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine side effects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-17","",17193,""
