"COVID-19 Surveillance in the Biobank at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine","Background: Characterizing the experience and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among various populations remains challenging due to the limitations inherent in common data sources such as the electronic health record (EHR) or convenience sample surveys. Objective: To describe testing behaviors, symptoms, impact, vaccination status and case ascertainment during the COVID-19 pandemic using integrated data sources. Methods: In summer 2020 and 2021, we surveyed participants enrolled in the Biobank at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM, N = 180,599) about their experience with COVID-19. Prevalence of testing, symptoms, and the impacts of COVID-19 on employment, family life, and physical and mental health were calculated overall and by demographic categories. Using the Electronic Health Record (EHR), we compared COVID-19 case ascertainment and characteristics in the EHR versus the survey. Results: Of the 25,063 survey respondents (13.9%), 42.5% had been tested for COVID-19 and of those, 12.8% tested positive. Nearly half of those tested had symptoms and/or had been exposed to someone who was infected. Young adults (18-29 years) and Hispanics were more likely to have positive tests compared to older adults and persons of other racial/ethnic groups. Mental health (54.6%) and family life (48.8%) were most negatively affected by the pandemic and more so among younger groups and women; negative impacts on employment were more commonly reported among Black respondents. After integration with EHR data up to the time of the survey completion, 4.0% of survey respondents (n=1,006) had discordant COVID-19 case status between the EHR and the survey. Using all longitudinal EHR and survey data, we identified 11,472 COVID-positive cases among Biobank participants (6.4%). In comparison to COVID-19 cases identified through the survey, EHR-identified cases were younger and more likely to be Hispanic. Conclusions: Integrated data assets such as the Biobank at the CCPM are key resources for population health monitoring in response to public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Randi K Johnson; Katie M Marker; David Mayer; Jonathan Shortt; David Kao; Kathleen C Barnes; Jan T Lowery; Christopher R Gignoux","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.15.22271018","20220221","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27257,""
"Mental wellbeing and psychological distress in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparison across time","Objective Method Results Discussion This study aimed to assess the trajectory of wellbeing and psychological distress in a UK sample by comparing data taken from the first and second UK lockdowns.Wellbeing (indexed via the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale) and psychological distress (indexed via the K10) were measured in two surveys in large online samples from Wales, UK. The first survey (n = 12,989) took place 11â€“16 weeks into the first UK lockdown and the second survey (n = 10,428) took place 4â€“11 weeks into the second UK lockdown.Levels of wellbeing were lower in the second survey compared to the first survey, which were already low compared to pre-pandemic data (2019). Clinically significant levels of psychological distress were found in 40.4% of participants in the second survey, representing a 9.8% increase in prevalence from the first survey. Poorer mental health was found in women, younger adults, and those from deprived areas. The greatest reduction in mental health was found in the youngest age group (16-24 years old).The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to curb its spread continue to negatively impact the wellbeing of the UK population.

"Latinx Community College Students and the (In)Opportunities Brought by COVID-19 Pandemic","The disruption to higher education institutions across the United States created by COVID-19 affected more than 20 million college students. States cancelled in-person classes and campus activities quickly shifted to remote and virtual learning. The pandemic, along with its economic impact, altered education for community college students, creating a traumatic event that exasperated mental health conditions. In addition, job loss increased food insecurities drastically during COVID-19 and students across the country turned to their colleges for wraparound services. In this proposal, the authors review the impact of COVID-19 on marginalized college students, specifically Latinx students in a South Texas college. The findings revealed that Latinx students navigated virtual learning differently and were impacted by their access to technology, as well as their access to mental health services and food pantries.

"A qualitative examination of low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy to reduce anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective Method Results Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on mental health. There is an urgent need to deliver low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) tailored to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. The aim was to engage in a qualitative study of participantsâ€™ views surrounding anxiety and depression during the pandemic and feedback on the acceptability and usefulness of a low-intensity CBT intervention during the pandemic to inform intervention development and refinement.There were 21 participants (21â€“80 years, M = 40.90 years, SD = 16.33;71% female) from Australia who participated in qualitative interviews who had completed low-intensity CBT for anxiety and depression during the pandemic.Â Â Â Â Â Themes emerged including the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health, prior experience of psychological therapy, acceptability, and usefulness of the intervention, participantsâ€™ ideas for intervention improvement, and preferences for using the guide. The majority of participants reported the intervention was useful, however, suggested several areas including content and format to improve the intervention and feedback on what they would prefer for an intervention.A low-intensity CBT intervention was reported as useful and acceptable by participants for their concerns related to the pandemic and exacerbation of pre-existing anxiety and depression. (English) [ FROM AUTHOR] KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety and depression worldwide. There is a need to deliver low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.

"Distance education studentsâ€™ mental health, connectedness and academic performance during COVID-19: A mixed-methods study","In this study, we investigated the links between distance education studentsâ€™ mental health, connectedness, and academic performance during COVID-19, using a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. Online survey responses with a sample of 208 distance education studentsâ€”aged 18â€“84, 144 females, 60 males, three nonbinary individuals, most (163) self-identified as White Britishâ€”were analyzed using multiple regression, mediation, and content analysis. Connectedness (loneliness and a sense of connection to university) mediated links between mental health (wellbeing and anxiety) and academic performance. A subsample analysis with students who met clinical concern thresholds of anxiety and wellbeing (n = 123) revealed that poorer wellbeing was associated with less emotional intimacy, more loneliness, and poorer self-reported academic performance. Anxiety was associated with less emotional intimacy and higher relational intensity with one person, and poorer self-reported academic performance. These pathways were triangulated and contextualized within studentsâ€™ experiences of connectedness. Future research using a longitudinal design is needed to establish causal links.

"Pandemic threat and intergroup relations: how negative emotions associated with the threat of Covid-19 shape attitudes towards immigrants","Behavioural immune system theory predicts that attitudes towards immigrants become more hostile during times of increased threat from pathogens, as pandemic threat triggers aversive emotional responses, which in turn foster outgroup hostility. We test this notion in the context of the current Covid-19 crisis. Combining both original individual-level survey data of around 6,000 European respondents during the second Corona wave in winter 2020/2021 and regional data of pandemic threat in a multilevel design, we show that Covid-19 pandemic threat exposure in 105 European regions is indeed associated with more negative attitudes towards immigrants. Moreover, hierarchical path models indicate that Covid-19-induced anger fosters anti-immigrant attitudes, while we find no evidence that disgust as a pivotal avoidance-oriented emotion is crucial. In contrast to conventional wisdom, individuals reacting with fear to the pandemic hold more immigrant-friendly orientations. Taken together, our results indicate that the behavioural immune system (BIS) appears as a compelling obstacle to inclusive orientations. However, our findings challenge the notion that every emotion triggered by the BIS translates the pandemic threat into negative attitudes towards immigrants.

"Covid-19 and Rehabilitation Outcomes: A Case-Control Study","Objective Does the rehab process of acutely ill Covid-19 patients differ from recovered Covid-19 patients and other rehab patients? Comparison of the reha-course between acutely ill Covid-19 patients, recovered patients and rehab patients without Covid-19. Design: case-control study. Material and Methods Patients assigned to rehab in the period from 01.04 to 30.06.2020 with active Covid-19 disease (IG), recovered Covid-19 patients (PCG) and simultaneously rehabilitated persons matched by age, gender and comorbidity (Ko) were included. The primary endpoint was ADL- independence (FIM), secondary endpoints were quality of life (EQ5D-VAS), physical and mental health (PROMIS10) and mobility (TUG and 6MWT). Results 101 patients were included: IG=15;PCG=22;Ko=64. At entry, ADL-independence and quality of life were significantly highest in the IG (FIM IG 95.3 vs. PCG 78.3, vs. Ko 79.6;ANOVA p=0.029;EQ5D-VAS IG 56.1 vs. PCG 36.6 vs. Ko 51.0;ANOVA p=0.010). There were no differences in PROMIS10 and mobility. All three groups improved significantly from entry to discharge. The IG performed best in the FIM (IG 109.7 vs. PCG 97.2 vs. Ko 93.6;ANOVA p=0.039). The control group achieved the worst results with regard to mobility at discharge (TUG Ko 19.3 sec vs. 9.6 sec IG and 8.3 sec PCG). In the 6MWT, the PCG showed the best result (471 m vs. IG 416 m and Ko 389 m;difference n.s.). Conclusion All three patient groups benefited well from the rehab program. In addition, rehab measures bring a benefit also for isolated Covid-19 patients. In particular, recovered Covid-19 patients benefit greatly from the rehab program.","Petzold, S.; Carney, R.; Kool, J.; Bachmann, S.","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1729-7706","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Physikalische Medizin Rehabilitationsmedizin Kurortmedizin;: 11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27265,""
"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Related Discrimination and Mental Health in Five US Southern Cities","Evidence is mounting that stigma and discrimination related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minority groups, and that these experiences can worsen mental health. The present study sought to examine multiple types of COVID-related discrimination and their associations with mental health outcomes among racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. South, a region characterized by high levels of racial polarization and increasingly large numbers of undocumented immigrants. We used the cross-sectional, population-based COVID-19 Southern Cities Study (5/26/20-6/6/20) of n = 1,688 adults in Atlanta-GA, Austin-TX, Dallas-TX, Houston-TX, and New Orleans-LA. Three adapted scales (Everyday Discrimination, Major Discrimination, Heightened Vigilance) assessed self-reported COVID-related discrimination. Mental health outcomes included psychological distress, sleep troubles, physical reactions, and self-rated worsened mental health. Bivariable comparisons and adjusted logistic regression models were conducted. The study found that major discrimination was more common (p &lt; .001) among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic White respondents. All racial/ethnic minority groups experienced more everyday discrimination (p = .004) and heightened vigilance due to anticipated discrimination (p &lt; .001) than non-Hispanic White respondents. All discrimination types were associated with all mental health outcomes (Odds Ratio;OR range: 1.63-2.61) except everyday and major discrimination with sleep troubles. Results showing greater COVID-related discrimination for racial/ethnic minority groups confirm that these discrimination experiences are not solely about the infectious disease itself, but also entrenched with persistent racism. Responses to COVID-related discrimination should also consider long-lasting impacts on mental health for racial/ethnic minority groups even after the immediate pandemic ends.","Le, P. T.

"The longitudinal effect of COVID-19 infections and lockdown on mental health and the protective effect of neighbourhood social relations","Rationale. The effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on mental health is a major concern worldwide. Measuring the impacts, however, is difficult because of a lack of data that tracks and compares outcomes and potential protective social factors before and during lockdowns. Objective We aim to quantify the impact of a second lockdown in 2020 in the Australian city of Melbourne on levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, and analyse whether social relations in the neighbourhood may buffer against the worst effects of lockdown. Methods We draw on quasi-experimental data from a nationally-representative longitudinal survey conducted in Australia. We use a difference-in-difference approach with a number of control variables to estimate changes in mental health among respondents in Melbourne following the imposition of the lockdown. A measure of perceived neighbourhood social relations is included as an explanatory variable to analyse potential protective effects. Results Lockdown is estimated to have increased depressive symptoms by approximately 23% and feelings of loneliness by 4%. No effect on anxiety was detected. Levels of neighbourhood social relations were strongly negatively associated with mental health symptoms. A significant interaction between lockdown and neighbourhood social relations suggests that lockdown increased depressive symptoms by 21% for people with average perceived neighbourhood relations, compared with a 9.7% increase for people whose perceived relations is one standard deviation greater than average. Conclusion The results add to evidence of the harsh impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on mental health. Importantly, neighbourhood social relations and social cohesion more broadly may be an important source of social support in response to lockdowns. These findings provide important insights for researchers and policy-makers in how to understand and respond to the mental health impacts of COVID-19.","O'Donnell, James, CÃ¡rdenas, Diana, Orazani, Nima, Evans, Ann, Reynolds, Katherine J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114821","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114821, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27267,""
"Psychological and behavioral response on the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals with bipolar disorder: a multicenter study","The COVID-19 pandemic affects both mentally healthy and ill individuals. Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) constitute an especially vulnerable group. A multicentric online study was conducted in Austria, Denmark, and Germany after the first lockdown phase in 2020. In total, 117 healthy controls (HC) were matched according to age and sex to 117 individuals with BD. The survey included the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, Beck Depression Inventory-2, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and a self-constructed questionnaire assessing COVID-19 fears, emotional distress due to social distancing, lifestyle, and compliance to governmental measures. In individuals with BD, increased symptoms of depression, somatization, anxiety, distress due to social distancing, and poorer sleep quality were related to emotional distress due to social distancing. The correlation between emotional distress due to social distancing and anxiety showed 26% of shared variance in BD and 11% in HC. Negative lifestyle changes and lower compliance with COVID-19 regulatory measures were more likely to be observed in individuals with BD than in HC. These findings underscore the need for ongoing mental health support during the pandemic. Individuals with BD should be continuously supported during periods of social distancing to maintain a stable lifestyle and employ strategies to cope with COVID-19 fears.","Dalkner, Nina, Ratzenhofer, Michaela, Fleischmann, Eva, Fellendorf, Frederike T.; Bengesser, Susanne, Birner, Armin, Maget, Alexander, GroÃŸschÃ¤dl, Katja, Lenger, Melanie, Platzer, Martina, Queissner, Robert, SchÃ¶nthaler, Elena, Tmava-Berisha, Adelina, Berndt, Christina, Martini, Julia, Bauer, Michael, Sperling, Jon Dyg, Vinberg, May, Reininghaus, Eva Z.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114451","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114451, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27268,""

"COVID-19 information overload: Intolerance of uncertainty moderates the relationship between frequency of internet searching and fear of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty for people around the world. Research suggests that internet searching resulting in contradictory information can lead to increased levels of distress, particularly for people who have a high intolerance of uncertainty (IU). In the present correlational study, U.S. undergraduate students (NÂ =Â 317) indicated their IU, the frequency with which they search for COVID-19 related information online, their overall health anxiety, their fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19), and engagement in prevention behaviors. Consistent with previous research, individual differences in IU moderated the relationship between internet searches and FCV-19 such that for people high in IU, more internet searching was associated with greater fear. In turn, we also found that greater FCV-19 predicted more social-distancing behaviors. These findings are important in both future mental health and public health initiatives.","Baerg, Lindsay, Bruchmann, Kathryn","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103534","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Acta Psychologica;: 103534, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27270,""
"Forgotten frontline workers: Environmental health service employees' perspectives on working during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Environmental Health Service employees (EVS) sanitize healthcare facilities and are critical to preventing infection, but are under-resourced during the COVID-19 pandemic and at risk of burnout. Objective Understand demands on EVS? work and strain on resources during COVID-19. Design Qualitative descriptive study conducted in winter 2020?2021. Setting One quaternary care academic medical center in Colorado. Participants A convenience sample of 16 EVS out of 305 eligible at the medical center. Fifty percent identified as Black, 31% as Hispanic, 6% as Asian, and 6% as White (another 6% identified as mixed race). Sixty-nine percent were female, and half were born in a country outside the United States. Measures Semistructured telephone interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was used to identify key themes. Results Four themes illustrate EVS experiences with job strain and support during COVID-19: (1) Needs for ongoing training/education, (2) Emotional challenges of patient care, (3) Resource/staffing barriers, and (4) Lack of recognition as frontline responders. Despite feeling unrecognized during the pandemic, EVS identified structural supports with potential to mitigate job strain, including opportunities for increased communication with interdisciplinary colleagues, intentional acknowledgment, and education for those who speak languages other than English. Strategies that can increase physical and emotional resources and reduce job demands have potential to combat EVS burnout.

Prolonged periods of physical and social isolation because of such restrictions may have impacted heavily on adolescents? mental health and loneliness. Methods The current study addresses a major gap by examining the impact of school closures on the mental health and loneliness of 785, 10- to 17-year-old Western Australian adolescents (mean age?=?14.1, SD?=?1.31), who were surveyed across four time points: twice before COVID-19, once as schools closed, and once post reopening of schools. Pre- and post-COVID-19 changes in mental health and loneliness were compared using linear mixed models. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) assessed temporal associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and positive mental wellbeing. Results Compared with pre-COVID-19 symptom levels, there were significant increases in depression symptoms, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and a significant decrease in positive mental wellbeing at different points over time. Symptom change over time differed according to gender and pre-COVID-19 symptom severity. Significant increases in positive attitudes towards being alone and feelings of isolation occurred at different points over time. Gender differences were evident. RI-CLPMs highlighted the predictive significance of friendship quality and having a negative attitude towards being alone over time in relation to depression symptoms. A positive or negative attitude towards being alone was predictive of positive mental wellbeing over time. Conclusion Findings provide evidence that COVID-19-related school closures adversely affected adolescents' mental health and feelings of loneliness.","Houghton, Stephen, Kyron, Michael, Hunter, Simon C.; Lawrence, David, Hattie, John, Carroll, Annemaree, Zadow, Corinne","https://doi.org/10.1002/jad.12017","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Adolescence; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27272,""
"DEPRESSION AND ATTITUDES TO DEPRESSION AMONG STUDENTS OF A RUSSIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY DURING THE PANDEMIC CORONAVIRUS","The paper analyzes the attitude towards depression and the level of depression among medical students. Astrakhan State Medical University (Astrakhan, Russia) conducted a survey of students on their attitude towards depression, whether they consider depression a dangerous disease and whether they believe that it is necessary to consult a specialist in the presence of depression. The data of the depression level research and coping strategies among medical students are presented. In the course of study, it was found out that students know the symptoms of depression and the majority of them assess the effect of depression on their health correctly, however, they are not sufficiently informed about the treatment of depression and are biased against antidepressants. More symptoms of depression were diagnosed among junior students than that among senior ones. We identified that the students cannot adequately assess their mental condition and determine whether they have depression or not. It should be noted that students are practically not informed about such a disease as depression and it is necessary to carry out psychoeducational work with student youth.","Kostina, L.; Ibragimov, I.; Kubekova, A.; Sergeeva, M.","https://doi.org/10.35630/2199-885x/2021/11/6.3","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archiv Euromedica; 11(6):16-19, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27273,""

La clinique assure un suivi psychiatrique par le biais d'appels tÃ©lÃ©phoniques ou de vidÃ©oconfÃ©rences pour les patients qui ont Ã©tÃ© vus par l'Ã©quipe des PES. La travailleuse sociale joue un rÃ´le important au sein de l'Ã©quipe de la clinique virtuelle du PES : elle initie les Ã©valuations initiales, Ã©labore en collaboration des plans de suivi et facilite les soins de proximitÃ©. La clinique rÃ©pond au plan provincial visant Ã¢ rÃ©duire les visites aux services d'urgence, les temps d'attente aux services d'urgence/PES, l'engorgement des services d'urgence/PES et les admissions inappropriÃ©es, tout en rÃ©pondant Ã¢ la fois aux besoins psychiatriques et aux dÃ©terminants sociaux de la santÃ© dans un contexte de soins aigus. Lors de la recension des Ã©crits, nous avons trouvÃ© peu de recherches permettant d'informer la mise en Å“uvre des soins virtuels dans les services d'urgence canadiens (Hensel et coll., 2020;Serhal et coll., 2017).

The clinic provides psychiatric follow-up via scheduled phone calls or videoconference for patients that have been seen by the PES team. The social worker has an important role on the PES virtual clinic team: they initiate initial assessments, collaboratively develop follow-up plans, and facilitate community care. The clinic meets the provincial agenda to reduce Emergency Department (ED) visits, ED/PES wait times, ED/PES overcrowding, and inappropriate admissions, while addressing both psychiatric needs and social determinants of health in an acute care setting. Throughout our survey of relevant literature, we found little research to inform the implementation of virtual care in Canadian healthcare emergency services (Hensel et al., 2020;Serhal et al., 2017). More specifically, there is a void in research regarding a collaborative psychiatric and social work care model in the context of a global pandemic.

"Care for the chronically ill in Germany â€“ The challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is posing major challenges to the health care sector. This scoping review compiles evidence concerning changes to health care service availability and utilisation as well as possible impacts on health for selected groups of chronically ill people in Germany. The focus is on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and mental disorders. Most empirical data available concerned inpatient care and showed a clear decline in the utilisation of inpatient treatments in March and April 2020 in the areas of oncology and cardiology as well as in mental health. For cardiovascular emergencies such as heart attack and stroke, a decline was observed especially regarding less serious cases. Although there were indications of treatment delays, there was no evidence thus far that emergency care had been generally compromised due to adjustments to inpatient care capacities. In the outpatient setting, extensive adjustments to health care services availability were observed for all disease groups considered. Overall, very limited empirical data were available. In particular, hardly any data were available on how changes in care impacted population health. There is an urgent need for continuous surveillance and evaluation based on health care and epidemiological data.","Scheidt-Nave, Christa, Barnes, Benjamin, Beyer, Ann-Kristin, Busch, Markus A.; Hapke, Ulfert, Heidemann, Christin, Imhoff, Maren, Mumm, Rebekka, Paprott, Rebecca, Steppuhn, Henriette, von Berenberg-Gossler, Petra, Kraywinkel, Klaus","https://www.google.com/search?q=Care+for+the+chronically+ill+in+Germany+â€“+The+challenges+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of health monitoring; 5(Suppl 10):2-27, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27278,""
"Impact of the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic on French Health Students Impact de la premiÃ¨re vague de la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 sur les Ã©tudiants en santÃ© franÃ§ais","CONTEXT: In France, care workers and health students have been intensely mobilized during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. But few studies have evaluated psychological distress on non-medical health students, in addition to the challenges posed by pedagogical continuity while universities are closed following health and safety regulations. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess COVID-19's impact on health students in France on different levels: psychological, educational and social. METHODS: An online national cross-sectional study, from April 11 to May 30 2020, included sociodemographic, work conditions and numeric scales. RESULTS: 4411 students answered. Regarding the K6 scale, 39% of students had moderate distress, and 21% had a high level of distress. Risk factors of psychological distress included being a woman (p&lt;0.001), being between 19 and 21 years old (p&lt;0.001), living alone (p=0.008), and not having the ability to isolate (p&lt;0.001). Students on the frontline had less psychological distress (57 vs 62 %, p= 0.003), better quality of sleep (34% vs 28% high quality, p&lt;0.001) but a higher consumption of medical (8.5% vs 6.5%, p=0.044) and non-medical (18% vs 10%, p&lt;0.001) psychotropic drugs. Nurse and medical students had more distress and used more non-medical psychotropic substances than other health students (15% vs 9.2%). DISCUSSION: COVID-19' crisis had an important impact on health students' mental health, social life and training with discrepancies regarding the speciality whether they were on the frontline or not. There is an urgent need for psychological and pedagogical support for students, and even more so regarding the prolongation of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Rolland, Franck, Frajerman, Ariel, Falissard, Bruno, Bertschy, Gilles, Diquet, Bertrand, Marra, Donata","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+the+First+Wave+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+French+Health+Students+Impact+de+la+premiÃ¨re+vague+de+la+pandÃ©mie+de+COVID-19+sur+les+Ã©tudiants+en+santÃ©+franÃ§ais","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: L'Encephale;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27279,""
"Trends in Self-reported Forgone Medical Care Among Medicare Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Key Points Question How did forgone medical care among Medicare beneficiaries change during the COVID-19 pandemic? Findings In this cross-sectional survey study of 23 058 Medicare beneficiaries using 3 waves of data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic (Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Winter 2021), patient-reported forgone medical care decreased over time, but the largest decrease was observed in Summer 2020. Most of the forgone medical care was associated with physician-driven factors, and forgone medical care was more common among those who reported mental health problems. Meaning The study results suggest that Medicare beneficiaries experienced limited care access during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic but have improved care access over time. Importance Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative association with medical care access. As prior studies mainly focused on the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, less is known about how trends in forgone medical care changed over time. Objective To examine trends in and reasons for forgone medical care among Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study analyzed Medicare beneficiaries using data from 3 waves of survey data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement (Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Winter 2021). Data analyses were conducted between July and August 2021. Exposures Date of interview. Main Outcomes and Measures Self-reported forgone medical care because of COVID-19. Results A total of 23 058 Medicare beneficiaries were included (13 005 women [56.4%];10 445 [45.3%] 75 years old and older). The survey response rates for each wave were 72.6%, 78.95, and 79.6%, respectively. The rates of reported forgone medical care because of COVID-19 decreased from the week of June 7, 2020, to the week of April 4 to 25, 2021, but the largest difference in the rates was found between June 7 and July 12, 2020 (22.4% to 15.9%). Physician-driven factors accounted for about 70% of the forgone medical care. The proportion of those who reported forgoing medical care because of physician-driven factors tended to decrease from 66.2% in the week of July 7, 2020, to 44.7% in the weeks of April 4 to 25, 2021. The likelihood of forgone medical care was 4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.03-0.05) higher among those who reported feeling more stressed or anxious than those who did not, 3 percentage points (95% CI, 0.01-0.04) higher among those who reported feeling more lonely or sad than those who did not, and 3 percentage points (95% CI, 0.01-0.04) higher among those who reported feeling less socially connected than those who did not. Conclusions and Relevance The results of this cross-sectional survey study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate existing barriers to care and lead Medicare beneficiaries to delay needed care. Policy makers must continue to identify effective means of meeting the forgone care backlog and maintaining continuity of care, especially for those with mental health problems. This survey study examines trends in and reasons for forgone medical care because of COVID-19 among Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Park, Sungchul, Stimpson, Jim P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Trends+in+Self-reported+Forgone+Medical+Care+Among+Medicare+Beneficiaries+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: JAMA health forum; 2(12), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27280,""
"Burnout in Healthcare Professionals During the Covid-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Care University Hospital: Evaluation of the Need for Psychological Support: Turkish Journal of Psychiatry","Objective: Anxiety, stress and burnout are observed in healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and burnout and related risk factors in the healthcare workers and assistant personnel at a tertiary referral university hospital. Method: Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire were delivered on-line to all employees of our hospital. 683 individuals were to the study who completed and returned the forms between April 15-30, 2020. Results: Stress, depression and anxiety levels were significantly higher in nurses. Emotional burnout and depersonalization symptoms were higher and personal accomplishment scores were lower in resident physicians and nurses in comparison to the other groups. Being single, having a child and living away from home were factors underlying the burnout severity. Frontline work in the Covid-19 clinics did not affect the levels of anxiety, stress and depression. On the basis of the cut off points of the HADS scores;anxiety disorder (OR: 7.19) and depression (OR 3.43) were the most relevant risk factors for emotional exhaustion. Anxiety disorder was also the main risk factor for depersonalization. Depersonalization was 2.7-fold more among the nurses complaining of being overworked. Social support from the work environment and the family was protective against depersonalization. Conclusion: Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the wellbeing of healthcare workers. The presence of depression and anxiety increased the risk of burnout. Social support can be expected to protect against burnout. It is, therefore, of great importance to implement urgently effective psychosocial and organizational interventions in order to protect the mental health of healthcare workers and to prevent burnout.","Ã–zen Ã–nen, SertÃ¶z, TunÃ§el, Ã–zlem Kuman, SertÃ¶z, Nezih, Hepdurgun, Cenan, Damla I<U+0307>sman, Haznedaroglu, Bor, Canan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Burnout+in+Healthcare+Professionals+During+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+in+a+Tertiary+Care+University+Hospital:+Evaluation+of+the+Need+for+Psychological+Support:+Turkish+Journal+of+Psychiatry","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi; 32(2):75-86, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27281,""

"Caution Is Necessary When Estimating Treatment Need for Opioid Use Disorder Using National Surveys","Heroin use in particular is thought to be severely underestimated by NSDUH largely because heroin use is a rare and particularly stigmatized behavior concentrated in hard-to-reach populations, whereas NSDUH aims to assess drug use trends in the general population.6 NSDUH also does not include certain populations in its sampling frame that may be more likely to experience OUD, including unstably housed individuals not living in shelters and incarcerated individuals.6,7 In addition, as noted by Saini et al., NSDUH does not ask questions about illicitly manufactured fentanyl use- intentional use or unintentional use via exposure as an adulterant or contaminant in substances such as cocaine and methamphetamine.8 The exclusion of fentanyl, its analogs, and other new synthetic opioids (e.g., U-47700) from NSDUH is particularly troubling given the shifting overdose epidemic, with rapidly increasing fentanyl-involved fatal overdoses and declining nonprescription opioid- and heroin-involved fatal overdoses.8,9 The absence of measures of fentanyl and novel opioids might affect prevalence estimates of opioid use and OUD in the general population. [...]prevalence estimates of past-year opioid (mis)use may be underestimated in NSDUH, potentially biasing population estimates of OUD and associated treatment needs. Physicians in outpatient nonspecialty settings were authorized to prescribe buprenorphine after receipt of training and a waiver issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration with limits on the types of providers eligible to prescribe buprenorphine and the number of patients at a time to whom a provider could prescribe buprenorphine.10 Some of these strictures have been loosened to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 transmission (e.g., buprenorphine initiation via telehealth for new patients, 28-day medication supplies for established patients), but implementation of these policies across municipalities has been inconsistent.11 Understanding the prevalence of individual structural barriers to treatment access could have important implications for policy planning and expanded delivery of OUD treatment services.

"Role of the Telemental Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review: Turkish Journal of Psychiatry","Objective:: The COVID-19 pandemic has directed the use of telemedicine and digital mental health services to meet the needs of people in order to maintain physical distancing by preventing person to person contact. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of telemental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: An electronic search was carried out between January 01, 2020 and October 31, 2020 to explore the utilization of telehealth services for mental health problems among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary source of literature was the structured search of major electronic databases from the MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL Plus, Science Direct and the Web of Science. We included nine published studies meeting the the eligibility criteria. Results: The role of telehealth identified in this review mainly focused on the applicability of this modality for assessing and managing various mental health problems in these unprecedented times. It also pointed out that the provision of telemental health support reduced the burden of mental health diseases and promoted the wellbeing of the individual. Further, it was witnessed that patients preferred remote consultation as compared to face-to-face visits in order to avoid contracting the virus and found online mental health interventions and psychological counseling very helpful to cope up with the current crisis. Conclusion: The current COVID-19 lockdown has changed the management of the mental health problems of patients.

"Developing a mental health index using a machine learning approach: Assessing the impact of mobility and lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic","Governments worldwide have implemented stringent restrictions to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although beneficial to physical health, these preventive measures could have a profound detrimental effect on the mental health of the population. This study focuses on the impact of lockdowns and mobility restrictions on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We first develop a novel mental health index based on the analysis of data from over three million global tweets using the Microsoft Azure machine learning approach. The computed mental health index scores are then regressed with the lockdown strictness index and Google mobility index using fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The results reveal that the reduction in workplace mobility, reduction in retail and recreational mobility, and increase in residential mobility (confinement to the residence) have harmed mental health. However, restrictions on mobility to parks, grocery stores, and pharmacy outlets were found to have no significant impact. The proposed mental health index provides a path for theoretical and empirical mental health studies using social media.","Nanath, Krishnadas, Balasubramanian, Sreejith, Shukla, Vinaya, Islam, Nazrul, Kaitheri, Supriya","https://www.google.com/search?q=Developing+a+mental+health+index+using+a+machine+learning+approach:+Assessing+the+impact+of+mobility+and+lockdown+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Technological forecasting and social change;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27285,""

Les indicateurs de mauvaise santÃ© mentale incluent la frÃ©quence Ã¢ laquelle les rÃ©pondants se sont sentis tristes, stressÃ©s, confus, isolÃ©s, impuissants, nerveux, dÃ©sespÃ©rÃ©s ou dÃ©primÃ© pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19. L'analyse multivariÃ©e souligne l'importance de la rÃ©silience et de la densitÃ© familiale (le nombre de freres et sÅ“urs) pour la diminution des problemes de santÃ© mentale, cependant que l'insÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire et la durÃ©e de rÃ©sidence au Canada ont accru la mauvaise santÃ© mentale. Parmi ces facteurs, l'insÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire suivie par la rÃ©silience Ã©taient les prÃ©dicteurs les plus forts de la santÃ© mentale des jeunes rÃ©fugiÃ©s et immigrants.Alternate :In this paper, we examine how the degree of newcomer youth assimilation and acculturation, food insecurity, resilience, and social connections affect the mental health of recent refugee and immigrant youth in a mid-sized city during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data for this study are based on a sample of newcomers, mostly refugees, surveyed between July and November 2020. Indicators of mental health problems include the frequency in which respondents felt sad, stressed, confused, isolated, helpless, nervous, hopeless, or depressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis points to the importance of resiliency and family density (i.e., number of siblings) for decreasing mental health problems, while food insecurity and length of residency in Canada increased them. Among these, food insecurity followed by resiliency were the strongest predictors of refugee and immigrant youth's mental health.","Nakhaie, Reza, Ramos, Howard, Vosoughi, Dara, Baghdadi, Obada","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+of+Newcomer+Refugee+and+Immigrant+Youth+During+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Ethnic Studies; 54(1):1-28, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27287,""
"Understanding the lived experiences of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: an interpretative phenomenological analysis Comprendiendo las experiencias vividas de los profesionales de la salud durante la pandemia de COVID-19: un anÃ¡lisis fenomenolÃ³gico interpretativo <U+4E86><U+89E3>COVID-19<U+75AB><U+60C5><U+671F><U+95F4><U+533B><U+62A4><U+4EBA><U+5458><U+7684><U+4EB2><U+8EAB><U+7ECF><U+5386>:<U+4E00><U+9879><U+89E3><U+91CA><U+6027><U+73B0><U+8C61><U+5B66><U+5206><U+6790>","Background: Little research has examined the impact of working within the context of COVID-19 on UK healthcare professionals (HCPs) mental health and well-being, despite previous pandemic findings indicating that HCPs are particularly vulnerable to suffering PTSD and other mental health difficulties due to the nature of healthcare work. Specifically, it appears that no research has employed qualitative methodologies to explore the effects of working amidst COVID-19 on mental health for HCPs in the UK. Objective: To qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one centred on specific challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic, such as redeployment, isolation from loved ones, infection concerns, lack of PPE and impact on patient interpersonal care. Theme two offered insights into the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs, while many experienced feelings of fear, sadness and hypervigilance, all also demonstrated a marked resilience. Finally, many felt undervalued and misunderstood, and wished to press upon the general public seriousness of the disease. Conclusion: To the authorsâ€™ knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort. HIGHLIGHTS The current study qualitatively examines the experiences of frontline healthcare professionals working during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes emerged from the analysis, broadly covering key areas such as navigating new occupational challenges, maintaining mental health and wellbeing under precedented circumstances, and managing feelings being misunderstood and undervalued. Specific challenges included sudden redeployment, resulting often in a change in job role (and/or location) as well as a loss of important work related social networks because of this, isolation from loved ones, infection concerns, lack of (or limited supply of) personal protection equipment and impact on patient interpersonal care. The findings suggest that being a healthcare professional during this time does not come without personal cost and has the potential to put pressure on oneâ€™s psychological state, with many participants experienced feelings of fear, sadness and hypervigilance, as well as physical exhaustion. All participants demonstrated a marked resilience in their ability to continue to do navigate their work environment and were able to employ adaptive coping strategies however, some expressed concern that this is waning. It is essential that we do not neglect a workforce which is working tirelessly at great personal cost to keep each one of us safe and support the continued wellbeing and resilience of healthcare professionals. It is argued that in order to adequately support healthcare professionals physical and mental health we must tackle this on three main fronts, at a Government level, a research and intervention level and at a societal level.","McGlinchey, Emily, Hitch, Catherine, Butter, Sarah, McCaughey, Laura, Berry, Emma, Armour, Cherie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Understanding+the+lived+experiences+of+healthcare+professionals+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+an+interpretative+phenomenological+analysis+Comprendiendo+las+experiencias+vividas+de+los+profesionales+de+la+salud+durante+la+pandemia+de+COVID-19:+un+anÃ¡lisis+fenomenolÃ³gico+interpretativo+<U+4E86><U+89E3>COVID-19<U+75AB><U+60C5><U+671F><U+95F4><U+533B><U+62A4><U+4EBA><U+5458><U+7684><U+4EB2><U+8EAB><U+7ECF><U+5386>:<U+4E00><U+9879><U+89E3><U+91CA><U+6027><U+73B0><U+8C61><U+5B66><U+5206><U+6790>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 12(1), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27288,""
"Enhancing the STEM Framework","As Manak and Puig write this article amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they are more aware than ever of the overlapping and interconnected nature of science, literacy, and real-world issues. This pandemic is not simply a problem to be solved by expertise in any one discipline but necessitates a transdisciplinary approach requiring the integration of many fields including biology, virology, economics, politics, engineering, education, and psychology. As they adapt instruction to educate students and support social-emotional learning, we must collaboratively seek new solutions to these dynamic, real-word issues in our global society. We propose building on the STEM acronym (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) with Stamina, Transdisciplinarity, Engagement, and Mindfulness crosscutting STEM subjects to foster students' acceleration of critical thinking of disciplinary practices across core ideas. Within the concept of three-dimensional learning, they situate stamina, transdisciplinarity, engagement, and mindfulness as a framework for enhancing instruction across the disciplines to engineer solutions to real-world issues.","Manak, Jennifer A.; Puig, Enrique A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Enhancing+the+STEM+Framework","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Science and Children; 58(6):82-85, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27289,""

"The Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Turkish Journal of Psychiatry","Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the anxiety, depression, insomnia and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and the assocaited sociodemographic, clinical and professional factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthhcare workers. Method: A total of 509 participants joined an online survey to complete the data acquisition tools consisting of a Sociodemographic and Clinical Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder- Short Scale (PTSD-SS). Results: The 509 participants of the study consisted of physicians (69.2%) and nurses (30.8%). On the basis of the scores above the cut-off points of the pscyhometric scales used, the mental symptoms of the participants were ranked as 54.2% on depression, 26.3% on anxiety, 20.8% on insomnia and 8.8% on PTSD. The corresponding scores of the 20-30 year old, the female and the nursing participants were significantly higher as compared to the others (p&lt;0.001, for all). Significant differences were not found in these scores with respect to working or not working directly with COVID-19 patients, or having a family member with or without COVID-19 infection (p&gt;0.05). Having a history of suspected COVID-19 infection was significantly associated with insomnia (p=0.026 and PTSD (p=0.008). Also, the anxiety and PTSD scores of the participants with a history of mental disorder diagnosis were significantly higher in comparison to the others (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The results indicated that females, nurses, participants in the 20-30 year age group and with a history of mental disorder diagnosis were in the high risk group for impaired mental health, irrespective of their professional positions.

"IMPACT OF COVID-19 OUTBREAK ON PATIENTS' CLINICAL APPOINTMENTS, ANXIETY AND CONCERNS REGARDING ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT","COVID-19 pandemic has affected social, personal and mental health of the people all over the world. Hence, this study aimed to assess the level of anxiety and concerns of orthodontic patients regarding Covid-19 pandemic and to determine the impact of quarantine on orthodontic appointments and treatment duration. Online Questionnaire related to COVID-19 was sent to orthodontic patients. Comparisons between level of anxiety and willingness to attend orthodontic treatment and respecting quarantine were performed using independent t test, Chi square, One-way ANOVA and Tukey test. Additionally, gender-based comparisons were also made. Spearmen correlation coefficient analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between age and level of anxiety. 200 patients (females 136, males 64) participants responded to the questionnaire with the age range of 18.87 Â± 8. 012 years. Most of the patients were respecting quarantine. Generally, (44.3%) patients were calm about the COVID-19. As compared to females, males were more willing to attend orthodontic appointment although their anxiety level was slightly higher related to the impact on orthodontic treatment. There was an insignificant association between the anxiety levels and willingness for appointments, respecting quarantine and age. Delay in orthodontic treatment duration was one of the greatest concerns shown by the patients. COVID-19 Pandemic has influenced the orthodontic treatment but also the patient's anxiety levels. Males were more anxious related to the impact of COVID-19 on orthodontic treatment. Patients willing to attend orthodontic appointments in emergency showed higher levels of anxiety.

"Letter to the Editor: THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS: Turkish Journal of Psychiatry","Dear Editor, The Covid-19 pandemic affected human life globally, inducing much stress on daily living (Ã‡akiroglu et al. 2020). Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004;Dinan et al., 2004;Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020). Therefore, this survey has been organised to evaluate the reaction developed by schizophrenia patients to the pandemic conditions. The first Covid-19 case was reported in Turkey on 11 March 2020 (Anadolu Agency, 11.03.2020) which was followed by the gradual increase in case numbers. In order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and maintain the existing public health, the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health established a â€˜Scientific Committeeâ€™â€™ and prepared effective strategies including social isolation, quarantine, school closures, social distancing and wearing face mask in the community. During this process, the approximately 250 schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients followed up by the Psychosis Outpatient Unit of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital Psychiatry Department (DEUPD) were instructed to visit the outpatient unit only in emergency conditions. It was determined that there were 176 schizophrenia patients whose follow up visit appointments for the period of April 1 - June 22, 2020, scheduled before the announcement of the pandemic, were cancelled. Therefore, the survey reported here was conducted with the schizophrenia patients of the DEUPD online and by telephone connections during 10- 20 May, 2020, the 9th and the 10th weeks of the pandemic. Only 76 (43.19%) of the 176 patients joined the survey, since 4 (2.27%) refused to participate and 96 (54.4%) could not be contacted. The survey aimed to determine the incidence of Covid-19 diagnosis among these schizophrenia patients and their attitude to the preventive measures against the infection during the first 2 months of the pandemic, together with how they felt and their needs for psychiatric consultation on outpatient basis during this period. The surveyed 76 patients consisted of 49 (64%) males and 27 (35%) females, with 73 (96.1%) dwelling in urban and 3 (3.9%) in suburban areas;and only 11 (14.5%) employed while 65 (85.5%) were not working. Only two patients reported consulting emergency services for Covid-19 symptoms. The rest of the patients did not report consulting a healthcare facility for suspecting Covid-19 symptoms or Table 1. Data on the demographic, clinical and social features of the schizophrenia patients during the COVID-19 pandemic n=76 Mean SD Gender (F/M) 27 (35.5%) / 49 (64.5%) Age 44.54 12.21 Disease duration 16.62 9.96 Patients living /with Alone 3 (3.9%) Parent(s) 43 (56.6%) Spouse/children 25 (32.9%) Sibling (s) 1 (1.3%) Relative(s) 2 (2.6%) Friend(s) 2 (2.6%) Yes No Need to see a psychiatrist 23 (30.3%) 53 (69.7%) Subjective psychiatric complaints 32 (42.1%) 44 (57.9%) Consultation with an emergency service 2 ( .6%) 74 (97.4%) Planning to go to the hospital in the post-quarantine period 58 (76.3%) 18 (23.7%) Wearing a mask in community 67 (88.2%) 4 (5.3%) Keeping social distancing 68 (89.5%) 3 (3.9%) Expressed feeling Loneliness 26 (34.2%) 49 (64.5%) Depressed 31 (40.8%) 44 (57.9%) Despaired 22 (28.9%) 52 (68.4%) Anxious 25 (32.9%) 49 (64.5%) Difficulty of going to the hospital in the quarantine period 53 (69.7%) 23 (30.3%) hospital admission for Covid-19 infection or psychotic attack or incidences of Covid-19 related hallucination or delusions. During this 2-month period, 4 patients had experienced fatigue, 2 had episodes of dry cough and 7 had experienced shortness of breath, which can be associated with the nature of schizophrenia, the sedentary life style.and cigarette smoking. Medication was prescribed by a psychiatrist for 10 patients and by a family doctor for 16 patients or supplied directly by pharmacies for 45 patients on the basis of prescriptions with 1-year validity issued by the hospital* (Table 1). Much as it had been aimed to contact all patients with cancelled appointments, this objective was not attainable The patients who were not reached are likely to include those with low awareness and difficulty of adapting to infection prevention strategies. On the other hand, regardless of the level of awareness of the pandemic and compliance with the rules, phone use by these patients might have been limited by economic and environmental reasons, as well as the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. In conclusion, it is possible to say that most of the patients with schizophrenia were aware of the risk of COVID-19 infection, and understood and mostly obeyed the general health rules and advices of healthcare professionals even if they had difficulty in doing so. This could also have resulted from the nature of schizophrenia with preference for social isolation even if this can worsen the prognosis. On the other hand, patients need to be in contact with a mental healthcare professional in extraordinary situations of a pandemic. This survey did not find a remarkable increase in positive symptom severity in association with COVID-19 as most patients included in the survey had not seen a psychiatrist or mental healthcare professional for two months with 53 patients stating that they did not have to need. However, 58 patients also stated that despite planning to make a consultation after normalization of the quarantine measures, the anxiety of contagion outweighed the option of visiting outpatient clinics. This anxiety over Covid-19 infection, however, may make it difficult for patients to understand the level of the need to see a psychiatrist and may be associated with the assumption that the pandemic would be taken under control in the normalization process with a decrease in the risk of contagion. On the results of this survey, it may be concluded that strategies for prevention of COVID-19 spread were effective among schizophrenia patients and that there is need to develop a system that reaches all patients and keeps them socially connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. *In Turkey, prescription reports with 1-year validity are issued for patients with chronic disorders. The medications can only be prescribed by a specialist, and in the case of pyshchiatric disorders, by a consultant psychiatrist. When the report is confirmed by a hospital committee of specialists, a family doctor is able to issue prescriptions. According to the decision of the Ministry of Health, patients who have medication prescription reports valid for one year would be able to get their medicines directly from pharmacies without having to consult a psychiatrist or family doctor during the pandemic.

"'Constrained mobility': a feature of protracted displacement in Greece and Italy","Protracted displacement is often implicitly associated with passivity and immobility, and it is not by chance that protracted displacement is often described through the metaphor of 'limbo'. But people living in protracted displacement are far from immobile. On the contrary, both in their everyday lives and over time, they experience 'constrained mobility' at different scales and in pursuit of different goals. While heavily constrained by a complex and constantly evolving combination of legal and socioeconomic factors, these mobility patterns are a crucial form of 'agency under duress'. Here, Roman et al use the cases of Greece and Italy to explore what protracted displacement looks like in reality. These countries share at least three common structural features. First, both are 'first entry' countries in the European Union (EU), where asylum seekers' mobility is constrained by Dublin Regulation rules. Second, both countries have comparatively low administrative capacity, in particular in the fields of reception and integration of asylum seekers and refugees. Finally they are both characterized by stagnant official labor markets and sizeable underground economies. All of these factors deeply shape the patterns of mobility and inclusion/exclusion of migrants living in protracted displacement.","Hatziprokopiou, Panos, Papatzani, Evangelia, Pastore, Ferruccio, Roman, Emanuela","https://www.google.com/search?q='Constrained+mobility':+a+feature+of+protracted+displacement+in+Greece+and+Italy","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Forced Migration Review; - (68):59-62, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27294,""

"Psychological and workplace-related effects of providing surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia, Canada","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been an uncertain, challenging time that has placed numerous strains on the Canadian health care system. A crucial yet sometimes overlooked aspect of this has been the mental health impact on health care workers. Surgeons, in particular, have faced unique stressors because of the cancellation of elective procedures, uncertainty regarding future management of urgent patient conditions such as oncologic operative procedures, and fear of infectious transmission to family and friends because of exposure from aerosolgenerating procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgeons mental health across British Columbia, Canada. Methods: An online survey was distributed to BC general surgeons to gather demographic and mental health data related to the pandemic period, including 2 validated burnout and psychological distress tools, the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Results: Sixty-three of 198 surgeons (32%) across BC responded to the survey;44% and 59% felt that the pandemic negatively affected their job performance and personal relationships outside the hospital, respectively. In addition, 64% felt more stress or anxiety because of decreased access to operating rooms. From the aMBI results, 33% of surgeons felt emotionally exhausted from work, and the average K10 score was consistent with moderate psychological distress. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected general surgeons mental health across BC, both professionally and personally. This should be acknowledged by hospital leaders with specific efforts to mitigate the short- and long-term impacts on surgeons well-being.","D'Souza, K.; Huynh, C.; Cadili, L.; Ling, J.; Warburton, R.; Hwang, H.; Hameed, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+and+workplace-related+effects+of+providing+surgical+care+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+British+Columbia,+Canada","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Surgery; 64, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27297,""
"Changes in Short-term, Long-term, and Preventive Care Delivery in US Office-Based and Telemedicine Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Key Points Question Has the COVID-19 pandemic been associated with any changes in the clinical content of ambulatory care in the US? Findings In this cross-sectional study of serial data from the IQVIA National Disease and Therapeutic Index, there was a moderate rebound in office-based care during the second half of 2020, while telemedicine accounted for 23.9% of care observed. Office-based care during the pandemic (quarters 2-4 of 2020) involved 58.0% long-term, 23.0% short-term, and 25.6% preventive diagnoses, while telemedicine care involved substantially greater long-term (77.2%), modestly greater short-term (26.8%), and almost no preventive (2.7%) diagnoses. Meaning In contrast to office-based care, telemedicine was more commonly used for established patients and substantially greater delivery of psychiatric or behavioral treatments than preventive care. Importance While the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with some substitution of telemedicine for office-based care in the US, to our knowledge, little is known regarding the pandemicâ€™s association with the clinical content of ambulatory care. Objective To characterize changes in the clinical content of ambulatory care among office-based vs telemedicine encounters in the US before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Settings, and Participants This analysis of serial cross-sectional data from the IQVIA National Disease and Therapeutic Index was a 2-stage, stratified nationally representative audit of outpatient care in the US from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020. The National Disease and Therapeutic Index generates approximately 33 617 quarterly visits that are projected to 306.7 million national visits based on the survey design. Main Outcomes and Measures (1) Prevalence of common diagnoses and (2) mix of long-term, short-term, and preventive care. Results The mean (SD) number of projected quarterly, in-person, office-based visits was 282.1 (1.4) million in 2018 and 284.7 (10.3) in 2019 before declining to 250.8 million in quarter 1 of 2020 and 147.8 million in quarter 2 of 2020 and then increasing moderately to 181.5 million in quarter 3 of 2020 and 180.2 million in quarter 4 of 2020. The mean (SD) number of telemedicine visits was 2.8 (0.4) million in 2018 and 3.0 (0.1) million in 2019 before increasing to 8.6 million in quarter 1 of 2020 and 72.2 million in quarter 2 of 2020 and then declining notably to 43.8 million in quarter 3 of 2020 and 44.2 million in quarter 4 of 2020. Office-based care during the second through fourth quarters of 2020 involved 58.0% long-term, 23.0% short-term, and 25.6% preventive care. In contrast to office-based care, 4 of the top 10 diagnoses that were treated by telemedicine during 2020 were for psychiatric or behavioral conditions: depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Throughout this period, approximately half of office-based visits and nearly two-thirds of telemedicine visits were for established rather than new patients. Conclusions and Relevance This cross-sectional studyâ€™s findings suggest that while telemedicine rapidly increased early during course of the COVID-19 pandemic, its use declined modestly since then. In contrast to office-based care, telemedicine was more commonly used for established patients and substantially greater delivery of psychiatric or behavioral treatments rather than preventive care. This cross-sectional study of data from the IQVIA National Disease and Therapeutic Index examines changes in the clinical content of ambulatory care among office-based vs telemedicine encounters in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cortez, Cecilia, Mansour, Omar, Qato, Dima M.; Stafford, Randall S.; Alexander, G.

"Social Distancing, Psychological Mood and Physical Activity Behavior During COVID-19 in the United States","Social distancing, during previous epidemics, has been shown to lead to poor mental health outcomes and reduced physical activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships between self-reported psychological state and physical activity behaviors of individuals under social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. 199 individuals (29.85 Â± 10.22 yrs) in the United States who had been in social distancing for 2-4 weeks participated in this study. Participants answered a questionnaire regarding feelings of loneliness, depression, anxiety, mood state, and physical activity. 66.8% of participants had depressive symptoms and 72.8% had symptoms of anxiety. Loneliness was correlated with depression (r = 0.66), trait anxiety (r = 0.36), fatigue (r = 0.38), confusion (r = 0.39), and total mood disturbance (TMD;r = 0.62). Participation in total physical activity was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (r = -0.16) and TMD (r = -0.16). State anxiety was positively associated with participation in total physical activity (r = 0.22). In addition, a binomial logistic regression was performed to predict participation in sufficient physical activity. The model explained 45% of the variance in physical activity participation and correctly categorized 77% of cases. Individuals with higher vigor scores had an increased likelihood of participating in sufficient physical activity. Loneliness was associated with negative psychological mood state. Individuals with higher feelings of loneliness, depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and negative mood state were observed to spend less time engaged in physical activity. Higher state anxiety was positively associated with engagement in physical activity.","Chesbro, Grant A.; Peterson, Jessica A.; Black, Christopher D.; Larson, Daniel J.; Larson, Rebecca D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+Distancing,+Psychological+Mood+and+Physical+Activity+Behavior+During+COVID-19+in+the+United+States","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Exercise Science; 15(5):313, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27299,""
"Significant factors associated with problematic use of opioid pain relief medications among the household population, Canada, 2018","Background Reliance on the use of opioids to manage pain has increased over time, as have opioid-related morbidity and deaths. In 2018, 12.7% of Canadians reported having used opioid pain relief medications (OPRMs) in the previous year. Among these people, 9.6% had engaged in problematic use that could cause harm to their health. Though socioeconomic characteristics associated with opioid-related harms have previously been reported, population-level evidence based on administrative health data lacks important behavioural and psychosocial information. This analysis extends previous research by using modelling to report factors related to the problematic use of OPRMs for the household population aged 15 and older in Canada. Data and methods This analysis uses responses to the 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey to identify factors that are significantly associated, after adjustment using multivariate logistic regression models, with elevated odds of problematic use of OPRMs. Results The fully adjusted model confirmed that being male, being younger (ages 20 to 24), having fair or poor mental health, having unmet needs for help with mental or emotional health or substance problems, being a smoker, or being unattached and living with others were significantly related to problematic OPRM use. Interpretation Subjective perceptions significantly related to problematic OPRM use, independent of socioeconomic circumstances, were examined in this study. While previous research based on administrative health data has contributed much to knowledge about factors associated with opioid harms, modelled results revealed that self-reported experiential factors also warrant consideration as they are significantly associated with problematic use. Having fair or poor mental health, having unmet perceived needs for help, and being unattached in terms of household arrangement relationship were related to problematic use of OPRMs, even after adjustment for socioeconomic and other health covariates. This study suggests risk profiles that could be used to inform health care providers, and strategies to support safe pain management.","Carriere, Gisele, Garner, Rochelle, SanmartÃ­n, Claudia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Significant+factors+associated+with+problematic+use+of+opioid+pain+relief+medications+among+the+household+population,+Canada,+2018","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Reports; 32(12):11-26, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27300,""

"Nightmaresâ€™ Pattern and Predictors among a Saudi University Students during COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic quarantine, university students were under various types of stressors, including the exams period, which might have affected their quality and quantity of sleep, and consequently, their quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the pattern and predictors of nightmares among university students and coinvestigate the presence of other types of sleep disturbances, mental disorders, and quarantine-related stressors. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 368 university students who answered a self-completed questionnaire covering their sociodemographic features, nightmare indicators, and associated quarantine stressors. Additionally, sleep disturbances were measured using the Generalized Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2 scale, and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Results: The participantsâ€™ mean age was 20.4 Â± 1.6 years, and male participants represented 35.9% of the sample. Nightmares were experienced by 117 (31.8%) of the participants, of whom 44.4% had new-onset nightmares. The mean GSDS was 45.0 Â± 14.9 (min. = 12, max. = 130). This value is associated with elevated odds of the following outcomes: the presence of nightmares (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8;confidence interval [CI] 95% = 1.1â€“3.0);new-onset nightmares at the time of pandemic (OR = 2.6;CI 95% = 1.3â€“5.5);and anxiety (OR = 1.74;CI 95% = 1.0â€“2.9). The presence of nightmares elevated the score of GSDS by 11.3 points (S.E. = 1.6, p &lt; 0.001), elevated the odds of anxiety by 4.1 (CI 95% = 2.5â€“6.8), and depression by 2.1 (CI 95% = 1.3â€“3.4). Conclusions: Stressors resulting from both the exams period and the fact that it was conducted during COVID-19 quarantine increased the rate and affected the pattern of nightmares. These stressors also led to other sleep disturbances and mental disorders that were significantly more prevalent among females.","Alghamdi, Amal A.; Alafif, Nora O.; BaHammam, Ahmed S.; Almuammar, May, Alharbi, Najd S.; Alhefdhi, Nouf A.; Al-Musharaf, Sara, Al Ghamdi, Kholoud S.; AlYousif, Ghada F.; Al Muhanna, Norah F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Nightmaresâ€™+Pattern+and+Predictors+among+a+Saudi+University+Students+during+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: International journal of environmental research and public health; 19(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27306,""
"The Attitude, Perception, and Mental Health of Patients Receiving Orthodontic Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced dental clinics to shut down indefinitely, leaving thousands of orthodontic patients in unending fear and dismay. The study aimed to assess the attitude, perceptions and mental health status of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment in Saudi Arabia during the lockdown. A cross-sectional study was conducted among orthodontic patients of different clinics across Saudi Arabia and selected using two-stage clustered sampling. A validated Arabic questionnaire comprising four sections including demographic data, patients' interactions, attitude and perception, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was sent via digital means. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied with the level of significance set to p&lt;0.05. A total of 512 orthodontic patients voluntarily participated in the study. Eighty-four percent of the patients contacted their orthodontist once or twice during this period, 22% percent did not receive any communication from their orthodontist, 18% were very worried about not being able to continue their treatment, 72% were concerned about the treatment durationÃ‚Â increasing post lockdown, 18% suffered cuts or lacerations due to their appliance, and 32% had poking wires. Seventy-six percent of patients were willing to visit a clinic post lockdown only with proper preventive measures in place. A mild level of mental distress (22.76 Ã‚Â± 8.69) was reported using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Female orthodontic patients &gt;25 years of age with &gt;1 year of ongoing treatment were associated with higher levels of mental distress. The current pandemic has impacted the mental health status of orthodontic patients in some form or another. Older females with longer treatment times were more affected by the lockdown. The lack of effective communication from the orthodontist led to some negative perceptions about their treatment.","Alassiry, Hakami","https://doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S348933","20220221","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; attitude; mental health; orthodontics; perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27307,""

"Prioritising women's and girls' health in disaster settings: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and the overlapping crises affecting Beirut, Lebanon","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed strain on healthcare systems across the world; however, countries experiencing overlapping crises such as economic or political unrest face immense pressure in ensuring routine healthcare services can continue to operate. Despite being less likely suffer severe disease or die from COVID-19, data suggest women have experienced poorer mental health, higher rates of unemployment, and more social isolation during the pandemic. In general, we know women and girls experience multiple forms of disadvantage in disaster contexts including being more likely to become homeless, work as an unpaid carer, and to experience poverty. Research from previous disaster contexts has demonstrated that women's healthcare services tend to be deprioritised in the emergency response, and reports suggest this has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Exploring Deeper Causes Linking Adolescents' Mental Disorders to Mobile Phone Use Problems: Grounded Theory Approach","Evidence from a variety of studies link mobile phone use with an increase in mental health problems, with the situation being particularly prevalent in China and exacerbated by the COVID-19 quarantine. This study aims to reveal underlying connections between mobile phone use and mental disorders of adolescents, and to develop a theory to help parents and counseling psychologists better understand and intervene in future cases. A total of 37 teenagers having both mental health and mobile phone use problems, along with their parents, were included for individual interviews. These interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using qualitative methods of grounded theory. The grades-ranking-first mentality is one of the main factors causing problems such as defective family bonding and peer influences, pushing teenagers with mental disorders to seek comfort in the virtual world through their cellphones. The idea proposed in this study is not only inspiring for psychological counseling and therapy on adolescents with mental problems but also beneficial for school educators and parents to better understand the adolescents. The findings of the study are also particularly noteworthy in the postpandemic age, where parents whose work locations and schedules are substantially affected due to any emergencies should try to build a relaxing and cozy atmosphere at home to avoid possible conflicts with adolescents.","Sun, Zhou, Zhang, Gui, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2196/31089","20220221","adolescent health; mental disorder; mobile phone use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27310,""
"Guilt, tears and burnout-Impact of UK care home restrictions on the mental well-being of staff, families and residents","The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the pandemic on the emotional and mental well-being of family carers, care home staff and residents, in light of changing restrictions, increased testing and vaccination rollout in the UK. Longitudinal, qualitative semi-structured interview study. Remote semi-structured interviews were conducted with family carers of care home residents with dementia and care home staff from different care homes across the UK. Baseline and follow-up interviews were conducted in October/November 2020 and March 2021, respectively. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis involving members of the public with caring experiences. In all, 42 family carers and care home staff participated at baseline, with 20 family carers and staff followed up. We identified four themes: (1) Developing anger and frustration; (2) Impact on relationships; (3) Stress and burnout; and (4) Behavioural changes, and perceived impact on residents. The mental health of everyone involved, including family carers, care home staff and residents, has been negatively affected, and relationships between family carers and staff have been severely strained. There was a general lack of adequate mental health support, with little relief. The pandemic has had a detrimental impact on the lives of those surrounding care homes-from residents and staff to family carers. Consideration should be given on how to best support the mental health needs of all three groups, by providing adequate easily accessible mental health care for all. This should also focus on rebuilding the relationships between family carers and care home staff. This is the first paper to highlight the effects of the long-lasting and miscommunicated restrictions on residents, carers and care home staff, and highlight the urgent need for continued mental health support.","Giebel, Hanna, Marlow, Cannon, Tetlow, Shenton, Faulkner, Rajagopal, Mason, Gabbay","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15181","20220221","COVID-19; care homes; carers; long-term care; mental health; nursing; nursing homes; staff well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27311,""

"Worsening Pain and Quality of Life for Spine Surgery Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Roles of Psychological Distress and Patient Activation","Public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted access to basic resources (income, food, housing, healthcare). The effects may impact patients differently based on socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing psychological distress, and patient activation (knowledge, skills, and motivation to manage healthcare). We examined changes in access to basic resources and in pain and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the pandemic and determined how pre-existing psychological distress and patient activation are associated with exacerbation or mitigation of effects on pain and HRQoL. This cross-sectional study assessed 431 patients in a longitudinal-outcomes registry who underwent or scheduled spine surgery at our institution and were surveyed about COVID-19 effects on accessing basic resources. We assessed pain (numeric rating scale) and HRQoL (PROMIS 29-Item Profile). Information on preoperative SES, psychological distress, patient activation, pain, and HRQoL was collected previously. We compared access to basic resources by SES. We compared changes from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 assessments of pain and HRQoL and proportions of patients reporting worsened pain and HRQoL stratified by psychological distress. We analyzed associations between patient activation and negative effects on HRQoL using multivariable linear regression. Alpha=0.05. Respondents reported minor disruptions in accessing basic resources (no difference by SES) but significant worsening of back (p=.027) and leg pain (p=.013) and HRQoL (physical function, fatigue, p&lt;0.001; satisfaction with participation in social roles, p=0.048) during COVID-19. Psychological distress was associated with clinically relevant worsening of back, pain, leg pain, and physical function all, (p&lt;0.05). High patient activation was associated with less impairment of physical function (p=0.03). Patients with pre-existing psychological distress experienced greater worsening of pain and HRQoL. High patient activation appeared to mitigate worsening of physical function. Providers should screen for psychological distress and patient activation and enhance supports to manage pain and maintain HRQoL in at-risk patients.<b>Level of Evidence:</b> III.","Bronheim, Kebaish, Jain, Neuman, Skolasky","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xnsj.2022.100103","20220221","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; patient activation; patient-reported outcomes; spine surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27313,""

An 18-question survey was administered in June 2020 at a New York City-based cancer center to assess the quality of life (QOL) and overall health (OH) during both the pandemic time period from March 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020, and the pre-pandemic period (prior to March 1, 2020). Survey questions were answered on a 5-point Likert scale and a 7-point EORTC <i>QLQ-C30</i> QOL scale. Differences in mean QOL and OH scores were evaluated using a paired <i>t</i>-test. QOL and OH were significantly worsened by the pandemic, with significant increases in anxiety, depression, and mood swings.","Berger, Zimmerman, Seidman, Cascetta, Moshier, Nezolosky, Trlica, Ryncarz, Keeton, Tiersten","https://doi.org/10.1177/23743735221077543","20220221","COVID-19; Telehealth; breast cancer; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27314,""
"Digital Media Use and Adolescents' Mental Health During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The Covid-19 physical distancing measures had a detrimental effect on adolescents' mental health. Adolescents worldwide alleviated the negative experiences of social distancing by spending more time on digital devices. Through a systematic literature search in eight academic databases (including Eric, Proquest Sociology, Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Pubmed, and Web of Science), the present systematic review and meta-analysis first summarized the existing evidence from 30 studies, published up to September 2021, on the link between mental health and digital media use in adolescents during Covid-19. Digital media use measures included social media, screen time, and digital media addiction. Mental health measures were grouped into conceptually similar dimensions, such as well-being, ill-being, social well-being, lifestyle habits, and Covid-19-related stress. Results showed that, although most studies reported a positive association between ill-being and social media use (<i>r</i> = 0.171, <i>p</i> = 0.011) and ill-being and media addiction (<i>r</i> = 0.434, <i>p</i> = 0.024), not all types of digital media use had adverse consequences on adolescents' mental health. In particular, one-to-one communication, self-disclosure in the context of mutual online friendship, as well as positive and funny online experiences mitigated feelings of loneliness and stress. Hence, these positive aspects of online activities should be promoted. At the same time, awareness of the detrimental effects of addictive digital media use should be raised: That would include making adolescents more aware of adverse mechanisms such as social comparison, fear of missing out, and exposure to negative contents, which were more likely to happen during social isolation and confinement due to the pandemic.","Marciano, Ostroumova, Schulz, Camerini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.793868","20220221","Covid-19 pandemic; adolescence; media addiction; mental health; review; social media; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27315,""
"Explaining Experiences, Challenges and Adaptation Strategies in COVID-19 Patients: A Qualitative Study in Iran","Getting COVID-19 makes a person confront numerous individual, physical, psychological, family and social challenges. Therefore, the present study was conducted to explain the experiences, challenges and adaptation strategies in patients with COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran. The present study was performed with a qualitative approach and phenomenological method among 33 patients with COVID-19. From July 20 to September 21, access to participants and data collection were done in person (15 people) and by phone (18 people) through targeted sampling and snowball and semi-structured interviews. Data management was carried out using MAXQDA-2018 software and its analysis was done by the Colaizzi analysis method. Guba and Lincoln's criteria were also observed to improve the quality of results. After analyzing the data, two main categories and 17 subcategories were obtained, including (1) experiences and challenges (ignoring the disease, blaming, physical health disorders, mental problems, guilt, and remorse, being blamed, living a life of disappointment and ambiguity, emotional challenges, frustrating reactions from others, helplessness and limitation) and (2) disease adaptation strategies (spirituality, learning about COVID-19, doing valuable and fun activities, participating in treatment, strengthening one's spirit and hope, trying to make up for past mistakes and virtual communication). Based on the results, interventions and policies such as increasing people's health knowledge and literacy to get acquainted with the symptoms of the disease and prompt referral for diagnosis and treatment, teaching stress and psychological pressure management techniques, instructing families to continue emotional and social support for patients and strengthening and reproducing the strategies patients use, along with teaching disease coping skills, harnessing the potential of cyberspace and the media can make it easier to tolerate illness and get back to life.","Ahmadi, Irandoost, Ahmadi, Yoosefi Lebni, Mohammadi Gharehghani, Baba Safari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.778026","20220221","COVID-19; Iran; adaptation strategies; experiences; patients; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27316,""
"Transition and Sustainability of an Online Care Model for People With Parkinson's Disease in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic","CoronaVirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) led to social distancing and the need for alternative care models. Telehealth programs for people with Parkinson's (PWP) disease may ensure continuity of care. The goal of this observational survey study was to determine the practicability, satisfaction, and barriers to online programs, their relationship to perceived symptoms, mood, and quality of life, and program sustainability beyond the immediate pandemic. In-person Parkinson's programs at New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine transitioned online at the start of the pandemic to include Rock Steady Boxing, Support Groups, and Rock Steady Buddies. A custom online survey sent to 150 participants investigated PD history, symptomatology, level of exercise before and during the pandemic, depression (PHQ-9), quality of life (PDQ-39), and practicability and perceived satisfaction related to these online programs. Descriptive statistics were reported. Of 69 respondents [mean age of 70.2y (SD 8.4 yrs)], &gt;75% were satisfied with the transition to online programs. Consistent attendance and minimal barriers to programs indicated practicability, with increased adherence to exercise. Of 66 completed PHQ-9s, 22.7% had scores Ã¢â€°Â¥9 (moderate to severe depression); of 61 completed PDQ-39s, scores averaged 21.4; better quality of life than national averages for PWP. Self-perceived physical and mental wellbeing were positively affected. Results suggest the transition to online programs met the needs of the Parkinson's community in a practicable and sustainable manner during the pandemic. With COVID-19 still prevalent, the current model of blending synchronous online and in-person classes provides a more flexible, sustainable format compared to in-person alone. Institutions may consider including online components to existing programs to promote continuity of care for aging populations as part of best practices.","Ketigian, Piniella, McGivney, Lui, Dukat, Jung, Gallagher, Leder","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.772805","20220221","COVID-19; Parkinson's disease; Rock Steady Boxing; telehealth; telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27317,""
"Association Between Mental Health Outcomes and Changes in Lifestyle Behavior Index Among Saudi Adults 16 Weeks After COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Release","The current (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) pandemic is still uncontrolled with associated dramatic changes in daily lifestyle activities. Evidence for studying the impact of these health behavior changes on our mental health is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of psychological distresses and assess their influence by the change in the composite lifestyle behaviors before the COVID-19 pandemic till 16 weeks after the lockdown release in Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 10 and 31, 2020 by posting an online survey on social media platforms (WhatsApp and Twitter) to collect data on participants' sociodemographic, lifestyle behaviors, and mental health aspects using a validated Arabic version of the short-form version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). A total of 363 responded to the questionnaire. The mean age was 36.26 Ã‚Â± 8.54 years, and 238 (65.6%) were men. Depression, stress, and anxiety were reported in 37.5, 26.7, and 16.5% of the participants, respectively. Negative lifestyle behavioral changes were significantly associated with stress and anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression revealed that financial distress and history of psychiatric illnesses were common significant factors for developing the psychological distresses. Throughout the post-lockdown stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, there was an evidence of psychological distresses among the adults. Negative health-related changes are directly linked with increased psychological distress. Effective health promotion strategies directed toward adopting and maintaining positive change in the composite health behaviors are crucial.","Abd El-Fatah, Alshehri, Alsulami, Alasmari, Osman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.728117","20220221","COVID; Saudi Arabia; anxiety; composite lifestyle score; depression; post-lockdown; social determinants; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27318,""
"Perceptions and Expectations of School-Based Professionals Surrounding School-Based Mindfulness Training in Appalachia During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","School-based professionals often report high burnout, particularly in geographic areas like Appalachia, where school-aged children are exposed to high levels of adverse childhood experiences, which may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While school-based mindfulness trainings can reduce burnout, their efficacy is influenced by the expectations of intervention personnel ahead of implementation. The present study assessed expectations and perceptions of a school-based mindfulness training among school personnel in 21 Appalachian schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon enrollment in the training, staff (<i>N</i> = 191) responded to open ended survey questions regarding perceived impacts of COVID-19 on students, expected benefits and barriers to school-based mindfulness, and perceived community acceptance of mindfulness. School personnel identified social isolation and lack of structure as negative impacts of COVID-19 on students. Expected benefits of classroom mindfulness included improved coping skills, focus, and emotion regulation, whereas barriers included lack of time and student ability level (e.g., age, attention). While most respondents indicated that their community was accepting of mindfulness practices, some noted resistance to and misperceptions of mindfulness, which may illustrate the influence of local cultural norms and values on the acceptability of mental health interventions. Overall, these findings suggest positive expectations and relative perceived support for mindfulness practices within these Appalachian communities, including in response to negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on students. Adapting practices and language to accommodate barriers such as time, student ability, and cultural misconceptions of mindfulness may increase the feasibility and efficacy of these interventions.","Haliwa, Layman, Coffman, Snodgrass, Santer, Barlett, Long, Mason, Pfost, Harden, Dino, Jarrett","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.816494","20220221","Appalachia; COVID-19; burnout; compassion fatigue; mindfulness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27319,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic impacts psychiatric outcomes and alcohol use among college students","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed fundamental challenges on nearly every area of life. The purpose of the current study was to expand on the literature on the impact of the pandemic on college students by a) examining domains of impact of the pandemic on psychiatric and alcohol outcomes and b) controlling for pre-pandemic outcomes. Participants included 897 college students (78.6% female) from a larger longitudinal study on college student mental health. Structural equation models were fit to examine how COVID-19 impact (exposure, worry, food/housing insecurity, change in social media use, change in substance use) were associated with PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and alcohol phenotypes. Models were fit to adjust for pre-pandemic symptoms. No effects of <i>COVID-19 exposure</i> remained after adjusting for earlier outcomes. <i>COVID-19 worry</i> predicted PTSD, depression, and anxiety, even after adjusting for earlier levels of outcomes (ÃŽÂ²'s: .091-.180, <i>p</i>'sÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). <i>Housing/food concerns</i> predicted PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms as well as suicidal ideation (ÃŽÂ²'s: .085-.551, <i>p</i>'sÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05) after adjusting for earlier levels of symptoms. <i>Change in media use</i> predicted alcohol consumption (ÃŽÂ²'s: Ã‚Â± .116-.197, <i>p</i>'sÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). <i>Change in substance use</i> affected all outcomes except suicidality (ÃŽÂ²'s: .112-.591, <i>p</i>'sÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Domains of COVID-19 impact had differential effects on mental health and substance outcomes in college students during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Future studies should examine the trajectory of these factors on college student mental health across waves of the pandemic. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La pandemia de COVID-19 ha impuesto desafÃƒÂ­os fundamentales en prÃƒÂ¡cticamente todas las ÃƒÂ¡reas de la vida.<b>Objetivo:</b> El propÃƒÂ³sito del presente estudio fue ampliar la literatura sobre el impacto de la pandemia en estudiantes universitarios, a) examinando dominios de impacto de la pandemia sobre resultados psiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos y de alcohol, y b) controlando por resultados pre-pandemia.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> Los participantes incluyeron 897 estudiantes universitarios (78,6% mujeres) de un estudio longitudinal mÃƒÂ¡s grande sobre salud mental de estudiantes universitarios.

"Meta-analytic evidence of depression and anxiety in Eastern Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic","To perform a systematic and meta-analysis on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms including anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population in Eastern Europe, as well as three select sub-populations: students, general healthcare workers, and frontline healthcare workers. Studies in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv up to 6 February 2021. Prevalence rates of mental health symptoms in the general population and key sub-populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe. Data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression. The meta-analysis identifies and includes 21 studies and 26 independent samples in Eastern Europe. Poland (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4), Serbia (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4), Russia (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3), and Croatia (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3) had the greatest number of studies. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in eleven Eastern European countries including Hungary, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 18 studies with 22 samples was 30% (95% CI: 24-37%) pooled prevalence of depression in 18 studies with 23 samples was 27% (95% CI: 21-34%). The cumulative evidence from the meta-analysis reveals high prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe. The findings suggest evidence of a potential mental health crisis in Eastern Europe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our synthesis also reveals a relative lack of studies in certain Eastern European countries as well as high heterogeneities among the existing studies, calling for more effort to achieve evidence-based mental healthcare in Eastern Europe. <b>Objetivo:</b> Realizar un metanÃƒÂ¡lisis sistemÃƒÂ¡tico sobre las tasas de prevalencia de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental, incluidos ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en la poblaciÃƒÂ³n general de Europa del Este, asÃƒÂ­ como en tres subpoblaciones seleccionadas: estudiantes, trabajadores sanitarios generales y trabajadores sanitarios de primera lÃƒÂ­nea.<b>Fuentes de datos:</b> Estudios en PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO y medRxiv hasta el 6 de febrero de 2021.<b>Criterios de elegibilidad y anÃƒÂ¡lisis de datos:</b> Tasas de prevalencia de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental en la poblaciÃƒÂ³n general y subpoblaciones claves durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en Europa del Este. Los datos se combinaron mediante un metanÃƒÂ¡lisis de efectos aleatorios para estimar las tasas de prevalencia de ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n.<b>Resultados:</b> El metanÃƒÂ¡lisis identifica e incluye 21 estudios y 26 muestras independientes en Europa del Este.

Hasta donde sabemos, no se han realizado estudios en once paÃƒÂ­ses de Europa del Este, incluidos HungrÃƒÂ­a, Eslovaquia y Eslovenia. La prevalencia combinada de ansiedad en 18 estudios con 22 muestras fue de 30% (IC del 95%: 24Ã¢â‚¬â€œ37%) y la prevalencia combinada de depresiÃƒÂ³n en 18 estudios con 23 muestras fue de 27% (IC del 95%: 21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ34%).<b>Implicaciones:</b> La evidencia acumulada del metanÃƒÂ¡lisis revela altas tasas de prevalencia de sÃƒÂ­ntomas clÃƒÂ­nicamente significativos durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en Europa del Este. Los hallazgos sugieren evidencia de una posible crisis de salud mental en Europa del Este durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en curso. Nuestra sÃƒÂ­ntesis tambiÃƒÂ©n revela una relativa falta de estudios en ciertos paÃƒÂ­ses de Europa del Este, asÃƒÂ­ como una gran heterogeneidad entre los estudios existentes, lo que exige un mayor esfuerzo para lograr una atenciÃƒÂ³n de la salud mental basada en la evidencia en Europa del Este. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã¦â„¢Â®Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¤Â¸â€°Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ©â‚¬â€°Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¤ÂºÅ¡Ã§Â»â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤ (Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§â€Å¸, Ã¦â„¢Â®Ã©â‚¬Å¡Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€°ÂÃ§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜Ëœ) Ã¥Å“Â¨ COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂºÂ</b>: Ã¦Ë†ÂªÃ¨â€¡Â³ 2021 Ã¥Â¹Â´ 2 Ã¦Å“Ë† 6 Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã§Å¡â€ž PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO Ã¥â€™Å’ medRxiv Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¨Âµâ€žÃ¦Â Â¼Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾Â</b>: Ã¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§ COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¨Ë†Â¬Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã©â€Â®Ã¤ÂºÅ¡Ã§Â»â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â¾Â¤Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§â€Â¨Ã©Å¡ÂÃ¦Å“ÂºÃ¦â€¢Ë†Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦Â±â€¡Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¼Â°Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã§ÂºÂ³Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã§Å¡â€ž 21 Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥â€™Å’ 26 Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ§â€¹Â¬Ã§Â«â€¹Ã¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â³Â¢Ã¥â€¦Â° (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4), Ã¥Â¡Å¾Ã¥Â°â€Ã§Â»Â´Ã¤ÂºÅ¡ (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4), Ã¤Â¿â€žÃ§Â½â€”Ã¦â€“Â¯ (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥â€¦â€¹Ã§Â½â€”Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¤ÂºÅ¡ (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦ÂÂ®Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã§Å¸Â¥, Ã¥Â°Å¡Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¥Å’Ë†Ã§â€°â„¢Ã¥Ë†Â©, Ã¦â€“Â¯Ã¦Â´â€ºÃ¤Â¼ÂÃ¥â€¦â€¹Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€“Â¯Ã¦Â´â€ºÃ¦â€“â€¡Ã¥Â°Â¼Ã¤ÂºÅ¡Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã§Å¡â€ž 11 Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨ 22 Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Å¡â€ž 18 Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­, Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â±â€¡Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº 30% (95% CI:24%Ã¢â‚¬â€œ37%), Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Å“Â¨ 18 Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶ (Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬ 23 Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬) Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â±â€¡Ã¦â‚¬Â»Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº 27% (95% CI:21%Ã¢â‚¬â€œ34%)Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¥Ââ€˜</b>: Ã¥â€¦Æ’Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â´Â¯Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ¦ÂÂ®Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã§Â¤Âº, COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã©Â«ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Å’ÂÃ§Â»Â­Ã§Å¡â€ž COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´, Ã¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥ÂÂ±Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»Â¼Ã¥ÂË†Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¨Â¿ËœÃ¦ÂÂ­Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Å¸ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ºÃ¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Â¼ÂºÃ¤Â¹Â, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§Å½Â°Ã¦Å“â€°Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©Â«ËœÃ¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¨Â´Â¨Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã¥â€˜Â¼Ã¥ÂÂÃ¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸Å“Ã¦Â¬Â§Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã§Å½Â°Ã¥Â¾ÂªÃ¨Â¯ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂÅ¡Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¥Å ÂªÃ¥Å â€ºÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Zhang, Miller, Xu, Yin, Chen, Delios, Dong, Chen, McIntyre, Wan, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.2000132","20220221","COVID-19; epidemic; frontline healthcare workers; general population; healthcare workers; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27321,""
"Immune Response Is Key to Genetic Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Psychiatric Disorders Based on Differential Gene Expression Pattern Analysis","Existing evidence demonstrates that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to psychiatric illness, despite its main clinical manifestations affecting the respiratory system. People with mental disorders are more susceptible to COVID-19 than individuals without coexisting mental health disorders, with significantly higher rates of severe illness and mortality in this population. The incidence of new psychiatric diagnoses after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is also remarkably high. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to use angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor for infecting susceptible cells and is expressed in various tissues, including brain tissue. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate the mechanism linking psychiatric disorders to COVID-19. Using a data set of peripheral blood cells from patients with COVID-19, we compared this to data sets of whole blood collected from patients with psychiatric disorders and used bioinformatics and systems biology approaches to identify genetic links. We found a large number of overlapping immune-related genes between patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and differentially expressed genes of bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SZ), and late-onset major depressive disorder (LOD). Many pathways closely related to inflammatory responses, such as MAPK, PPAR, and TGF-ÃŽÂ² signaling pathways, were observed by enrichment analysis of common differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also performed a comprehensive analysis of protein-protein interaction network and gene regulation networks. Chemical-protein interaction networks and drug prediction were used to screen potential pharmacologic therapies. We hope that by elucidating the relationship between the pathogenetic processes and genetic mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 with psychiatric disorders, it will lead to innovative strategies for future research and treatment of psychiatric disorders linked toÃ‚Â COVID-19.","Xia, Chen, Li, Li, Gan, Wu, Prohaska, Bai, Gao, Gu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.798538","20220221","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; differentially expressed gene; functional enrichment; psychiatric illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27322,""
"Digital Dance for People With Parkinson's Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Feasibility Study","Dance as a treatment to support physical, cognitive and emotional functioning, has gained increased acceptance as a healthcare intervention for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been far reaching with devastating effects for at-risk populations. To find alternative and safe treatment delivery options during the pandemic has been of utmost importance. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate the feasibility and the experience of digital dance for people with PD (Dance for PDÃ‚Â©) and to examine change in self-reported quality of life, psychological health, subjective cognitive complaints and mental fatigue. 23 participants with PD (mean age 70) partook in 10-h weekly digital Dance for PD sessions. Feasibility outcome measures were assessed at post-test. Web-based questionnaires examining quality of life, subjective memory complaints, depression, anxiety and mental fatigue were administered at pre- and post-test. Moreover, nine participants partook in focus group discussions at post-test. The results showed an acceptable feasibility to home-based digital Dance for PD, where 86% of the dance classes were completed, only minor negative side effects were reported (i.e., sore joints), and all experienced the dance classes as motivating and safe to do at home. The majority also reported positive effects on mood and physical functioning. The results from the questionnaires showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and quality of life (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at post-test. In the focus groups, participants indicated that digital dance was a beneficial and enjoyable activity with a strong added value during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, they experienced that digital dance missed some important elements of live dance. This study showed that digital Dance for PD is feasible and holds promise as a viable and safe method to keep people with PD dancing even when physical meetings are not possible. Beyond the pandemic, digital dance could be applied to a wide variety of patient groups including rural populations and patients for whom transportation may not be feasible for practical or financial reasons.

"Home Physical Exercise Protocol for Older Adults, Applied Remotely During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for Randomized and Controlled Trial","The emergence of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020, considered a public health emergency due to its high transmission rate and lack of specific treatment, led many countries to adhere to social isolation. Although necessary, social isolation causes important psychological changes, negatively affecting the health of the population, including the older population. The aim of this study is to propose a 4-week, home-based physical exercise protocol for older people in social isolation and evaluate whether will promote positive changes in psychological variables such as anxiety, mood, depression, and stress, and in the variables sleep, quality of life, and physical capacities in the older adults. The sample will be selected in a probabilistic way from individuals aged 60 years or more from the city of ItajaÃƒÂ­ (Santa Catarina, Brazil). Of these, half will perform a home-based resistance training protocol, with 3 weekly sessions, for 4 consecutive weeks. For group allocation, patients will be randomized with a computer-generated 1:1 allocation to the physical exercise (PE) group or control group. Outcomes will be depressive symptoms, sleep quality, quality of life, stress, mood states, anxiety, and functional capacity, evaluated at baseline, after 4 weeks, and after 15 days of follow-up. This study will offer a home-based exercise protocol for older adults, with load progression and remote monitoring, thus filling a gap in the provision of PE in this population. The results will be able to identify possible improvements not only in physical health, but also in quality of life and mental health. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> The trial registration was carried out in the Brazil Clinical Trials Registry (RBR-5qh6f3v).

"Lockdown Measures Against the Spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Negative Effects for People Living With Depression","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated measures to restrict the spread of the virus correlated with limitations in healthcare and changes in depression-related lifestyle elements (loss of daily structure, lack of exercise, and extended bed and sleep time) for depressed patients, both of which are known to negatively affect the course of depression. This paper examines, (i) the reporting of a worsening state of illness as a result of COVID-19-related measures among individuals with depressive disorders; and (ii) whether this worsening was related to restrictions in healthcare for depression or changes in depression-related lifestyle. The analysis was based on a population-representative survey of the German population aged 18-69 years (<i>N</i> = 5,135 respondents, comprising a subgroup of <i>n</i> = 1,038 persons suffering from depression and <i>n</i> = 598 persons who spent the lockdown primarily in home isolation). The key findings were: 49% (<i>n</i> = 505) of respondents with self-reported diagnosed depression reported that the measures against the pandemic had a negative impact on their depressive illness (new depressive episode, worsening of symptoms, suicidal impulses, suicide attempt, and other negative consequences). Of those who reported impaired access to healthcare for their depressive illness, 70% (<i>n</i> = 276) also reported a worsening of their depressive illness. This was a significantly higher percentage than those who did not experience impaired access to healthcare (36%, <i>n</i> = 229, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Of those who reported changes in depression-related lifestyle (loss of daily structure, lack of exercise, or extended bed and sleep time), 58% (<i>n</i> = 308) reported a worsening of their depressive illness. This was a significantly higher percentage than those who did not exhibit any of the outlined behaviours (28%, <i>n</i> = 19, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Worsening of the depressive illness was most common among those who reported a lack of daily structure or extended bedtimes (67%; <i>n</i> = 230 resp. <i>N</i> = 226). People who mentioned a lack of exercise also reported a worsening of their depressive illness (59%; <i>n</i> = 271). These findings reinforce the need to consider the suffering and possible increased suicide risk to people suffering from depression induced by measures designed to constrain the COVID-19 pandemic; an important consideration in identifying the optimal risk-benefit ratio when setting pandemic measures. Our study highlighted the importance of maintaining healthcare, even in crisis situations, and ensuring access to guideline-based treatment for people who need urgent care. It also showed that political interventions can influence individual behaviours that can have negative effects on depressive illness.","Czaplicki, Reich, Hegerl","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.789173","20220221","COVID-19; depression; depression-related lifestyle; extended bed and sleep times; healthcare; lack of exercise; loss of daily structure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27325,""
"Does Mental Health Affect the Decision to Vaccinate Against SARS-CoV-2? A Cross-Sectional Nationwide Study Before the Vaccine Campaign","The COVID-19 pandemic generated a sense of threat in the society, leading to social isolation and mental health deterioration. A great deal of hope for the development of herd immunity was placed in preventive vaccinations. The survey, performed before vaccine campaign between September 26-October 27, 2020, during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Poland with the Computer Assisted Web Interviews method. The study was partly community based and partly open to the public. Participants were invited to complete the survey using Google forms <i>via</i> social media (Facebook, WhatsApp). The survey was also distributed 54 times at the request of interested persons <i>via</i> e-mail. Total 1,043 questionnaires were assessed for eligibility and 41 were excluded (13 because of the age under 18, and 28 due to refusal to participate: non-response after sending questionnaire <i>via</i> e-mail). Finally 1,001 questionnaires were included to the study and statistical analysis was performed on the basis of the 1,001 responses. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: a sociodemographic survey, a questionnaire assessing the knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 and the General Health Questionnaire-28. Participants also determined their attitude toward being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The questionnaire was completed by a total of 1,001 participants: 243 people declared that they will not get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Majority of people declaring the willingness to vaccinate were representatives of medical professions, suffering from chronic diseases, with higher values on the total GHQ-28 scale and the subscales: anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and somatic dysfunction. Loss of income, difficult access to health care, recognizing the restrictions as excessive and knowledge about COVID-19 were found as significant positive determinants of the reluctance to vaccinate. Greater readiness to vaccinate can be associated with greater certainty about its effectiveness and a hypothetical collectivist attitude. Experiencing anxiety and psychopathological symptoms are risk factors for infection, but can also be conducive to reliance on information about vaccination presented in the media. Reluctance to vaccinate may result from greater awareness of the complexity of the disease, and thus less faith in the effectiveness of vaccines.","Maciaszek, Lenart-Bugla, SzczeÃ…â€ºniak, GawÃ…â€šowski, Borowicz, Misiak, Rymaszewska","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.810529","20220221","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; mental deterioration; vaccine decision-making","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27326,""
"The Prevalence of Psychological Distress and Its Relationship to Sleep Quality in Saudi Arabia's General Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic","We aimed to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures on sleep quality and psychological distress in Saudi Arabia. Subjective sleep quality over the preceding 30 days was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). In addition, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to assess the psychological distress. The study included 836 participants. The median age was 28 years, 624 (74.64%) were females, and 158 (18.90%) were healthcare workers. Factors associated with poor sleep were recent changes in the sleep habits <i>p</i> = 0.004), anxiety or fear because of coronavirus news on social media <i>p</i> = 0.02), fear because there was no approved drug to treat COVID-19 <i>p</i> = 0.03), and unaware of the presence of chronic diseases <i>p</i> = 0.03). Female gender <i>p</i> = 0.02), fear or anxiety because of coronavirus news on social media <i>p</i> = 0.04), recent change in sleep habits (OR: 1.97 (1.15-3.39); <i>p</i> = 0.01), fear because there is no approved drug to treat COVID-19 <i>p</i> = 0.001), monthly income &lt;1000 SR <i>p</i> = 0.01), and isolation <i>p</i> = 0.01) were associated with distress. PSQI and K10 scores were significantly correlated <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Poor sleep and psychological distress are common during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Identifying factors associated with poor sleep and psychological distress would help develop specific intervention programs that enhance mental health and sleep quality during pandemics.","AlRasheed, Al-Aqeel, Alkadir, Bin Shuqiran, Khurshid, AlRasheed, Al-Kufeidy, Alhaj, Jahrami, BaHammam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.809040","20220221","COVID-19; K10 score; PSQI score; psychological distress; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27327,""

"Suicide in Healthcare Workers: Determinants, Challenges, and the Impact of COVID-19","The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which first appeared in Wuhan, China, and was later declared a pandemic, has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Numerous efforts have been made worldwide to understand the disease's physical manifestation. However, less emphasis has been placed on the pandemic's mental health challenges for healthcare workers (HCWs) who played a critical role in fighting the disease. Existing literature shows the detrimental psychological impact and increased incidence of depression and anxiety among HCWs. It is expected that the mental health crisis will become a serious issue affecting HCWs, with long-term negative consequences following COVID. Physicians and nurses already represent the highest risk groups of suicide among the general population, and suicide can be regarded as an occupational hazard in the healthcare industry. Increased workload, burnout and fatigue, multifaceted challenges women HCWs, and increased substance abuse are contributing factors to suicide ideation. In this article, we identify the risk factors of suicide among HCWs, discuss mental health challenges exacerbated by the pandemic and its impact on suicide ideation.","Awan, Diwan, Aamir, Allahuddin, Irfan, Carano, Vellante, Ventriglio, Fornaro, Valchera, Pettorruso, Martinotti, Di Giannantonio, Ullah, De Berardis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.792925","20220221","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; healthcare workers; post-traumatic stress; substance abuse; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27329,""
"Impacts of Stress and Risk Perception on Mental Health of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Coping Efficacy","In this study, we aimed to explore the influences of pandemic stress, risk perception, and coping efficacy on the mental health of Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationally representative sample of Chinese college students (<i>N</i> = 3,381, <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 20.85, <i>SD</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 1.31) took part in an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Correlation coefficients, structural equation modeling, and other statistical analysis methods were used for data analysis. (1) The Chinese college students' pandemic stress and perceived pandemic risk were found to be moderate (3.51 Ã‚Â± 0.83, 3.45 Ã‚Â± 0.94), whereas their perceived infection risk was lower (2.10 Ã‚Â± 0.67). Their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic was found to be good (3.80 Ã‚Â± 0.73). (2) The quality of their mental health was significantly and negatively associated with pandemic stress, perceived pandemic risk, and perceived infection risk. The level of their mental health was significantly and positively associated with coping efficacy, and their coping efficacy was significantly and negatively associated with pandemic stress, perceived pandemic risk, and perceived infection risk. Coping efficacy played a partial mediating role in the relationship between pandemic stress and mental health, coping efficacy played a partial mediating role in the relationship between perceived infection risk and mental health, and coping efficacy played a complete mediating role in the relationship between perceived pandemic risk and mental health. Our findings show the importance of fostering college students' coping efficacy to improve their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xu, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.767189","20220221","college students; coping efficacy; epidemic stress; mental health; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27330,""
"How have governments supported citizens stranded abroad due to COVID-19 travel restrictions? A comparative analysis of the financial and health support in eleven countries","In response to the continuing threat of importing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many countries have implemented some form of border restriction. A repercussion of these restrictions has been that some travellers have found themselves stranded abroad unable to return to their country of residence, and in need for government support. Our analysis explores the COVID-19-related information and support options provided by 11 countries to their citizens stranded overseas due to travel restrictions. We also examined the quality (i.e., readability, accessibility, and useability) of the information that was available from selected governments' web-based resources. Between June 18 to June 30, 2021, COVID-19-related webpages from 11 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Canada, United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK), France, Spain, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand) were reviewed and content relating to information and support for citizens stuck overseas analysed. Government assistance-related data from each webpage was extracted and coded for the following themes: travel arrangements, health and wellbeing, finance and accommodation, information needs, and sources. Readability was examined using the Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) and the Flesch Kincaid readability tests; content 'accessibility' was measured using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1; and content 'usability' assessed using the usability heuristics for website design tool. Ninety-eight webpages from 34 websites were evaluated. No country assessed covered all themes analysed. Most provided information and some level of support regarding repatriation options; border control and re-entry measures; medical assistance; and traveller registration. Only three countries provided information or support for emergency housing while abroad, and six provided some form of mental health support for their citizens. Our analysis of the quality of COVID-19-related information available on a subset of four countries' websites found poor readability and multiple accessibility and usability issues. This study uniquely analyses government support for citizens stuck abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic. With large variance in the information and services available across the countries analysed, our results highlight gaps, inconsistencies, and potential inequities in support available, and raise issues pertinent to the quality, accessibility, and usability of information. This study will assist policymakers plan and communicate comprehensive support packages for citizens stuck abroad due to the COVID-19 situation and design future efforts to prepare for global public health emergencies.","McDermid, Craig, Sheel, Seale","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07155-2","20220221","COVID-19; Communication; Pandemic; Travel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27331,""
"The pooled prevalence of the mental problems of Chinese medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak: A meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on the mental health of the medical staff in China, especially those on the first-line (frontline) of the pandemic. But the profile of the mental problem of nationwide Chinese medical staff is still unclear, especially about the sleep problems. There are five databases (PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database and Web of Science) searched to identify the published studies on the mental health of the medical staff in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. The pooled prevalence of mental problems of Chinese medical staff during the pandemic were calculated, especially for the first-line medical staff. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed to identify the potential impact factors. A total of 71 articles including 98,533 participants are included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the pooled prevalence of the mental problems was as follows: anxiety problem 27%, depression problem 29%, sleep problem 40%. Subgroup analysis showed that there were significant differences in the prevalence of anxiety and depression problems between first-line and non-first-line medical staff (p &lt; 0.01). Sex had a significant impact on the sleep of first-line medical staff (p &lt; 0.01). There may be heterogeneity among the included studies. The analysis of potential influencing factors remains limited. The prevalence of adverse mental problems among medical staff is high during the COVID-19 outbreak. We need to pay special attention to the mental health of first-line medical staff, especially the sleep problems of female first-line workers.","Hu, Deng, Yang, Wang, Cui, Chen, Wang, He, Chai, Liu, Zhang, Xiao, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.045","20220220","COVID-19; medical staff; mental problem; meta-analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27332,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the well-being, education and clinical practice of general practice trainees and trainers: a national cross-sectional study","COVID-19 has changed General Practice (GP) education as well as GP clinical activities. These changes have had an impact on the well-being of medical trainees and the role of GP plays in the society. We have therefore aimed to investigate the impact that COVID-19 has had on GP trainees and trainers in four domains: education, workload, practice organization and the role of GP in society. a cross-sectional study design was used. The Interuniversity Centre for the Education of General Practitioners sent an online survey with close-ended and open-ended questions to all GP trainees and trainers in Flanders, active in the period March - September 2020. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the quantitative data and thematic analysis for the qualitative data. 216 (response 25%) GP trainees and 311 (response 26%) trainers participated. GP trainees (63%, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°136) and trainers (76%, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°236) reported new learning opportunities since the COVID-19 pandemic. The introduction of telehealth consulting and changing guidelines required new communication and organizational skills. Most of the GP trainees (75%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°162) and trainers (71%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°221) experienced more stress at work and an overload of administrative work. The unfamiliarity with a new infectious disease and the fact that COVID-19 care compromised general GP clinical activities, created insecurity among GP trainers and trainees. Moreover, GP trainees felt that general GP activities were insufficiently covered during the COVID-19 pandemic for their training in GP. GP trainers and trainees experienced mutual support, and secondary support came from other direct colleagues. Measures such as reducing the writing of medical certificates and financial support for administrative and (para) medical support can help to reprioritize the core of GP care. COVID-19 has enhanced the use of digital learning over peer-to-peer learning and lectures. However, GP trainees and trainers preferred blended learning educational activities. COVID-19 has created learning opportunities such as telehealth consulting and a flexible organization structure. To ensure quality GP education during the pandemic and beyond, regular GP care should remain the core activity of GP trainees and trainers and a balance between all different learning methods should be found.","Coenen, Poel, Schoenmakers, Van Renterghem, Gielis, Remmen, Michels","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03174-4","20220220","COVID-19; General Practice; Health care organization; Medical education; Mental health; Telehealth; Workplace learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27333,""
"Stimuli changes and challenging behavior in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 restrictions in nursing homes resulted in a reduction in stimuli for residents. This study aimed to explore observed effects of changes in stimuli, both targeted (e.g., planned recreational activities) and untargeted (e.g., spontaneous noise), on challenging behavior in nursing home residents during COVID-19 anti-pandemic measures. In an online survey, nursing home healthcare professionals in the Netherlands provided their perspectives on the effects of the reduction in untargeted stimuli on residents with mild, advanced, or no dementia, and on different types of challenging behavior (i.e., psychotic, depressed, anxious, agitated, or apathetic behavior). Additionally, we asked participants' opinions about strategies for limiting untargeted stimuli and for adjusting targeted stimuli for optimal management of challenging behaviors. In total, 199 professionals completed the survey. Residents with advanced dementia and those with psychotic and agitated behavior seemed to benefit from the reductions in stimuli not specifically targeted at the resident. In contrast, residents without dementia and those with depressive and apathetic behavior seemed to be negatively affected by reductions in untargeted stimuli. Participants would like to continue reducing untargeted stimuli in the future (e.g., limiting the use of corridors adjacent to residents' rooms) and to adapt existing or introduce new initiatives involving targeted stimuli (e.g., small-scale, individually tailored activities). Responses to open-ended questions revealed additional initiatives that could be useful in nursing home care. This study provided lessons to learn from the COVID-19 measures in nursing homes. While many residents may have been negatively affected by the restrictions imposed during the pandemic, specific resident groups may have benefitted from the reduction in untargeted stimuli and from the adjustments made to daily activities. Various strategies and initiatives used in nursing homes during the pandemic seem promising for meeting individual needs in managing challenging behavior. These findings suggest that certain stimuli may affect specific resident groups differently. This underlines the importance of finding the right balance between stimuli and tranquility, tailored to the needs of individual residents. It is important to consider the stimuli present in nursing homes, whether targeted or untargeted, when analyzing and treating challenging behavior.","Knippenberg, Leontjevas, Nijsten, Bakker, Koopmans, Gerritsen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-02824-y","20220220","Activities; COVID-19; Challenging behavior; Nursing home; Stimuli","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27334,""
"Neuroinflammation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Link Social Stress to Depression","Major depressive disorder is a debilitating mental illness and a leading cause of global disease burden. While many etiological factors have been identified, social stress is a highly prevalent causative factor for the onset of depression. Unfortunately, rates of depression continue to increase around the world, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this mental health crisis. Though several therapeutic strategies are available, nearly 50% of patients who receive treatment never reach remission. The exact mechanisms by which social stress exposure promotes the development of depression are unclear, making it challenging to develop novel and more effective therapeutics. However, accumulating evidence points to a role for stress-induced neuroinflammation, particularly in treatment-resistant patients. Moreover, recent evidence has expanded the concept of the pathogenesis of depression to mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the combined effects of social stress on mitochondria and inflammation may synergize to facilitate stress-related depression. In this chapter, we review evidence for neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of social stress-induced depression and discuss these in the context of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of depression.","Hollis, Pope, Gorman-Sandler, Wood","https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2021_300","20220220","Blood brain barrier; Chronic stress; Cytokine; Microglia; ROS","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27335,""
"Perceived job insecurity and risk of suicide and suicide attempts: a study of men and women in the Swedish working population","Whether perceived job insecurity increases the risk of suicidal behaviors is unclear. Improved understanding in this area could inform efforts to reduce suicide risk among those experiencing elevated job insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as post-pandemic. We aimed to investigate if perceived job insecurity predicted increased risk of suicide mortality and suicide attempts. Employees (N=65 571), representative of the Swedish working population who participated in the Swedish Work Environment Survey in 1991-2003, were followed up through 2016 in the National Inpatient and Death Registers. Suicide deaths and suicide attempts were defined according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 and ICD-8/9 codes of underlying cause of death and in-/outpatient care. Job insecurity and subsequent risk of suicide and suicide attempt were investigated with marginal structural Cox regression analyses and inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for confounding. Perceived job insecurity was associated with an elevated risk of suicide [hazard ratio (HR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.20], but not with incident suicide attempts (HR 1.03, CI 0.86-1.24). Estimates remained similar after considering prevalent/previous poor mental health, other work factors, and when restricting the follow up time to ten years. The study suggests that job insecurity is associated with an increased risk of suicide mortality. Concerns about elevated job insecurity and suicide levels in the wake of the current pandemic could thus be considered in strategies to reduce the population health impact job insecurity both during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blomqvist, Virtanen, LaMontagne, Magnusson Hanson","https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.4015","20220220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27336,""
"Cognition, Behavior, and Caregiver Stress in Dementia during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Indian Perspective","Little is known regarding the cognitive and behavioral status of patients with dementia and their caregivers in lower middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to understand the impact of the pandemic on persons with dementia and their caregivers in India. This was an observational study. A cohort of 66 persons with dementia and their caregivers were evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2 specialist hospitals in South India. Caregivers were interviewed at 2 distinct time points of the pandemic: during the national lockdown and 5 months after during later periods of the ""cluster of cases"" transmission phase. Participants were assessed via telephone utilizing validated instruments (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI], Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] Scale, and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale [DASS-21]) and a semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire documented sociodemographic information, clinical history, infection measures adopted, changes in caregiving routines, involvement in functional rehabilitation activities, and access to medical and long-term care support services. The 2-phase follow-up study found a significant worsening of behavior in dementia patients, demonstrated by a difference in the NPI sub-domain scores for anxiety (mean difference [standard deviation, SD] = -0.552 [1.993], t58 = -2.109, p = 0.039) and eating disturbances (mean difference [SD] = -1.121 [2.493], t59 = -3.424, p = 0.001). A relatively high proportion of patients developed anxiety (cumulative incidence = 24.53%) and eating disturbances (cumulative incidence = 26.92%), without having these symptoms at baseline. There was a trend toward an increase in proportion of persons with severe dementia (19.7% vs. 39.4%) on follow-up. Caregiver distress reported was significantly associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (r = 0.712, p &lt; 0.001) and dementia severity (ÃÂ = 0.365, p = 0.004). In addition, difficulties in accessing medical care persisted between the 2 assessments, and there were statistically significant differences between functional rehabilitation activities such as indoor activities (p &lt; 0.001), outdoor activities (p = 0.013), and physical exercises (p = 0.003) between baseline and follow-up. Findings suggest interruption of functional rehabilitation activities and disruption in medical care services are likely to have had an adverse impact on patients with dementia and contributed toward caregiver distress.","Rajagopalan, Arshad, Thomas, Varghese, Hurzuk, Hoskeri, Ramappa, Nair, Paplikar, Mekala, Manae, Ramanna, Rakesh, Ganeshbhai, Dhiren, Komaravolu, Kammammettu, Rao, Alladi","https://doi.org/10.1159/000519616","20220220","COVID-19; Caregiving; Cognition; Dementia; India; Lower middle-income countries; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27337,""
"COVID-19 and psychosis, depression, obsession and quality of life in Lebanese patients with schizophrenia: Any changes after 5Ã‚Â months of quarantine?","Previous research revealed an absence of any previous studies reporting the impact that pandemics may have on psychotic symptomology, nor on the physical health of people with psychosis in response to the epidemics of the COVID-19. The direction of the impact of the COVID-19 on schizophrenia is unknown, as the risk of infection could vary from patients to patients according to clinical comorbidities, cognitive impairment, acute symptoms, and family support. To the best of our knowledge, no study has provided details on the variation of symptoms in patients with schizophrenia during the quarantine of COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, the primary objective of the study is to investigate the variation of psychotic symptoms, depression, obsession and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia before and after 5Ã‚Â months of quarantine and evaluate factors associated with these variations during the quarantine period. A cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of 190 chronic patients institutionalized for schizophrenia for more than 1Ã‚Â year at the Psychiatric Hospital of the Cross. The baseline assessment was done in December 2019; the second assessment was done in August 2020 (5Ã‚Â months after the lockdown). Getting updates about the coronavirus minimally, some and most of the times were significantly associated with a decrease in positive psychotic and psychopathologic symptoms 5Ã‚Â months after quarantine compared to before it. Practicing religiosity some and all the time versus not was significantly associated with a decrease in negative, psychopathology symptoms and total PANSS score after 5Ã‚Â months of quarantine compared to before it. Finally, female gender (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.77) was significantly associated with an increase in the WHO Domain 3 score (better social relations) after 5Ã‚Â months of quarantine compared to before it. Patients with schizophrenia fare better symptomatically after 5Ã‚Â months of quarantine if they receive constant updates about COVID-19 and if they tended to practice religiosity.","Haddad, Dib, Akl, Hallit, Obeid","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00750-7","20220220","Covid-19; Depression; Obsession; Quality of life; Quarantine; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","",27338,""
