"Typhoon Eye Effect vs Ripple Effect: The Role of Family Size on the Mental Health under the COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan","BackgroundThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 impacts the mental health of people worldwide. The mental conditions and the associated predictors of adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remains understudied. We aim to investigate distress, anxiety and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine the mental health issues based on the distance to the epicenter, a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The samples consist of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5 months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distance to the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi in Pakistan.

ResultsThe results showed that 9.2% and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off of distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance to the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance to the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan.

ConclusionThe evidence of the study interestingly finds the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance to the epicenter depends on the family. The evidence of this study can help to provide the initial indicator for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues to struggle to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tooba Lateef; Jiyao Chen; Muhammad Tahir; Teba Abdul Lateef; Bryan Chen; Jizhen Li; Stephen X.

"Maternal health among Venezuelan women migrants at the border of Brazil","BACKGROUND: Guaranteeing the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of populations living in fragile and humanitarian settings is essential and constitutes a basic human right  Compounded by the inherent vulnerabilities of women in crises, substantial complications are directly associated with increased risks of poor SRHR outcomes for displaced populations  The migration of Venezuelans, displaced due to current economic circumstances, is one of the largest in Latin America's history  This study aims to provide an overview of the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues affecting migrant Venezuelan women in the state of Roraima, Brazil  METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted from 24 to 30 November 2019  Data collection covered various issues involving access to and use of SRH services by 405 migrant Venezuelan women aged 18-49 years  The Minimum Initial Service Package readiness assessment tools, available from the Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises, were used in the data collection  RESULTS: Most commonly, the women reported unmet family planning needs  Of these, a significant proportion reported being unable to obtain contraceptive methods, particularly long-acting reversible contraceptives, either due to the woman's inability to access them or their unavailability at healthcare centres  Although a significant proportion of women were largely satisfied with the attention received at the maternity hospital, both before and during childbirth, 24 0% of pregnant or postpartum women failed to receive any prenatal or postnatal care  CONCLUSION: Meeting the essential SRHR needs of migrant Venezuelan women in Roraima, Brazil is a challenge that has yet to be fully addressed  Given the size of this migrant population, the Brazilian healthcare system has failed to adapt sufficiently to meet their needs;however, problems with healthcare provision are similar for migrants and Brazilian citizens  Efforts need to be encouraged not only in governmental health sectors, but also with academic, non-governmental and international organisations, including a coordinated approach to ensure a comprehensive SRHR response  Given the current high risks associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, meeting the SRHR needs of migrant populations has become more critical than ever","Bahamondes, L.; Laporte, M.; Margatho, D.; de Amorim, H.

"SEX DISPARITIES IN COVID-19 SEVERITY AND OUTCOME: ARE MEN WEAKER OR WOMEN STRONGER?","The COVID-19 outbreak is a global public health issue, having profound effects on most aspects of societal well-being, including physical and mental health. A plethora of studies, globally, have suggested the existence of a sex disparity in the outcome of COVID-19 patients, that is mainly due to mechanisms of viral infection, immune response to the virus, development of a hyperinflammation, and development of systemic complications, particularly thromboembolism. These differences appear to be more pronounced in elderly COVID-19 patients. Epidemiological data report a sex difference in the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease with a more favourable course of the disease in women compared to men, regardless of age range although the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be similar in both sexes. Sex hormones, including androgens and estrogens, may not only impact viral entry and load, but also shape the clinical manifestations, complications and, ultimately, the outcome of COVID-19 disease. The current review comprehensively summarizes current literature on sex disparities in susceptibility and outcomes of COVID-19 disease as well as the literature underpinning the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms, which may provide a rationale to a sex disparity. These include sex hormone influences on molecules that facilitate virus entry and priming, as well as the immune and inflammatory response, as well as coagulation and thrombosis diathesis. Based on present evidence, women appear to be relatively protected from COVID-19 because of a more effective immune response and a less pronounced systemic inflammation, with consequent moderate clinical manifestations of the disease, together with a lesser predisposition to thromboembolism. Conversely, men appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 disease because of a less effective immune response with consequent increased susceptibility to infections, together with a greater predisposition to thromboembolism. In elderlies, sex disparities in overall mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection is even more palpable, as elderly men appear more prone to severe COVID-19 because of a greater predisposition to infections, a weaker immune defence and an enhanced thrombotic state compared to women. The review highlights potential novel therapeutic approaches employing the administration of hormonal or anti-hormonal therapy in combination with antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients.","Pivonello, Auriemma, Pivonello, Isidori, Corona, Colao, Millar","https://doi.org/10.1159/000513346","20201126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7554,""
"Supporting recovery from COVID-19","COVID-19 is a new disease. Most research into the disease has focused on prevention of viral spread and treatment, but little is known about how patients recover. Nurses, whether in hospital, the community or in primary care, have a key role in supporting recovery from COVID-19. In this article, direct evidence from studies of COVID-19, and indirect evidence from studies of infections caused by other coronaviruses (eg SARS, MERS) and of the ICU experience are explored to identify the potential course of recovery and areas where nurses can help. Most people will have an uncomplicated recovery. However, it appears that a more complicated recovery is likely to be associated with severe disease. A minority, possibly those needing hospitalisation, and/or with pre-existing physical or psychological comorbidities, may experience long-term physical effects, fatigue and mental health difficulties. The support that nurses, as part of a multidisciplinary team, can provide to facilitate recovery is discussed.","Alexandra Barley, Coghlan","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2020.29.21.1272","20201126","COVID-19; Fatigue; Intensive care; Mental health; Recovery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7555,""
"The influence of COVID-19 measures in the United Kingdom on physical activity levels, perceived physical function and mood in older adults: A survey-based observational study","In March 2020, the spreading Coronavirus (COVID-19) prompted the United Kingdom government to introduce a societal shutdown, accompanied by self-isolation and social-distancing measures to reduce virus transmission. In doing so, opportunities for physical activity were likely reduced, potentially causing detrimental effects to older adults. Therefore, the present study investigated the influence of the initial six weeks of lockdown on physical activity levels, perceived physical function and mood in older adults. A cross-sectional, mixed-methods, observational study was conducted using self-administered, fortnightly online surveys throughout the UK between 21<sup>st</sup> March-4 May 2020. A total of 117 participants (52 males [age: 76Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4Ã‚Â years] and 65 females [age: 76Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4Ã‚Â years]) completed all surveys. Despite lockdown restrictions, this group of older adults maintained their pre-lockdown physical activity levels, but also increased their self-reported sedentary time. Subsequently, perception of physical function was maintained across lockdown. With regards to mood; the only strong evidence for an increase in depression was for males (psÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 95.35%; &gt;0.3 AU), although self-reported levels of depression were similar between sexes at week six. Given the link between sedentary behaviour and negative health outcomes in older adults, strategies to reduce sedentariness during the COVID-19 pandemic are required.","Richardson, Duncan, Clarke, Myers, Tallis","https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1850984","20201126","COVID-19; older adults; physical Activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7556,""

"An international survey of clinicians' experience caring for patients on home parenteral nutrition for chronic intestinal failure during the COVID-19 pandemic","This survey of centres caring for patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) was conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the management of these patients in terms of provision of care, monitoring, regular follow-up and any changes to service infrastructure. A survey was devised and publically published on the REDCap database management system with individual centres responding to a public link. 78 adult and paediatric centres worldwide contributed to the survey, representing at least 3500 patients' experience. Centres (n/78 unless otherwise specified, %) reported infrastructure maintenance for PN bag deliveries to patients (60, 76.92%) or delivery of ancillary items (dressing packs, gloves, bungs) (57, 73.08%) home delivery and HPN administration (65, 83.33%) but homecare nurse shortages (25, 32.05%). Follow up of routine HPN patients changed to either all telemed or mixed with emergency clinic review (70, 89.74%). In 26 centres (33.33%), new discharges on HPN for benign conditions were reduced or stopped. Based on clinical history the centres reported psychological distress for patients (52, 66.67%) with anxiety, worry, concern and apprehension reported most frequently (37/52, 71.15%) but also fear (10/52, 19.23%), depression (5/52, 9.62%) and issues related to isolation/confinement (12/52, 23.08%). The COVID-19 pandemic was reported by clinicians to have had a far reaching adverse impact on patients on home parenteral nutrition, especially their safety in terms of provision of PPE, PN bags, available nursing staff and psychological well-being.

"Effectiveness of Expressive Writing in the Reduction of Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Due to the wide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, the need for scalable interventions that can effectively reduce psychological distress has been recognized. Expressive writing (EW) can be beneficial for different conditions, including depression, suicidal ideation, and coping with trauma. Therefore, we aim to assess the applicability and effectiveness of an online format of EW in the reduction of psychological distress in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, participants (<i>n</i> = 120) were randomly allocated to (1) the intervention group-who completed five EW sessions over the 2 week period-or (2) the control group-who received treatment as usual (TAU). Participants were assessed for primary and secondary outcome measures at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up-1-month after the treatment. The primary outcome was severity of psychological distress assessed at post-treatment, operationalized as Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) summary score. Secondary outcomes were severity of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS subscale scores), well-being (WHO-5), subjective perception of quality of life (SQOL), and subjective evaluation of difficulties coping with pandemic, which were also assessed at post-treatment. Per protocol, analysis was conducted with available cases only. A less favorable outcome was found in the intervention group on psychological distress, and symptoms of stress, after controlling for baseline scores. Increased stress was recorded in the treatment group, with no effect in the control group. There was no significant difference between the groups on depression, anxiety, well-being, and subjective quality of life. No group effect for any of the outcomes measures was recorded at follow-up. Additional analysis revealed moderation effects of age and gender with older and male participants scoring higher on distress measures. Engaging in EW during the pandemic was found to elevate stress; thus, when applied in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be harmful. Hence, EW or similar self-guided interventions should not be applied without prior evidence on their effects in the context of a pandemic and similar stressful and unpredictable circumstances.

"Identifying Predictors of Psychological Distress During COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach","Scientific understanding about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is in its nascent stage. Prior research suggests that demographic factors, such as gender and age, are associated with greater distress during a global health crisis. Less is known about how emotion regulation impacts levels of distress during a pandemic. The present study aimed to identify predictors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (<i>N</i> = 2,787) provided demographics, history of adverse childhood experiences, current coping strategies (use of implicit and explicit emotion regulation), and current psychological distress. The overall prevalence of clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress was higher than the prevalence outside a pandemic and was higher than rates reported among healthcare workers and survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Younger participants (&lt;45 years), women, and non-binary individuals reported higher prevalence of symptoms across all measures of distress. A random forest machine learning algorithm was used to identify the strongest predictors of distress. Regression trees were developed to identify individuals at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Somatization and less reliance on adaptive defense mechanisms were associated with greater distress. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individuals' physical experiences of psychological distress and emotion regulation strategies to help mental health providers tailor assessments and treatment during a global health crisis.","Prout, Zilcha-Mano, Aafjes-van Doorn, BÃƒÂ©kÃƒÂ©s, Christman-Cohen, Whistler, Kui, Di Giuseppe","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.586202","20201126","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; defense mechanisms; depression; emotion regulation; machine learning; post-traumatic stress; somatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7560,""
"Factors Impeding Health-Care Professionals to Effectively Treat Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients in Pakistan: A Qualitative Investigation","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, first reported in late December 2019, is regarded as the most significant public health emergency of the century. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current outbreak of COVID-19 has affected millions of people and killed hundreds of thousands in more than 200 countries, including Pakistan. Health-care professionals (HCPs) cannot minimize human interactions or isolate themselves from patients due to their jobs and moral duties. Hence, the outbreak needed HCPs to work in adverse and challenging conditions with possible mental health problems. In light of the stated background, this study aims to explore and understand the factors that impede HCPs to effectively treat COVID-19 patients in Karachi, Pakistan. Based on qualitative methods, a phenomenological approach was considered to record the true experiences of HCPs. Twelve doctors and nurses were recruited from five COVID-19 designated hospitals in Karachi, Sindh Province, using purposive and snowball sampling. Semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews were conducted from April 6 to 14, 2020, and analyzed through thematic analysis. The findings suggest that there were two types of constraints, institutional and personal, which were impeding HCPs to treat COVID-19 patients effectively. Institutional constraints include the poor condition of isolation wards, inadequate availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), excessive and uneven workload, and absence of emotional and psychological support in hospitals. Besides, personal constraints include nervousness due to the novel virus, a constant fear of becoming infected, fear of taking virus to family, extreme isolation and loneliness, and feeling of powerlessness. The study found that HCPs in Pakistan have been dealing with a high risk of infection, causing mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. These mental health problems not only affect attention, understanding, and decision-making capacity of HCPs, which could hinder the fight against COVID-19, but they could also have a continuous effect on their overall well-being on a long-term basis. Therefore, the present study outlines important clinical and policy strategies that are needed to support HCPs as the pandemic continues.","Raza, Matloob, Abdul Rahim, Abdul Halim, Khattak, Ahmed, Nayab, Hakeem, Zubair","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.572450","20201126","COVID-19; Pakistan; health-care professionals; obstruction; qualitative investigation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7561,""
"Is It Just About Physical Health? An Online Cross-Sectional Study Exploring the Psychological Distress Among University Students in Jordan in the Midst of COVID-19 Pandemic","Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at national and international levels were directed to mitigate the spread of the disease and its physical harm, paying less attention to the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health especially at early stages of the pandemic. This study aimed to assess and explore (i) The levels of psychological distress and its correlates (ii) Motivation for distance learning (iii) Coping activities and pandemic related concerns, among university students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, while other questions have explored our study's second and third aims. A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (<i>n</i> = 199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). Concerning distress severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (<i>n</i> = 265, 69.5%). 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. Ordinal logistic regression revealed a significant correlation between distress severity and many predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as protective factors against higher levels of distress included older age (aOR = 0.64, <i>P</i> = 0.022; 95% CI: 0.44-0.94), and having a strong motivation for distance learning (aOR = 0.10, <i>P</i> = 0.048; 95% CI: 0.01-0.96). In contrary, being a current smoker (aOR = 1.99, <i>P</i> = 0.049; 95% CI: 1.10-3.39), and having no motivation for distance learning (aOR = 2.49, <i>P</i> = 0.007; 95% CI: 1.29-4.80) acted as risk factors for having higher levels of psychological distress among the students. The most common coping activity reported was spending more time on social media platforms (<i>n</i> = 269, 70.6%), and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning as their most distressing concern. The COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures could impact the mental health of individuals, including students.

"The Anxiety-Buffer Hypothesis in the Time of COVID-19: When Self-Esteem Protects From the Impact of Loneliness and Fear on Anxiety and Depression","The coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has spread worldwide, generating intense fear of infection and death that may lead to enduring anxiety. At the same time, quarantine and physical isolation can intensify feelings of dispositional loneliness that, by focusing on thoughts of disconnection from others, can trigger intense anxiety. Anxiety, generated by both fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness, can activate negative expectations and thoughts of death, potentially generating alarming depressive symptoms. However, the <i>anxiety-buffer hypothesis</i> suggests that self-esteem acts as a shield (buffer) against mental health threats - fear and loneliness - thus hampering anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study aims to test the process - triggered by COVID-19 fear and loneliness - in which self-esteem should buffer the path leading to anxiety symptoms, then to depression. An observational research design with structural equation models was used. A sample of 1200 participants enrolled from the general population answered an online survey comprising: the fear of COVID-19 scale, the UCLA loneliness scale, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and the anxiety and depression scales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Structural equation models showed the link between anxiety symptoms (<i>mediator</i>) with both the fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness (<i>predictors</i>), as well as its association with consequent depressive symptomatology (<i>outcome</i>). In line with the anxiety-buffer hypothesis, self-esteem mediated the relationship between the predictors and their adverse psychological consequences. Self-esteem represents a protective factor from the antecedents of depression. Targeted psychological interventions should be implemented to minimize the psychological burden of the disease whilst promoting adaptation and positive psychological health outcomes.","Rossi, Panzeri, Pietrabissa, Manzoni, Castelnuovo, Mannarini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02177","20201126","COVID-19; anxiety; anxiety buffer hypothesis; depression; fear; loneliness; self-esteem; terror management theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7563,""
"Mental Well-Being During Pandemic: The Role of Cognitive Biases and Emotion Regulation Strategies in Risk Perception and Affective Response to COVID-19","Both cognitive appraisals of risks associated with the specific disease and affective response to crisis situations have been shown to shape an individual response to pandemics. COVID-19 pandemic and measures introduced to contain it present an unparalleled challenge to mental well-being worldwide. Here, we examine the relationship between self-reported cognitive biases (CB) and emotion regulation skills (ER), COVID-19 risk perception and affective response, and mental well-being (MWB). Five Hundred and Eleven individuals completed General Health Questionnaire, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scale (DACOBS) as well as scales measuring COVID-19 risk perception and affective response during the initial days of the epidemic in Poland. We used path and bootstrapping analyses to examine the hypothesis that CB may shape MWB during COVID-19 pandemic both directly and indirectly by (i) decreasing ER capacity and (ii) by increasing COVID-19 risk perception and affective response. Negative effect of CB and positive effect of ER via cognitive reappraisal on MWB were observed in participants. Furthermore, in line with our hypothesis, we observed indirect effects of CB via increased COVID-19 risk perception and affective response and decreased use of reappraisal strategy, which all, in turn, were related to MWB. Finally, we found an indirect effect of CB on MWB through double mediation of suppression strategies and COVID-19 affective response. Results of the current study suggest that CB, which have been shown to be linked to a variety of mental health symptoms in non-clinical populations, may exacerbate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes.","Schudy, Ã…Â»urek, WiÃ…â€ºniewska, Piejka, GawÃˆÂ©da, Okruszek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589973","20201126","COVID-19; cognitive biases; emotion regulation; mental well-being; pandemic; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7564,""
"Social Frailty in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era","Special attention and efforts to protect from or reduce health-related outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus triggering coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), should be applied in susceptible populations, including frail older people. In particular, the early death cases occurred primarily in older people with a frailty status, possibly due to a weaker immune system fostering faster progression of the viral infection. Frailty is an age-related multidimensional clinical condition defined as a non-specific state of vulnerability, identifying older people at increased risk of falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, disability, dementia, and death. Among frailty phenotypes, social frailty has been least studied. It considers the role of socioeconomic context as a vulnerability status later in life. COVID-19 does not affect all populations equally, and social inequalities contribute to drive the spread of infections. It was known that the perception of social isolation, e.g., loneliness, affects mental and physical health, but the implicated molecular mechanisms, also related to the immune system, and its associated cognitive and health-related sequelae, are poorly understood. The increasing psychological distress derived by prolonged exposure to stress due to the lockdown scenario, and the reduced sources of support, contributed to making heavy demands on personal resources, i.e., self-efficacy and interpersonal variables. So, perceived loneliness may be a factor associated with psychological distress and an outcome in itself. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, a correct assessment of social frailty may be essential in terms of the prevention of late-life neuropsychiatric disorders.","Lozupone, La Montagna, Di Gioia, Sardone, Resta, Daniele, Giannelli, Bellomo, Panza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577113","20201126","Late-Life Depression (LLD); Multimorbidity (MM); SARS-CoV-2; biomarkers; coronavirus; immune system; loneliness; social dysfunction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7565,""
"A Network Analysis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Correlates During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background and Objective:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been suggested as a collective trauma, which presents a continuing crisis. However, the specific post-traumatic implication of this crisis has not been adequately studied yet. The current study was aimed to ascertain the most central symptom and the strong connections between symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At the same time, exploring the relationship between covariates and the network of PTSD symptoms, by taking sex, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, quality of life, and social support as covariates, may help us to know the arise and maintenance of PTSD symptoms and give specified suggestions to people under the shadow of COVID-19. <b>Method:</b> The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was used to assess the PTSD symptoms extent of 338 healthy participants over the past month. Networks were analyzed using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. In addition, the centrality of the symptoms and the robustness of the results were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The network analysis revealed that the especially strong connections emerged between avoidance of thoughts and avoidance of reminders, hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response, intrusive thoughts and nightmares, flashbacks and emotional cue reactivity, and detachment and restricted affect. The most central symptoms were self-destructive/reckless behavior. Incorporation of covariates into the network revealed the strong connections path between self-destructive/reckless behavior and loss of interest and depression. <b>Conclusion:</b> Self-destructive/reckless behavior was the most central symptom in the network of PTSD symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which as an important target of interfere may have great benefits.","Jiang, Ren, Yu, Tan, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.568037","20201126","centrality; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); network analysis; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); public; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7566,""

This is study aims to report the psychological impact of Covid-19 over time on the Spanish population. <b>Methods:</b> A longitudinal study (<i>N</i> = 1041) was carried out with two measurements: after 2 and 5 weeks starting from the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disease (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, variables about Covid-19, loneliness, spiritual well-being, social support, discrimination, and a sense of belonging were collected. <b>Results:</b> The data showed how depressive symptomatology increased significantly over time, while anxiety and PTSD did not show statistically significant changes. Spiritual well-being and loneliness were the main predictors of psychological impact. A younger age was a significant predictor of depression and anxiety, while female gender was associated with anxiety and PTSD. <b>Conclusions:</b> The impact of the pandemic is sustained over time, even increasing in depression, and vulnerable groups that need greater psychological health support could be identified.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Sanguino, AusÃƒÂ­n, Castellanos, Saiz, LÃƒÂ³pez-GÃƒÂ³mez, Ugidos, MuÃƒÂ±oz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565474","20201126","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; postraumatic stress disorder; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7567,""
"Psychosocial Correlates of Depression and Anxiety in the United Arab Emirates During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is likely to be significant. Identifying vulnerable groups during the pandemic is essential for targeting psychological support, and in preparation for any second wave or future pandemic. Vulnerable groups are likely to vary across different societies; therefore, research needs to be conducted at a national and international level. This online survey explored generalized anxiety and depression symptoms in a community sample of adults (<i>N</i> = 1,039) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between April 8th and April 22nd, 2020. Respondents completed symptom measures of depression (PHQ8) and generalized anxiety (GAD7), along with psychosocial and demographic variables that might potentially influence such symptoms. Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for the main study variables. Levels of anxiety and depression were notably higher than those reported in previous (pre-pandemic) national studies. Similar variables were statistically significantly associated with both depression and anxiety, most notably younger age, being female, having a history of mental health problems, self or loved ones testing positive for COVID-19, and having high levels of COVID-related anxiety and economic threat. Sections of the UAE population experienced relatively high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic. Several COVID-related and psychosocial variables were associated with heightened symptomatology. Identifying such vulnerable groups can help inform the public mental health response to the current and future pandemics.","Thomas, Barbato, Verlinden, Gaspar, Moussa, Ghorayeb, Menon, Figueiras, Arora, Bentall","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.564172","20201126","Arab; COVID-19; UAE; anxiety; depression; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7568,""
"Telepsychiatry in the Arab World: A Viewpoint Before and During COVID-19","Telepsychiatry, a subset of telemedicine, has been increasingly studied to meet the growing demands for psychiatric care. The utility of telepsychiatry is relevant now more than ever as the world endures the COVID-19 global pandemic. This paper describes the prior state and the changes that the COVID-19 outbreak brought to telepsychiatry in a selected group of Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. We invited twelve early-career psychiatrists from different Arab nations to share information related to telepsychiatry in their respective countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information was collected using a semi-structured guide. This was complemented by a search for relevant articles in five search engines using terms such as &quot;COVID-19,&quot; &quot;telepsychiatry,&quot; and &quot;Arab world&quot;. Before the pandemic, digital mental health services were provided in several Arab countries, mainly through hotlines and messaging services. The COVID-19 pandemic has marked a major shift in digital psychiatric services in the Arab MENA world, through the transformation of many clinics and some hospitals into digital mental health systems. Many non-governmental organizations also started remote initiatives for psychological support and psychiatric counseling. Three main barriers of patient-related, healthcare-related, and system-related hurdles of using telepsychiatry emanated from the analysis. The use of digital mental health services varies between different Arab countries. Even though some nations have laws that regulate the provision of such services, most struggle with multifactorial barriers. As affordable and attainable solutions cannot only rely on training and recruiting more psychiatrists, telepsychiatry would help meet the exceeding demands in the Arab world, particularly after the COVID-19 outbreak.","El Hayek, Nofal, Abdelrahman, Adra, Al Harthi, Al Shamli, AlNuaimi, Bensid, Cheaito, Emberish, Larnaout, Radwan, Slaih, Kobeissy, Bizri","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S277224","20201126","Arab; COVID-19; mental health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7569,""
"Moving singing for lung health online in response to COVID-19: experience from a randomised controlled trial","Singing for lung health (SLH) is a popular arts-in-health activity for people with long-term respiratory conditions. Participants report biopsychosocial benefits, however, research on impact is limited. The 'SLH: Improving Experiences of Lung Disease trial', a randomised controlled, single (assessor) blind, trial of 12 weeks SLH versus usual care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=120) was setup to help to address this. The first group (n=18, nine singing and nine controls) started face-to-face (five sessions) before changing to online delivery (seven sessions) due to COVID-19-related physical distancing measures. As such, the experience of this group is here reported as a pilot study to inform further research in this area. We conducted semistructured interviews and thematic analysis regarding barriers, facilitators and key considerations for transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative outcomes include attendance, premeasures and postmeasures of quality of life and disease impact (Short Form 36 Health Survey, COPD Assessment Test score), breathlessness (Medical Research Council breathlessness scale, Dyspnoea-12), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7), balance confidence (Activity specific Balance Confidence, ABC scale) and physical activity (clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD tool, combining subjective rating and actigraphy). Attendance was 69% overall, (90% of the face-to-face sessions, 53% online sessions). Analysis of semistructured interviews identified three themes regarding participation in SLH delivered face to face and online, these where (1) perceived benefits; (2) digital barriers (online) and (3) digital facilitators (online). Findings were summarised into key considerations for optimising transitioning singing groups from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative data suggested possible improvements in depression (treatment effect -4.78 PHQ-9 points, p&lt;0.05, MCID 5) and balance confidence (treatment effect +17.21 ABC scale points, p=0.04, MCID 14.2). This study identifies key considerations regarding the adaptation of SLH from face-to-face to online delivery.

"Psychometric properties of the moral injury symptom scale among Chinese health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Moral injury among physicians and other health professionals has attracted attention in the mainstream literature, this study aim to assess the psychometric properties of the 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional (MISS-HP) among healthcare professionals in China. A total of 583 nurses and 2423 physicians were recruited from across mainland China. An online survey was conducted from March 27 to April 26, 2020 (during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic) using the Chinese version of the MISS-HP. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to determine scale structure. Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± of the scale for both samples was acceptable (0.71 for nurses and 0.70 for physicians), as was test-retest reliability (ICCs for the individual items ranged from 0.41 to 0.74, with 0.77 for the overall scale in physicians). EFA suggested three factors, and the CFA indicated good fit to the data. Convergent validity was demonstrated with the 4-item Expressions of Moral Injury Scale (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.45 for physicians, rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.43 for nurses). Discriminant validity was demonstrated by correlations with burnout and well-being (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.34-0.47), and concurrent validity was suggested by correlations with depression and anxiety symptoms (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.37-0.45).

"COVID-19 related lockdown: a trigger from the pre-melancholic phase to catatonia and depression, a case report of a 59 year-old man","The pre-melancholic model described by Tellenbach may provide a common model for understanding the psychological implications of the lockdown. In this case report, we describe a rare catatonic status as a psychological implication linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, a really unique global situation. B is a 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°year-old man with mute psychiatric anamnesis whose mother suffered from a major depressive disorder. As the lockdown began, he started to develop concerns about his family's economic condition. According to his wife, he could see no end to the epidemic and no future at all. Moving from this, he started to show a severe and rapidly progressive depression and to develop mood congruent delusions. In addition, he had increasing anhedonia, apathy, starvation and insomnia. This turned in the end into a catatonic-like state, along with a deep desire to die. Admitted to the psychiatry ward in a state of mutism, he was discharged after 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°days with a diagnosis of &quot;Major depressive disorder, single severe episode with no psychotic behavior&quot;. He was treated with Sertraline, Olanzapine and Lorazepam. Our aim is to draw attention to the effect of the lockdown upon a Tellenbach-like personality structure. Identifying this type of pre-morbid personality structure could help clinicians understand and treat some cases of patients with severe major depressive disorders elicited by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sarli, Polidori, Lester, Pompili","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02978-2","20201126","Catatonia; Covid-19; Lockdown; Major depressive disorder; Typus Melancholicus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7572,""

"Psychological and Emotional Impact of Patients Living in Psychiatric Treatment Communities during Covid-19 Lockdown in Italy","Most studies on well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on the mental health of the general population; far less attention has been given to more specific populations, such as patients with mental illness. Indeed, it is important to examine the psychiatric population, given its vulnerability. The present study aimed at assessing the psychological and emotional impact of isolation on patients in Residential Rehabilitation Communities, compared to healthy controls. A questionnaire was administered cross-sectionally on an online survey platform and both psychiatric patients and healthy controls accessed via a designed link. The results showed significant differences between psychiatric patients and controls on Anxiety, Stress, Worry, and Risk Perception variables. Psychiatric patients scored lower on Stress compared to healthy controls and higher on Anxiety, Perceived Risk of getting infected with COVID-19 and Worry about the emergency situation. The results showed that, during the Italian lockdown, psychiatric patients living in residential communities received unbroken support from peers and mental health professionals, maintained their usual medication treatment, and were informed of COVID-19 consequences. This finding provides insight into the differences between residential and healthy populations and highlights the importance of continuous support for psychiatric patients, especially during stressful situations such as a pandemic.","Burrai, Roma, Barchielli, Biondi, Cordellieri, Fraschetti, Pizzimenti, Mazza, Ferracuti, Giannini","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113787","20201126","Covid-19; anxiety; coping; depression; mental illness; psychiatric patients; risk perception; stress; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7575,""
"Social Bots' Sentiment Engagement in Health Emergencies: A Topic-Based Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic Discussions on Twitter","During the COVID-19 pandemic, when individuals were confronted with social distancing, social media served as a significant platform for expressing feelings and seeking emotional support. However, a group of automated actors known as social bots have been found to coexist with human users in discussions regarding the coronavirus crisis, which may pose threats to public health. To figure out how these actors distorted public opinion and sentiment expressions in the outbreak, this study selected three critical timepoints in the development of the pandemic and conducted a topic-based sentiment analysis for bot-generated and human-generated tweets. The findings show that suspected social bots contributed to as much as 9.27% of COVID-19 discussions on Twitter. Social bots and humans shared a similar trend on sentiment polarity-positive or negative-for almost all topics. For the most negative topics, social bots were even more negative than humans. Their sentiment expressions were weaker than those of humans for most topics, except for COVID-19 in the US and the healthcare system. In most cases, social bots were more likely to actively amplify humans' emotions, rather than to trigger humans' amplification. In discussions of COVID-19 in the US, social bots managed to trigger bot-to-human anger transmission. Although these automated accounts expressed more sadness towards health risks, they failed to pass sadness to humans.","Shi, Liu, Yang, Zhang, Wen, Su","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228701","20201126","COVID-19 pandemic; health emergency; sentiment analysis; social bots; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7576,""

"Quality of life of Health care professionals in pandemic times","The COVID-19 pandemics were an event where there was a rupture of the life pattern and people felt helpless and suffering, creating a need for basic things such as medical care and shelter against the environmental conditions. The healthcare professionals faced an unknown potential threat to life that made them work in an intense and fearful routine facing fatigue and the fear to carry the disease to their families. In order to evaluate their Quality of life, we undertook a survey in the first months of the pandemics with logistical support of the Health ministry in Brazil reaching more than 200,000 varied health professionals, with quality of life data available to 97,379 . We segregated the professionals by their reported area in Medical doctor, psychologists, social worker, nurses, pharmaceutic/biochemistry, nutritionists, physiotherapist, and speech therapists. Here we describe the findings of the reported quality of life and the features more related to the worsening of the quality of life. The different professions report a diverse quality of life, suggesting a more heterogeneous pattern of impairment. The social relations domain of quality of life was the most affected in or sample Knowing the target population and the features related to worsening of quality of life might help to prepare the professionals for what they must face and to improve mental health in this population.","Jonas Jardim De Paula et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-D67-653","20201127","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-27","",7578,""
