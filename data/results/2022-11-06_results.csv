"Widening Racial Disparities During COVID-19 Telemedicine Transition: A Study of Child Mental Health Services at Two Large Children's Hospitals","To examined whether racial disparities in access to pediatric mental health care were impacted during the COVID-19 telemedicine transition at both The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Electronic health records were queried for all unique outpatient visits from a pre-pandemic period in 2019 and a within-pandemic period in 2020. Changes in the proportion of patients were compared based on insurance status, clinic location, and racial identification. Hypotheses were tested via logistic regression analyses. At CHOP, from 2019 to 2020, the proportion of racially minoritized patients significantly declined within a one-month period from 62% to 51% while the proportion of white-identifying patients increased from 38% to 49% (b =, 0.47; z-value, 3.60; p =0.0003), after controlling for insurance status and clinic location. At BCH, the proportion of racially-minoritized patients significantly declined within a longer six-month period between 2019 and 2020, from 62% to 59%, while the proportion of white-identifying patients increased from 38% to 41% (b=0.13; z-value=2.8; p=0.006), after controlling for insurance status. At CHOP and BCH, the COVID-19 telemedicine transition exacerbated pre-existing racial disparities in pediatric mental health services. Our findings may suggest that racially minoritized patients receiving services in urban areas may be particularly at risk of losing access when telemedicine is implemented. While there are limitations to this racial dichotomization, examining differences between white and racially-minoritized patients can highlight ways in which white-identifying have disproportionately received enhanced access to healthcare resources.","Williams, Ball, Roscoe, Harowitz, Hobbs, Raman, Seltzer, Vo, Cagande, Alexander-Bloch, Glahn, Morrow","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2022.07.848","20221105","pandemic; pediatrics; psychiatry; racial disparities; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40328,""
"When green enters a room: A scoping review of epidemiological studies on indoor plants and mental health","Increasing numbers of epidemiological studies are investigating the association between outdoor greenery and various health outcomes. However, in the case of indoor plants, although experimental studies seem relatively abundant, epidemiological studies remain scarce, and research considering the mental health effects is even more limited. Thus, we aim to identify and summarise the relevant epidemiological studies on indoor plant exposure and mental health via this scoping review, thereby presenting the current state of knowledge and research niches. PubMed and PsycINFO were systematically searched for epidemiological studies on indoor plant exposure and mental health, including mental and behavioural disorders, quality of life, and cognitive function. The publication period was from the inception of these two databases to 22nd June 2022. We extracted information on the relevant studies on exposure to indoor plants and mental health-related outcomes. The systematic search yielded 1186 unique results. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were finally included in this scoping review. All included studies were Europe-based cross-sectional studies on mental and behavioural disorders. One study was conducted in 2015 and investigated the office environment, whereas the other five were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on the home environment. Despite considerable heterogeneity in outcome assessments and indoor plant exposure metrics, all six studies generally reported beneficial associations between having indoor plants and mental health, such as reducing stress, depressive symptoms, and negative emotions. Epidemiological evidence on exposure to indoor plants and mental health is currently limited. In general, favourable effects of indoor plants are supported, although most relevant studies were conducted in the context of COVID-19. Before conducting more studies to explore the associations, data collection methods must be refined with more elaborate designs that allow for the measurement of more comprehensive metrics of indoor plants.

"Factors associated with post-stroke depression in the acute phase of ischemic stroke: A cross-sectional study","Ischemic stroke is a remarkable cause of death and disability worldwide. Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychiatric disturbance after stroke. Despite PSD being a potentially treatable condition, it still requires approaches to improve the early diagnosis. The present study aims to investigate the factors associated and correlated variables associated with PSD during hospitalization. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a specialized center of neurology in Santa Catarina, Brazil. 148 patients with acute ischemic stroke hospitalized between January 2020 and February 2021 were included. Sociodemographic, clinical and radiological variables were assessed during hospitalization. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was applied, as well as the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Factors associated were investigated through binary logistic regression and continuous variables through correlation tests. The prevalence of PSD during hospitalization was 31.1%. Factors associated with PSD in the acute phase of the stroke were female sex (OR: 2.6; CI 95%: 1.3-5.4; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) and post-stroke anxiety during hospitalization (OR: 4.9; CI 95%: 2.3-10.3; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01). The variables NIHSS, mRS, and stroke area were positively correlated with HADS - depression values. This research evidenced a high prevalence of PSD in the acute phase of stroke. Despite the study being conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency is similar to the non-pandemic periods. The research provided clues to identify and timely treat patients at greater risk of developing PSD during hospitalization.","Elias, Benevides, Martins, Martins, Marcos, Nunes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2022.107505","20221105","COVID-19; Depression; Post-stroke depression; Stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40330,""
"Associations between social COVID-19 exposure and psychological functioning","The negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have been widely reported, but less is known about how the impact of COVID-19 on others in one's social circle shapes these high distress levels. This study examines associations between social COVID-19 exposure-knowing someone who had a COVID-19 infection-and psychological functioning, as well as whether socio-demographic factors moderate these relationships. In June 2020, respondents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°343) from clinics in Tampa, Florida, U.S.A. reported whether they had social COVID-19 exposure, anxiety, depression, and stress, and other COVID-19-related concerns. Social COVID-19 exposure was associated with increased anxiety, stress, and concerns about a family member getting sick, and concerns about drinking and substance use. Several associations between exposure and psychological functioning were stronger in women, younger people, and people with lower income, implying these groups face elevated psychological risks due to the pandemic, and should be prioritized in mental health recovery efforts.","Lewicka, Hamilton, Waters, Orom, Schofield, Kiviniemi, Kanetsky, Hay","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-022-00374-7","20221105","COVID-19; COVID-19 concerns; Exploratory factor analysis (EFA); Moderation analyses; Psychological functioning; Social factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40331,""
"Examining the mental health of the academic community at an institution for higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Higher Education Institutions had to suspend their on-site activities and adapt to the new scenario. Therefore, the objective of the research was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the academic community of a Brazilian public university. This is a cross-sectional study, at a Brazilian public university, that used the baseline data from a longitudinal study carried out with employees and students. Participants answered a self-administered and confidential questionnaire in online platform, composed of sociodemographic, economic, lifestyles and mental health issues. 1,353 students and 372 employees participated. The prevalence of anxiety disorder symptoms among students and employees was 46.12% and 17.47%, depression 54.62% and 22.85% and stress 47.45% and 22.58%, respectively. The co-occurrence of symptoms was 33.56% among university students and 10.75% among employees. Falling family income, having stopped smoking and negative self-rated health, during the COVID-19 pandemic, may be the reasons for the high prevalence of co-occurrence of anxiety, depression and stress disorders among the academic community.","de Paula, Khouri, Machado, da Silva, Roever, Meireles","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2142946","20221105","COVID-19; Mental health; faculty; mental disorders; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40332,""
"Anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms &amp; associated factors among young to middle-aged adults during the resurgent epidemic of COVID-19: a cross-sectional study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern. However, its stress on the mental health of young to middle-aged adults is largely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the mental health difficulties during the resurgent phase of COVID-19 among young to middle-aged adults in China. There were 1,478 participants with a median age of 26Ã‚Â years (IQR, 23Ã‚Â -Ã‚Â 30), including 535 males (36.2%).

Education status, worried level about the current COVID-19, and the level of COVID-19's impact on life were significantly associated with the prevalence of anxiety. Besides, the level of COVID-19's impact on life was positively related to the prevalence of depression and insomnia.

"Disordered eating in female Indian students during the Covid-19 pandemic: The potential role of family","Within a paternalistic culture where weight is socially important and parental pressures are strong, 10 female Indian university students across various countries faced particular problems when living with their parents during the Covid-19 lockdowns. The current interview study examines why cultural and familial factors during the Covid-19 lockdown had such an impact on female Indian university students' food and exercise behaviors and self-view. Semi-structured, online (Microsoft Teams) interviews were conducted with 10 female Indian university students aged 20-23, who had moved back in with their parents during lockdown. The recorded and transcribed interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a contextualist orientation. Five themes were generated. Set within a context where eating and exercise habits are regulated by cultural and familial factors (Theme 1), lockdown living situations amplified these factors (Theme 2), severely impacting students' cognitions and affect (Theme 3), and relationships with their parents (Theme 4) even after lockdown was over. Participants' experiences led to greater awareness and motivation to confront their issues regarding body image and mental health (Theme 5). These findings have practical implications for counseling and eating disorder (ED) therapy in universities: Improved understanding of cultural and familial factors that affect female Indian students likely leads to better support. Our findings also emphasizes the need for research into the role of family and the impacts of family dynamics in the development of disordered eating habits. In Indian culture, eating and exercise habits tend to be regulated by cultural and familial factors. When female university students moved back in with their parents during the Covid-19 lockdowns, their living situation amplified these factors, severely impacting students' thoughts and feelings about their body, and relationships with their parents even after lockdown was over. The study has strong practical implications for university counseling settings and adds to research on the role of culture in how ED develops.","Amirapu, Brady-Van den Bos","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23846","20221105","Covid-19; Indian culture; Indian families; disordered eating habits; eating disorders; female Indian students; lockdown eating habits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40334,""
"The impact of the first UK COVID-19 lockdown on presentations with psychosis to mental health services for older adults: An electronic health records study in South London","Social distancing restrictions in the COVID-19 pandemic may have had adverse effects on older adults' mental health. Whereby the impact on mood is well-described, less is known about psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare characteristics associated with psychotic symptoms during the first UK lockdown and a pre-pandemic comparison period. In this retrospective observational study we analysed anonymised records from patients referred to mental health services for older adults in South London in the 16-week period of the UK lockdown starting in March 2020, and in the comparable pre-pandemic period in 2019. We used logistic regression models to compare the associations of different patient characteristics with increased odds of presenting with any psychotic symptom (defined as hallucinations and/or delusion), hallucinations, or delusions, during lockdown and the corresponding pre-pandemic period. 1991 referrals were identified. There were fewer referrals during lockdown but a higher proportion of presentations with any psychotic symptom (48.7% vs. 42.8%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.018), particularly hallucinations (41.0% vs. 27.8%, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Patients of non-White ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-2.99) and patients with dementia (adjusted OR: 3.09; 95% CI: 1.91-4.99) were more likely to be referred with psychotic symptoms during lockdown. While a weaker association between dementia and psychotic symptoms was found in the pre-COVID period (adjusted OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.19-2.03), interaction terms indicated higher odds of patients of non-White ethnicity or dementia to present with psychosis during the lockdown period. During lockdown, referrals to mental health services for adults decreased, but contained a higher proportion with psychotic symptoms. The stronger association with psychotic symptoms in non-White ethnic groups and patients with dementia during lockdown suggests that barriers in accessing care might have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Simkin, Yung, Greig, Perera, Tsamakis, Rizos, Stewart, Velayudhan, Mueller","https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5834","20221105","COVID-19; delusions; dementia; hallucinations; lockdown; non-white ethnicity; older adults; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40335,""
"A Pilot Study of Virtual Reality (VR) Tai Chi Program on Mental Health among Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Tai Chi, an ancient Chinese martial art, has been credited for improving the physical and mental health of community-dwelling older adults. Virtual reality (VR) has developed as a therapeutic technique for improving health and well-being in older adults. Previous research on exercise-based VR interventions in older adults has focused primarily on the physical and cognitive health effects. The extent to which a program integrating the ancient practice of Tai Chi with virtual reality might benefit older individuals' physical and mental health is an unknown entity. In this pilot study, we examined potential advantages of the virtual Tai Chi program in terms of health outcomes, as well as to gather qualitative data on the barriers to VR program participation. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 5 participants who had participated at least 5 years in traditional Tai Chi. Three key salient themes emerged as beneficial results of VR experiences: (1) mindfulness/ meditation, (2) enjoyment, and (3) physical exercise. Participants also reported 3 main challenges: (1) some difficulties with controllers and functions, (2) cybersickness/pain, and (3) absence of group synergy. These challenges suggest further avenues of investigation for researchers in refining this approach.","Kim, Kim, Chang, Min Oh, Han","https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.46.5.8","20221105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40336,""
"Self-management strategies and multicomponent training to mitigate the effects of the interruption of physical exercise programmes in the pandemic context on functionality, sedentary behaviour, physical capacity, mental health, body composition and quality of life in older adults: a blinded randomized controlled study protocol","Considering the confinement recommended by the World Health Organization due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, many community physical exercise programmes for older adults have had their activities cancelled. In this context, proposing strategies to recover the possible adverse effects of the confinement period is pertinent. The use of self-management strategies associated with regular physical activity reduces sedentary behaviour and improves physical capacity in older adults. Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe a multicomponent training programme combined with a self-management strategy protocol to mitigate the effects of interruptions in physical exercise programmes on functionality, physical capacity, mental health, body composition and quality of life in older adults. This will be a blinded, randomized and controlled clinical trial performed in SÃƒÂ£o Carlos, SP, Brazil. Eighty older adults will be divided into two groups: multicomponent training (Multi) and multicomponent training + self-management strategies (Multi+SM). The intervention will be performed over 16 weeks on three alternate days of every week, with 50-min sessions. The assessment of physical capacity will be performed before the interruption of physical exercise programmes (T0: initial assessment, March 2020), preintervention (T1: immediately after the return of the exercise programme) and postintervention (T2). The assessments of physical activity level, quality of life, mental health, functionality and body composition will be performed at T1 and T2. The results from this MC+SM protocol will allow us to contribute clinical support to evaluate the variables analysed and to guide future public health policies with the aim of minimizing the possible deleterious effects arising from the physical exercise interruption periods caused by epidemics and pandemics.

"An attempted ""suicide pact"" in Covid-19 era - psychiatric perspectives","A ""suicide pact"" is a joint and actively induced death of two individuals with the essential and unavoidable characteristic of a mutual consent. One of the partners (dominant in the relationship, commonly male) usually induces the action and in most cases, it is the one who actively carries it out. Undiagnosed psychopathological dimension or pathological subthreshold traits are found in those who enter into suicide agreements, the presence of cluster B personality traits such as narcissistic or borderline is of particular relevance in the dominant partner, while in the submissive one dependent personality traits are more frequent. As in the case of other similar health emergencies, COVID-19 pandemic seems to lead to greater suicidality, including the ""suicide pacts"" of couples whose motivation varies including firstly financial problems, strictly followed by fear of infection and not being able to return home from abroad. We reported a case of a couple who entered a suicide agreement consequently to the economic difficulties caused by COVID-19 pandemic, hospitalized in our department. Both partners were assessed with Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum) and both crossed the threshold for clinically relevant autistic traits (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°67; FÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49). This case further confirms the link between COVID-19 pandemics and suicidality. The role of autism spectrum traits as a vulnerability factor towards the development of severe psychopathological consequences after traumatic events is also stressed.","Nardi, Del Prete, Amatori, Carpita, Carmassi, Pompili, Dell'Osso","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04333-z","20221105","Autism spectrum; COVID-19; Psychological impact; Suicide; Suicide pact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40338,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health, daily and occupational activities among health professionals in Colombia: a national study","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented physical and mental burden on healthcare workers who are frequently at high risk of infection, particularly in low-income countries. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as changes in daily and occupational activities among healthcare professionals due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted between February and June 2021. The survey incorporated validated mental health tools such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale-10. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with severe mental health outcomes. Among 1345 healthcare workers the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress were 75.61, 59.18, and 53.09%, respectively. Anxiety (OR:1.44; 95%CI:1.16-1.8), depression (OR:1.74; 95%CI:1.27-2.37), and stress (OR:1.51; 95%CI:1.18-1.94) were more frequent in women, and individuals who expressed fear of a negative outcome (death, sequelae) (OR:2.25; 95%CI:1.60-3.25), (OR:1.49; 95%CI:1.03-2.16) and (OR:2.36; 95%CI:1.69-3.29) respectively. Age was negatively associated with anxiety (OR:0.98; 95%CI:0.98-0.99), stress (OR:0.98; 95%CI:0.97-0.99), and depression (OR:0.97; 95% CI:0.96-0.98).

"The effect of COVID-19 home quarantine on the psychological state of pharmacy students: a cross-sectional study","Psychological morbidity has been documented in medical and pharmaceutical undergraduate students in different countries around the world. In this study, we examined the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) home quarantine on the depressive psychological aspects of last-grade pharmacy students. A cross-sectional study was conducted by the Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Deraya University, Egypt. Two hundred and sixty-eight last-grade pharmacy students were included in this study, and they completed a self-administered, pre-designed, anonymous questionnaire. The main outcome measures were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which were measured to screen for the symptoms of psychological depression and determine the degree of depression severity between the beginning and the end of the COVID-19 home quarantine period. Data entry and analysis were done using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 26. Descriptive statistics were employed for analyses of the data, and categorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine relations between demographic data and psychological scales. The study protocol was approved by the Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University Ethical Committee. A total of 268 students participated in this study (102 males and 166 females). The meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD score of baseline HRS and HRS at the end of the study was 6.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.45, 7.95Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.36, respectively, with the presence of a statistically significant difference between the two scores (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

The results showed that the COVID-19 home quarantine period led to a depressive psychological effect on the students in this study. Students' psychological depression causes morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. Psychological depressive problems were significantly associated with the COVID-19 home quarantine period, which calls for early intervention to solve it. Student counselling services must be more accessible and affordable to overcome this problem.","Mohamed, Abdelrahman, Ahmad, Abdel Aziz, Mesameh, Mohamad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-022-00472-6","20221105","COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Pharmacy; Quarantine; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40340,""
"Using Technology to Limit the Impacts of Isolation on Youth in Inpatient Psychiatry Units","The COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a mental health crisis for children and adolescents in America.<sup>1</sup> Social isolation and loneliness during the pandemic present a significant challenge. A rapid systematic review published in this journal found that social isolation correlates with depression and anxiety and may heighten the risk of disorder onset.<sup>2</sup> Specifically in an infectious disease context, research on the H1N1 influenza pandemic showed that children in North America required to quarantine were 5 to 30 times more likely to meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder than children not under these restrictions.<sup>2</sup>.","Hanss, Carcana, Rice","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2022.07.833","20221104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40341,""
"Long-COVID and comorbid depression and anxiety two years into the COVID-19 pandemic","Long-COVID, or the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms for months after initial infection, has been shown to impact the lives of those affected. The current study sought to investigate the relationships between long-COVID, COVID-19 related stress, depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety outcomes. Data were collected in Winter 2021-2022 from a population of adults enrolled in at least one course across multiple City University of New York (CUNY) campuses. Frequencies and chi-square tests were computed to assess for demographics and relationships to probable diagnoses of depression and anxiety, and binary logistic regressions were computed to assess for the odds of probable comorbid depression and anxiety based on demographics, stressors, and long-COVID. Women participants reported higher odds of probable depression outcomes, and stressor levels were significant correlates of probable anxiety outcomes. Women participants, 3.2 [1.5-6.9], as compared to men, lower-SES participants, 2.16 [1.1-4.2], as compared to higher-SES participants, participants with higher COVID-19 related stress levels, 4.8 [2.0-12.0], as compared to those with low levels, and participants with long-COVID, 3.7 [1.9-7.0], as compared to those without, all had higher odds of probable comorbid depression and anxiety. Findings highlight the importance of social location, stress, and long-COVID, in tandem, as correlates of psychological health during the shifting pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114924","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-06","",40342,""
