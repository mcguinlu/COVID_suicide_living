"Longitudinal changes in physical activity during and after the first national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England","Background: Recent studies have shown reduced physical activity at early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of investigation on longitudinal changes in physical activity beyond lockdowns and stay at home orders. Moreover, it is unclear if there is heterogeneity in physical activity growth trajectories. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of physical activity and factors associated with them. Methods: Data were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 35,915 adults in England who were followed up for 22 weeks from 24th March to 23rd August 2020. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. Findings: Our analyses identified six classes of growth trajectories, including three stable classes showing little change over time (62.4% in total), two classes showing decreasing physical activity (28.6%), and one class showing increasing physical activity over time (9%). A range of factors were found to be associated the class membership of physical activity trajectories, such as age, gender, education, income, employment status, and health. Interpretation: There is substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal changes in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a substantial proportion of our sample showed persistent physical inactivity or decreasing physical activity. Given the well-established linked between physical activity and health, persistent or increased physical inactivity is likely to have both immediate and long-term implications for people's physical and mental health, as well as general wellbeing. More efforts are needed to promote physical activity during the pandemic and beyond.","Feifei Bu; Jessica K Bone; John Mitchell; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.21.21255861","20210425","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-26","",13166,""
"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among the Adult Population in Bangladesh: A Nationally Representative Cross-sectional Survey","Introduction: The study related to the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is scanty in the context of Bangladesh, despite the growing necessity of understanding the mass people's vaccination-related behavior. Thus, the present study was conducted to assess the prevalence of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Bangladesh to fill the knowledge gap. Methodology: This study adopted a cross-sectional study design to collect data from 1497 respondents using online (Google forms) and face-to-face interviews. We employed descriptive statistics and multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis. Findings: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 41.1%. Men had less hesitancy ({beta} = -0.046, p = 0.030) than women. The Muslims ({beta} = 0.057, p = 0.009) and the respondents living in the city corporation areas ({beta} = 0.132, p <0.001) had more hesitancy. There was significant variation in vaccine hesitancy by administrative divisions (geographic regions). The vaccine hesitancy tended to decrease with increasing knowledge about the vaccine ({beta} = -0.072, p=0.001) and vaccination process ({beta}= -0.058, p = 0.018). On the other hand, hesitancy increased with the increased negative attitudes towards vaccine ({beta} = 0.291, p <0.001) and conspiracy beliefs towards the COVID-19 vaccine ({beta} = 0.105, p=0.004). The perceived severity ({beta} = -0.079, p=0.002) and benefits ({beta} = -0.180, p=0.001) were negatively associated with hesitancy, while perceived barriers ({beta} = 0.180, p <0.001) were positively associated. The participants were more hesitant to accept the vaccine from a specific manufacturer. Conclusion: This study emphasizes that negative attitudes and conspiracies towards the COVID-19 vaccine should be reduced through effective communications and contracting with additional vaccine manufacturers should be prioritized. The barriers like online registration for receiving the COVID-19 vaccination need to be removed, and initiatives like text message service using the mobile phone operator can be introduced.","Mohammad Bellal Hossain; Md.

"Learning from the resilience of hospitals and their staff to the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge strain on hospitals worldwide. It is crucial that we gain a deeper understanding of hospital resilience in this unprecedented moment. This paper aims to report the key strategies and recommendations in terms of hospitals and professionals' resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the quality and limitations of research in this field at present. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the resilience of hospitals and their staff during the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of 2020. The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library website was used to identify papers meeting the eligibility criteria, from which we selected 65 publications. After having extracted data, we presented the results synthesis using an ""effects-strategies-impacts"" resilience framework. Results: We found a wealth of research rapidly produced in the first half of 2020, describing different strategies used to improve hospitals' resilience, particularly in terms of 1) planning, management, and security, and 2) human resources. Research focuses mainly on interventions related to healthcare workers' well-being and mental health, protection protocols, space reorganization, personal protective equipment and resources management, work organization, training, e-health and the use of technologies. Hospital financing, information and communication, and governance were less represented in the literature. Conclusion: The selected literature was dominated by quantitative descriptive case studies, sometimes lacking consideration of methodological limitations. The review revealed a lack of holistic research attempting to unite the topics within a resilience framework. Research on hospitals resilience would benefit from a greater range of analysis to draw more nuanced and contextualized lessons from the multiple specific responses to the crisis. We identified key strategies on how hospitals maintained their resilience when confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic and a range of recommendations for practice.","Lola Traverson; Jack Stennett; Isadora Mathevet; Amanda Correia Paes Zacarias; Karla Paz de Sousa; Andrea Andrade; Kate Zinszer; Valery Ridde","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.22.21255908","20210425","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-26","",13168,""
"College student interest in teletherapy and self-guided mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened college studentsâ€™ mental health while simultaneously creating new barriers to traditional in-person care. Teletherapy and online self-guided mental health supports are two potential avenues for addressing unmet mental health needs when face-to-face services are less accessible, but little is known about factors that shape interest in these supports. Participants: 1,224 U.S. undergraduate students (mean age=20.7; 72.5% female; 40.0% White) participated. Methods: Students completed an online questionnaire assessing interest in teletherapy and self-guided supports. Predictors included age, sex, ethnicity, sexual minority status, and anxiety and depression symptomatology. Results: Interest rates were 20% and 25% for at-cost supports and 70% and 72% for free supports. Older age, higher anxiety symptomatology, and identifying as Asian significantly predicted greater interest levels. Conclusions: Results may inform universitiesâ€™ efforts to optimize studentsâ€™ engagement with nontraditional, digital mental health supports, including teletherapy and self-guided programs.","Isaac Ahuvia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46113-D09-BA3","20210425","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-26","",13169,""
"Brief Report: Predictors of Adolescent Mental Health and Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose: This study explored predictors of COVID-19-related stress and wellbeing of Scottish adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown to identify potentially malleable risk and protective factors. Methods: 5,548 participants were surveyed regarding stress, loneliness, wellbeing, schoolwork, support from school, and interaction with friends and family. Multiple linear regressions within a structural equation modelling framework were fit to predict COVID-19-related stress and wellbeing during the UKâ€™s first lockdown. Results: Loneliness, variables related to the ability to continue with schoolwork, and perceived support from school were important predictors of greater COVID-19-related stress and wellbeing during the first lockdown. Female adolescents were also more likely to show higher stress and poorer wellbeing. Conclusions: Facilitating meaningful social interaction and ensuring the ability to continue with schoolwork, and providing social support from school should be priority strategies to help protect the mental health and wellbeing of secondary school students during lockdowns and other disruptions to school attendance.","Mina Murat Baldwin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46036-F44-5BF","20210425","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; wellbeing; covid-19 pandemic; stress; adolescents; lockdown","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-26","",13170,""
