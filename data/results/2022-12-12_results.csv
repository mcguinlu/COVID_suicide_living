"Mental health self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective cohort study in Australia","Pandemic public health measures have affected mental health for many people, resulting in varied approaches to mental health self-care. During 27 April - 26 July 2020, we surveyed a cohort of 1646 Australians, who were in paid employment prior to the pandemic, on changes in work, health, and managing their mental health concerns. Lifestyle changes were most the most frequently reported action to manage mental health concerns (78%), and were more common for women (OR=2.33, 95%CI=[1.82, 3.03]), and people experiencing recent work loss (OR=1.54, 95%CI=[1.04, 2.28]). Mental health self-care was more common for people experiencing psychological distress, or with pre-exisiting mental health conditions. Talking to friends about mental health, exercise and dietary changes, were more common for women and younger adults. Findings highlight potential benefits of reducing barriers to formal mental health services and supports during crises, particularly for people who less commonly seek help, and those experiencing psychological distress.","Daniel Griffiths; Vinsensia Maharani Kanya Dhira Pradipta; Alex Collie","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.08.22283265","20221209","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42226,""
"Exploring the psychosocial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on women's perinatal experiences and wellbeing: A qualitative study","While many studies have investigated the clinical impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on pregnant women's mental health, little attention has been paid to the exploration of women's experiences during the perinatal period from a psychosocial perspective in the Italian context. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the psychosocial changes associated with the pandemic in the perinatal context. Twenty-one Italian women who gave birth between March and November 2020 took part in this research by participating in semi-structured interviews, exploring their childbirth experiences. Our data were analysed using a Grounded Theory approach. Our findings revealed the enhanced importance of social support as a protective factor against uncertainties, which strongly characterised all phases of the perinatal period during the pandemic. Such uncertainties were mainly linked to the discontinuity in intrapartum care, as well as to concerns of being infected with Covid-19 combined with other pregnancy-specific worries. The main sources of social support were represented by loved ones - most of all partners - along with health care staff and peer networks. Our results suggest the importance of implementing evidence-based policies and interventions to improve women's wellbeing in the perinatal period during the pandemic, as well as of guaranteeing intrapartum care continuity and the presence of social support.","Mari, Capasso, Caso","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.srhc.2022.100805","20221211","Covid-19 pandemic; Grounded theory; Intrapartum care; Perinatal experiences; Psychosocial wellbeing; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42227,""
"A Nationally Representative Survey of COVID-19 in Pakistan, 2021-2022","We conducted 4,863 mobile phone and 1,715 face-to-face interviews of adults &gt;18 years residing in Pakistan during June 2021-January 2022 that focused on opinions and practices related to COVID-19. Of those surveyed, 26.3% thought COVID-19 was inevitable, and 16.8% had tested for COVID-19. Survey participants who considered COVID-19 an inevitability shared such traits as urban residency, concerns about COVID-19, and belief that the virus is a serious medical threat. Survey respondents who had undergone COVID-19 testing shared similarities regarding employment status, education, mental health screening, and the consideration of COVID-19 as an inevitable disease. From this survey, we modeled suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases and found nearly 3 times as many suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases than had been reported. Our research also suggested undertesting for COVID-19 even in the presence of COVID-19 symptoms. Further research might help uncover the reasons behind undertesting and underreporting of COVID-19 in Pakistan.","Aheron, Victory, Imtiaz, Fellows, Gilani, Gilani, Reed, Hakim","https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2813.220728","20221211","COVID-19; Pakistan; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease; respiratory infections; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survey; vaccine-preventable diseases; viruses; zoonoses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42228,""
"Intelligent System for Detecting Deterioration of Life Satisfaction as Tool for Remote Mental-Health Monitoring","The research described in this article is a continuation of work on a computational model of quality of life (QoL) satisfaction. In the proposed approach, overall life satisfaction is aggregated to personal life satisfaction (PLUS). The model described in the article is based on well-known and commonly used clinimetric scales (e.g., in psychiatry, psychology and physiotherapy). The simultaneous use of multiple scales, and the complexity of describing the quality of life with them, require complex fuzzy computational solutions. The aim of the study is twofold: (1) To develop a fuzzy model that allows for the detection of changes in life satisfaction scores (data on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in the neighboring country were used). (2) To develop more detailed guidelines than the existing ones for further similar research on more advanced intelligent systems with computational models which allow for sensing, detecting and evaluating the psychical state. We are concerned with developing practical solutions with higher scientific and clinical utility for both small datasets and big data to use in remote patient monitoring. Two exemplary groups of specialists at risk of occupational burnout were assessed three times at different intervals in terms of life satisfaction. The aforementioned assessment was made on Polish citizens because the specific data could be gathered: before and during the pandemic and during the war in Ukraine (a neighboring country). That has a higher potential for presenting a better analysis and reflection on the practical application of the model. A research group (physiotherapists, n = 20) and a reference group (IT professionals, n = 20) participated in the study. Four clinimetric scales were used for assessment: the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10), the Maslach Burnout Scale (MBI), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ). The assessment was complemented by statistical analyses and fuzzy models based on a hierarchical fuzzy system. Although several models for understanding changes in life satisfaction scores have been previously investigated, the novelty of this study lies in the use of data from three consecutive time points for the same individuals and the way they are analyzed, based on fuzzy logic. In addition, the new hierarchical structure of the model used in the study provides flexibility and transparency in the process of remotely monitoring changes in people's mental well-being and a quick response to observed changes. The aforementioned computational approach was used for the first time.","Prokopowicz, Miko&#x142;ajewski, Miko&#x142;ajewska","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22239214","20221211","COVID-19; burnout; computational model; fuzzy logic; intelligent systems; life satisfaction; predictive analytics; quality of life; remote monitoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42229,""
"The Significance of COVID-19 Diseases in Lipid Metabolism Pregnancy Women and Newborns","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Elderly people, people with immunodeficiency, autoimmune and malignant diseases, as well as people with chronic diseases have a higher risk of developing more severe forms of the disease. Pregnant women and children can becomesick, although more often they are only the carriers of the virus. Recent studies have indicated that infants can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and develop a severe form of the disease with a fatal outcome. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) ina pregnant woman can affect the supply of oxygen to the fetus and initiate the mechanism of metabolic disorders of the fetus and newborn caused by asphyxia. The initial metabolic response of the newborn to the lack of oxygen in the tissues is the activation of anaerobic glycolysis in the tissues and an increase in the concentration of lactate and ketones. Lipid peroxidation, especially in nerve cells, is catalyzed by iron released from hemoglobin, transferrin and ferritin, whose release is induced by tissue acidosis and free oxygen radicals. Ferroptosis-inducing factors can directly or indirectly affect glutathione peroxidase through various pathways, resulting in a decrease in the antioxidant capacity and accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells, ultimately leading to oxidative cell stress, and finally, death. Conclusion: damage to the mitochondria as a result of lipid peroxidation caused by the COVID-19 disease can cause the death of a newborn and pregnant women as well as short time and long-time sequelae.","Jovandaric, Dokic, Babovic, Milicevic, Dotlic, Milosevic, Culjic, Andric, Dimic, Mitrovic, Beleslin, Nikolic, Jestrovic, Babic","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232315098","20221211","COVID-19; lipid peroxidation; newborn; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42230,""
"The Connection between Gut and Lung Microbiota, Mast Cells, Platelets and SARS-CoV-2 in the Elderly Patient","The human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 that emerged in late 2019 causes a respiratory tract infection and has currently resulted in more than 627 million confirmed cases and over 6.58 million deaths worldwide up to October 2022. The highest death rate caused by COVID-19 is in older people, especially those with comorbidities. This evidence presents a challenge for biomedical research on aging and also identifies some key players in inflammation, including mast cells and platelets, which could represent important markers and, at the same time, unconventional therapeutic targets. Studies have shown a decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota composition in the elderly, particularly a reduced abundance of butyrate-producing species, and COVID-19 patients manifest faecal microbiome alterations, with an increase in opportunistic pathogens and a depletion of commensal beneficial microorganisms. The main purpose of this narrative review is to highlight how an altered condition of the gut microbiota, especially in the elderly, could be an important factor and have a strong impact in the lung homeostasis and COVID-19 phenomenon, jointly to the activation of mast cells and platelets, and also affect the outcomes of the pathology. Therefore, a targeted and careful control of the intestinal microbiota could represent a complementary intervention to be implemented for the management and the challenge against COVID-19.","Traina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314898","20221211","SARS-CoV-2; aging; immune protection; inflammation; intestinal microbiota; mast cells; platelets","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42231,""
"Is the Pandemic Wearing Us Out? A Cross-Sectional Study of the Prevalence of Fatigue in Adult Twins without Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection","During the pandemic, mental health was not only impaired in people after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also in people without previous infection. This is the first study on twins without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate the influence of genetic components and shared as well as individual environments on pandemic-associated fatigue. The study sample included 55 monozygotic and 45 dizygotic twin pairs. A total of 34.5% reported an increase in fatigue since the pandemic. A significant correlation was shown between the responses within monozygotic (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>[1] = 11.14, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and dizygotic pairs (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>[1] = 18.72, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). In all pandemic-associated fatigue dimensions, individual environment (ranging from e<sup>2</sup> = 0.64 to e<sup>2</sup> = 0.84) and heritability (ranging from h<sup>2</sup> = 0.32 to h<sup>2</sup> = 1.04) seem to have the highest impact. The number of comorbidities significantly correlated with physical fatigue (Spearman's <i>&#x3c1;</i> = 0.232, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and psychological impairment due to pandemic measures with the total fatigue score (Spearman's <i>&#x3c1;</i> = 0.243, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). However, calculated ANCOVAs with these significant correlations as covariates showed no significant influence on the mean values of the respective fatigue dimensions. Susceptibility to pandemic-associated fatigue may be genetically and environmentally determined, while intensity is also influenced by individual components. The prevalence of fatigue is high even in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future mental health prevention and intervention programs should be implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic on the global population.","Rupp, Weimer, Goebel-Stengel, Enck, Zipfel, Stengel","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11237067","20221211","brain fog; mental health; psychosomatic; somatoform; twins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42232,""

"Residential Environment Assessment by Older Adults in Nursing Homes during COVID-19 Outbreak","The most vulnerable residential settings during the COVID-19 pandemic were older adult's nursing homes, which experienced high rates of incidence and death from this cause. This paper aims to ascertain how institutionalized older people assessed their residential environment during the pandemic and to examine the differences according to personal and contextual characteristics. The COVID-19 Nursing Homes Survey (Madrid region, Spain) was used. The residential environment assessment scale (EVAER) and personal and contextual characteristics were selected. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis were applied. The sample consisted of 447 people (mean age = 83.8, 63.1% = women, 50.8% = widowed, 40% = less than primary studies). Four residential assessment subscales (relationships, mobility, residential aspects, privacy space) and three clusters according to residential rating (medium-high with everything = 71.5% of cases, low with mobility = 15.4%, low with everything = 13.1%) were obtained. The logistic regression models for each cluster category showed to be statistically significant. Showing a positive affect (OR = 1.08), fear of COVID-19 (OR = 1.06), high quality of life (OR = 1.05), not having suspicion of depression (OR = 0.75) and performing volunteer activities (OR = 3.67) were associated with the largest cluster. It is concluded that a better residential evaluation was related to more favourable personal and contextual conditions. These results can help in the design of nursing homes for older adults in need of accommodation and care to facilitate an age-friendly environment.","Rojo-Perez, Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Fernandez-Mayoralas, S&#xe1;nchez-Gonz&#xe1;lez, Perez de Arenaza Escribano, Rojo-Abuin, Forjaz, Molina-Mart&#xed;nez, Rodriguez-Blazquez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192316354","20221211","COVID-19; Madrid region; Spain; long-term care settings; older adults; residential assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42234,""
"Perception of Current Educational Environment, Clinical Competency, and Depression among Malaysian Medical Students in Clinical Clerkship: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the educational environment of medical students in clinical clerkship, with potential impacts on clinical competency and reported increased prevalence of depression. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the perception of the educational environment, self-perceived clinical competency, and depression among them. Subjects (<i>N</i> = 196) at the National University of Malaysia participated through convenience sampling in an online survey including sociodemographic data, COVID-19-related stressors, Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM), self-perceived clinical competency, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The cut-off point for depression was a PHQ-9 score &#x2265; 15. Multiple logistic regression followed bivariate analyses to identify factors for depression. The participants (mean age: 23.2 years, SD &#xb1; 0.98 years) were mainly female (71.9%) and Malay (59.2%). The prevalence of depression was 17.4% (95% CI: 12.3-23.4%). Most participants perceived the educational environment positively. In logistic regression, ethnicity (Adjusted OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.2-8.1) and DREEM score were significantly associated with depression, whereas self-perceived clinical competency was not. A higher DREEM score indicating a better perception of the educational environment was linked to a lower likelihood of depression (<i>p</i> = 0.046). Besides ethnicity, perception of the educational environment emerged as a factor associated with depression.

"Age-Based Differences in Sleep Quality, Pre-Sleep Arousal, and Psychosocial Factors during the Second Wave Lockdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Georgia-A Higher Vulnerability of Younger People","The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply disrupted sleep and mental health of people around the world. We aimed to investigate age-based differences in the prevalence of and relationship between sleep quality, pre-sleep arousal, and psychosocial factors during the second wave lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia. Data were collected through an online survey (<i>n</i> = 1117). Participants were categorized into four age groups: 18-29, 30-41, 42-53, and 54-70 years. The youngest participants reported the most prevalent disruption of sleep behavior. Overall, 58.3% of respondents were poor sleepers. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score was highest in the youngest age group but the difference was not significant. There was a significant difference in the PSQI component scores for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and daytime dysfunction, all being worse in young respondents. We also observed a significantly higher prevalence rate of worse sleep quality in the youngest age group, relative to the pre-pandemic period. On the other hand, the oldest respondents showed significantly greater use of sleeping medications. Significantly higher levels of somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal, perceived stress, feeling depressed, anxious, and socially isolated were reported by the youngest age group. Study findings indicate a higher vulnerability of younger people to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Urban Residents-Evidence from China","Based on a nationwide micro-survey in China from 2018 to 2021, this paper empirically estimates the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Chinese residents, by exploiting the distribution of the outflow population from Wuhan as an instrumental variable (IV). Our findings suggest that for every 10% increase in the cumulative confirmed cases, the number of mentally unhealthy days reported by urban residents in the past 30 days will increase by 2.19, an increase of 46.90% compared with the mean value. The impact is more significant among females, people aged 30 or above, and private-sector employees. Further evidence highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residents' expectations of future income and confidence in macroeconomic development, both of which we interpret as mechanisms related to economic concerns. In addition, application of the multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) strategy revealed that the negative impact still exists two years post-pandemic, but it has been dramatically alleviated since the initial stage.","Cui, Han","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192316190","20221211","COVID-19 pandemic; instrumental variable; long-term effect; mechanism analysis; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42237,""
"Validation of the Spanish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Long-Term Care Settings","Fear of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the main psychological impacts of the actual pandemic, especially among the population groups with higher mortality rates. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) has been used in different scenarios to assess fear associated with COVID-19, but this has not been done frequently in people living in long-term care (LTC) settings. The present study is aimed at measuring the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the FCV-19S in residents in LTC settings, following both the classical test theory (CTT) and Rasch model frameworks. The participants (n = 447), aged 60 years or older, were asked to complete the FCV-19S and to report, among other issues, their levels of depression, resilience, emotional wellbeing and health-related quality of life with validated scales. The mean FCV-19S score was 18.36 (SD 8.28, range 7-35), with higher scores for women, participants with lower education (primary or less) and higher adherence to preventive measures (all, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). The Cronbach's alpha for the FCV-19S was 0.94. After eliminating two items due to a lack of fit, the FCV-19S showed a good fit to the Rasch model (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup> (20) = 30.24, <i>p</i> = 0.019, PSI = 0.87), with unidimensionality (binomial 95% CI 0.001 to 0.045) and item local independency. Question 5 showed differential item functioning by sex. The present study shows that the FCV-19S has satisfactory reliability and validity, which supports its use to effectively measure fear in older people living in LTC settings. This tool could help identify risk groups that may need specific health education and effective communication strategies to lower fear levels. This might have a beneficial impact on adherence to preventive measures.","C&#xe1;rdenas Soriano, Rodriguez-Blazquez, Forjaz, Ayala, Rojo-Perez, Fernandez-Mayoralas, Molina-Martinez, de Arenaza Escribano, Rodriguez-Rodriguez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192316183","20221211","COVID-19; Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S); Rasch analysis; classical test theory; fear; long-term care; older people; psychometric properties","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42238,""
"The Associations of Communal Space with Sense of Place and Mental Health in Public Housing: Evidence from Guangzhou and Hong Kong","Communal space is regarded as essential for human well-being in high-rise developments in Asia and increasing attention has been given to the underlying mechanism of its effects in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. From the perspective of person-place processes, this paper explores 'sense of place' and its possible mediating effects on the relationship between communal space and the mental health of residents in high-rise public housing. An analysis of data from a questionnaire survey conducted in Hong Kong and Guangzhou revealed differentiated mechanisms according to local context and age group. Sense of place and its subcomponents mediated the connection between communal space and mental health in Hong Kong but not in Guangzhou.

The home-based nature of the work caused by lockdown restrictions revealed a transparency not found in office-based work, whilst simultaneously, evoking some discomfort. The ease with which infants and young children embraced technology worked in favor of using the online space. Playful, restorative, and creative ways of engaging with a highly vulnerable cohort of families were achieved; enhancing relational repair following both family violence and the isolation created by restrictions imposed by lockdowns. Despite an initial hesitancy to move online, the authors discovered meaningful ways through which to engage, treat and provide safe relational repair work with infants and their mothers impacted by family violence.","Bunston, Haufe, Wallis, Fletcher, Mether","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192316143","20221211","COVID 19 pandemic; domestic and family violence; groupwork; infant mental health; online therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42241,""
"Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Hospital Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Hospital-Based Repeated Measures Study","Although many studies have investigated burnout, stress, and mental health issues among health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic, few have linked these relationships to chronic physiological illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases. This study assessed changes in cardiovascular risk factors in HCWs and other hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and identified vulnerable groups at a higher risk of increased adverse cardiovascular conditions. Five hundred and fourteen hospital employees &#x2265; 20 years of age underwent physical examinations and laboratory testing once before and once after the first wave of the pandemic in Taiwan during 2020 and 2021. Their sociodemographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, blood biochemical parameters, and body mass index, were collected. The differences between pre- and post-pandemic measurements of their biophysical and blood biochemical parameters were analyzed using pairwise tests. The post-pandemic increases in their parameter levels and cardiovascular risk as a function of underlying factors were estimated from multivariate regressions. HCWs showed significant increases in levels and abnormal rates of BMI, blood pressure, plasma glucose, and total cholesterol after the pandemic. Post-pandemic increases in BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure were higher in females than in males. Workers with higher levels of education or longer job tenure had greater increases in BMI, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels than other workers. Females had a higher incidence of abnormal BMI and hypertension than males (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] of 8.3 and 2.9, respectively). Older workers' incidence of hypertension was higher than younger workers' (AOR = 3.5). Preventive strategies should be implemented for HCWs susceptible to cardiovascular diseases during emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","Liao, Lai, Lin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192316114","20221211","cardiovascular diseases; health care workers; metabolic syndrome; pandemic; work stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42242,""
"Key Predictive Factors in the Mental Health of Chinese University Students at Home and Abroad","The prevalence of reported mental health problems among university students has increased at alarming rates in recent years. While various negative life events (from personal events such as relationship breakdowns to more global events such as COVID-19 [SARS-CoV-2] pandemic) have been found to be important predictors of poor mental health in this population, some individuals have been found robustly to fare better than others in confronting such events. Identifying factors that predict these individuals' mental health, along with the specific coping strategies they utilize may have significant practical implications when confronted by adverse events such as COVID-19. This study investigated relationships between the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 828 (453 females, 374 males, and one ""Other"") Chinese university students' mental health, and their internal strengths, personality characteristics, and demographic profiles. We also investigated whether students' use of specific coping strategies mediated these relationships. Stepwise multiple regression analyses (MRAs) and a path analysis revealed that students who resided in their home country, had higher levels of internal strengths, a lower level of neuroticism and a higher level of agreeableness and reported fewer negative mental health changes than did other respondents during COVID-19 in the second half of 2020. Self-regulation and withdrawal coping strategies were both important mediators of these relationships. These findings have important implications for universities in identifying and assisting students in the face of adverse events such as COVID-19.","Zhao, Chapman, Houghton","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192316103","20221211","adverse life events; coping strategies; higher education; internal strengths; mental health; path analysis; personality traits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42243,""
"Mental Health of Cystic Fibrosis Patients and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland: A Single-Center Comparative Study","Research shows that people with cystic fibrosis are more prone to suffer from psychological problems than healthy people; thus, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland could have had an impact on their mental health. To assess this impact, we examined the mental health of patients before and during the pandemic. Survey participants were asked to fill in questionnaires that consisted of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R; for the purpose of the study, an emotional functioning domain was used) during their hospital visits. A total of 81 patients took part in the study: 39 before the COVID-19 pandemic (BP) and 42 during the COVID-19 pandemic (DP). Patients' medians were lower for the BDI, GHQ-12 and higher for the emotional domain of CFQ-R during the pandemic (3, 6, 75 vs. 4, 10, 73.33). Fewer patients felt that their mental health had deteriorated during the pandemic (&#x394;&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup> = 7.723; <i>p</i> = 0.005), and GHQ-12 scores were lower in the DP group (Z = -3.044; <i>p</i> = 0.002).

"Can Homes Affect Well-Being? A Scoping Review among Housing Conditions, Indoor Environmental Quality, and Mental Health Outcomes","The purpose of the scoping review is to explore the relationship between housing conditions, indoor environmental quality (IEQ), and mental health implications on human well-being. In fact, time spent at home increased due to the recent COVID-19 lockdown period, and social-sanitary emergencies are expected to grow due to the urbanization phenomenon. Thus, the role of the physical environment in which we live, study, and work, has become of crucial importance, as the literature has recently highlighted. This scoping review, conducted on the electronic database Scopus, led to the identification of 366 articles. This, after the screening processes based on the inclusion criteria, led to the final inclusion of 31 papers related specifically to the OECD area. The review allowed the identification of five housing conditions [house type, age, and floor level; housing qualities; household composition; neighborhood; green spaces] that, by influencing the IEQ parameters, had impacts on the mental health outcomes addressed. By synthesizing the contributions of the review, a list of design recommendations has been provided. These will serve as a basis for future researchers, from which to develop measures to reduce inequalities in housing by making them healthier, more resilient, and salutogenic.","Riva, Rebecchi, Capolongo, Gola","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315975","20221211","architectural features; design recommendations; housing conditions; indoor environmental quality; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42245,""
"The Road Less Traveled: How COVID-19 Patients Use Metaphors to Frame Their Lived Experiences","Metaphor provides an important intellectual tool for communication about intense disease experiences. The present study aimed to investigate how COVID-19-infected persons metaphorically frame their lived experiences of COVID-19, and how the pandemic impacts on their mental health burden. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 patients afflicted with COVID-19. Metaphor analysis of patient narratives demonstrated that: (1) COVID-19 infection impacted patient conceptualization of themselves and the relationship between the ""self"" and the body, as well as social relationships. (2) Metaphors relating to physical experience, space and time, and integrative behaviors tended to be used by COVID-19 patients in a negative way, whereas war metaphors, family metaphors, temperature metaphors, and light metaphors were likely to express positive attitudes. (3) Patients preferred to employ conventional metaphors grounded on embodied sensorimotor experiences to conceptualize their extreme emotional experiences. This study has important implications with respect to the therapeutic function of metaphors in clinical communication between healthcare professionals and COVID-19 patients.","Deng, Yang, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315979","20221211","COVID-19 patients; healthcare; mental health; metaphor; narrative discourse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42246,""
"""<i>COVID Is Another Layer of Problematic Things</i>"": Change, Vulnerability, and COVID-19 among University Students","The COVID-19 pandemic not only had detrimental effects on physical health but also had adverse effects on college students' mental health. This paper begins to fill a gap in knowledge related to the contextual factors that impacted college students' mental health during COVID. Using in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of 33 college students at a Midwestern university, during Spring 2021, we highlight the pandemic's role in shaping college students' mental health and their outlook of the future. Thematic analysis revealed student reports of mental health decline during the pandemic attributed to campus closures and social distancing policies implemented by the institution to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Students shared that the pandemic created uncertainties about their future opportunities for education, career fulfillment, and employment. However, the interviews also suggested a general sense of adaptation to the pandemic's impact which was students achieved via a combination of active and passive coping strategies. Expanding institution-based mental health services to include a variety of modalities and off-line toolkits for students can help students cope with mental health challenges, whether in 'normal times' or during national crises. Future research should focus on identifying strategies for promoting mental wellness among college students and exploring post-pandemic mental health wellbeing.","David, Schatz, Myroniuk, Teti","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315947","20221211","COVID-19; academic; college students; experiences; mental health; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42247,""

One important concern is the effect of social isolation on the mental health of undergraduates, such as academic anxiety, smartphone addiction and other social psychological problems. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations among undergraduates' social isolation in this special context, social media use for obtaining information about the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., communicative and non-communicative), academic anxiety, and smartphone addiction. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to June in 2022 and a total of 388 undergraduates were included. The results showed significant positive associations between social isolation and smartphone addiction and academic anxiety.

"Health Services Utilization in China during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from a Large-Scale Online Survey","Timely access to essential health services is a concern as COVID-19 continues. This study aimed to investigate health services utilization during the first wave of the pandemic in China. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a self-administrated questionnaire in March 2020. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for data analysis. A total of 4744 respondents were included, with 52.00% reporting affected services utilization. Clinical testing (68.14%) and drug purchase (49.61%) were the most affected types. Higher education level, being married, chronic disease, frequently visiting a provincial medical institution, spending more time on pandemic-related information, perception of high-risk of infection, perception of large health impact of the pandemic, and anxiety/depression were significant predictors for reporting affected services utilization. For the 431 chronic disease respondents, 62.18% reported interruption, especially for drug purchase (58.58%). Affected health services utilization was reported during the first wave of the pandemic in China, especially for those with higher education level, chronic diseases, and COVID-19 related concerns. Enhancing primary healthcare, use of telehealth, extended prescription, and public communication were countermeasures undertaken by China during the rapid rise period. As COVID-19 progresses, the changing disease characteristics, adapted health system, along with enhanced public awareness/knowledge should be considered for the evolution of health services utilization, and further investigation is needed.","Wei, Yuan, Sun, Zhang, Wang, Fu, Wang, Sun, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315892","20221211","COVID-19; access; chronic disease; health seeking behavior; health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42249,""

"Flourishing or Languishing? Predictors of Positive Mental Health in Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical students were burdened with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The objective of the present study was to investigate predictors of positive mental health among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey from September 2021 to March 2022. We applied the snowball recruitment technique involving medical students from the University of Catania, Italy. We administered, anonymously, a questionnaire about demographic characteristics, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A), and the short form of the Mental Health Continuum (MHC-SF). Participants showed moderate anxiety, depression, and stress levels, and more than half had positive mental health status overall. This finding was inversely related to age, depression severity, cyclothymic, and depressive temperaments. Our results showed that medical students with depressive and cyclothymic temperaments were more at risk of worsening mental health status during the pandemic.

"Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Italian LGBT+ Young Adults' Mental Health: The Role of Neuroticism and Family Climate","Vulnerable populations have been among the most affected by the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic; among those, young people and sexual and gender minorities have seen their situation exacerbated by new specific regulations. The aim of the present study was twofold: first, to assess the role of family climate, concerning participants' LGBT+ status during lockdown restrictions, in mediating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal quality of life and mental health (stress, depression, and anxiety); second, to assess how individual stable traits can moderate the relationship between the individual impact of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes. A total of 407 young adults aged 18 to 35 (M age = 25.03 years; SD = 4.68) who self-identified as being part of a sexual or gender minority took part in this study. Results highlight the association between negative family climate and internalizing symptoms of psychological distress, and its role as a partial mediator of the relationship between the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at the individual level and mental health outcomes.

"A Cross-Sectional Study of the Perceived Stress, Well-Being and Their Relations with Work-Related Behaviours among Hong Kong School Leaders during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The health and well-being of school leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic have been largely neglected compared to the health and well-being of students and teachers. This study assessed the magnitude of perceived stress and well-being and the associated factors, including number of working hours, work-related sense of coherence (work-SoC), perceived stress, self-endangering work behaviour, secondary burnout symptoms, and satisfaction with work, among school leaders in Hong Kong, China during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 259 eligible school leaders in Hong Kong from April 2021 to February 2022. Pearson's correlation analyses, multilinear regression models, and independent-samples Student's t-tests were performed. The findings revealed that school leaders' perceived stress was negatively correlated with their well-being (<i>r</i> = -0.544, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and work-related SoC (<i>r</i> = -0.327, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) but positively correlated with their extensification of work (<i>r</i> = 0.473, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), exhaustion related to work situations (<i>r</i> = 0.559, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01), and psychosomatic complaints (<i>r</i> = 0.439, <i>p &amp;lt; 0</i>.01). In a model that adjusted for gender and age, student leaders with higher subjective well-being scores had a lower level of perceived stress (B = -0.031; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.59, -0.02; <i>p</i> = 0.034), whereas leaders in schools with a larger student population had a higher level of perceived stress (B = 0.002; 95% CI, 0.000, 0.003; <i>p</i> = 0.030). School leaders with a higher likelihood of performing the self-endangering work behaviour of 'intensification of work' had higher perceived stress levels (B = 1.497; 95% CI, 0.717, 2.278; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). School leaders with a higher work-related SoC (B = 4.20; 95% CI, 1.290, 7.106; <i>p</i> = 0.005) had a higher level of well-being. School leaders with higher levels of perceived stress (B = -0.734; 95% CI, -1.423, -0.044; <i>p</i> = 0.037), a higher likelihood of performing the self-endangering work behaviour of 'extensification of work' (B = -4.846; 95% CI, -8.543, -1.149; <i>p</i> = 0.010), and a higher score for exhaustion related to work (B = -10.449; 95% CI, -13.864, -7.033; <i>p</i> = 0.000) showed lower levels of well-being. The finding of a high incidence of stress among school leadership justifies the need for more societal attention to the well-being of school leaders in Hong Kong. It is important that policies and initiatives are designed to enhance the well-being of school leaders and that they are supported in leading the management of schools and coping with stress in school settings.","Lau, Shum, Man, Cheung, Amoah, Leung, Okan, Dadaczynski","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315777","20221211","COVID-19; education; leadership; occupational well-being; school leaders; school management; school principals; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42253,""
"Psychotic Disorders in the Course of SARS-CoV-2 Infection or Uncomplicated Amantadine Treatment?-Case Report","The mental health impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently the subject of intense research. Mental disorders in the course of coronavirus infection are non-specific. They most often have a sudden onset and short-term course and resolve spontaneously or after the administration of low doses of antipsychotic drugs. At the same time, attempts have been made to develop recommendations for COVID-19 therapy. Single reports suggest the effectiveness of amantadine in the treatment. The mechanism of action of the drug in this case is not known; it is expected that amantadine, by reducing the expression of the cathepsin L gene, may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition, this drug stimulates dopaminergic transmission, which may result in numerous side effects, often of a neuropsychological nature, the most common of which are visual hallucinations. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to unequivocally diagnose the cause of mental disorders among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who took amatatide for off-label treatment. A clear assessment of whether the psychological symptoms in this group of patients are the primary or secondary clinical manifestation of the infection or a complication of amantadine treatment is difficult. In this context, we attempted to describe a case of a patient with psychotic symptoms who was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and treated with amantadine.","Tatar, &#x15a;wierzy, B&#x142;achut, Badura Brzoza","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315768","20221211","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; amantadine; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42254,""
"Major Depression in Postpartum Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Can Social Support Buffer Psychosocial Risks and Substance Use?","Rates of mood disorders and substance use increased during the COVID-19 pandemic for postpartum women. The present study's aims were to: (1) examine the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) evaluate whether social support can buffer the associations between MDD, psychosocial factors (perceived stress, generalized anxiety, and intimate partner violence) and substance use (alcohol and drug use). A nationwide survey included 593 postpartum mothers (within 12 months from birth). Participants were assessed for a provisional diagnosis of MDD, and provided responses on validated instruments measuring stress, intimate partner violence, suicidal ideation, generalized anxiety, social support, and substance use. A hierarchical logistic regression model assessed the association of psychosocial factors and substance use with MDD. The final model shows that social support attenuates the association of MDD with perceived stress, alcohol use, and drug use, but does not buffer the relationship of MDD with anxiety or intimate partner violence. Social support was shown to significantly attenuate the effects of stress, alcohol use, and drug use on MDD, suggesting that the presence of a strong, supportive social network should be an area of increased focus for public health and healthcare professionals when caring for postpartum women.","Howard, Leong, Chambless, Grigsby, Cordaro, Perrotte, Howard","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315748","20221211","depression; postpartum; pregnancy; social support; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42255,""
"Breastfeeding and Obstetric Violence during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Spain: Maternal Perceptions","Catalan legislation, a pioneer in Europe, has defined obstetric violence (OV) as ""preventing or hindering access to truthful information, necessary for autonomous and informed decision-making"". The definition also states that OV can affect physical and mental health, as well as sexual and reproductive health. Some authors have expressed concern about an increase in OV during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. During the pandemic, recommendations were also openly offered on the non-establishment and/or early abandonment of breastfeeding without scientific evidence to support them. Experiencing a traumatic childbirth can influence breastfeeding outcomes. Here, we conducted a cross-sectional study using a self-administered online questionnaire. The sample consisted of women who gave birth in Spain between March 2020 and April 2021. The mean age was 34.41 (&#xb1;4.23) years. Of the women, 73% were employed, 78.2% had a university education, and almost all were Caucasian. Among the subjects, 3.3% were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 1% were diagnosed during delivery. Some of the women (1.6%) were advised to stop breastfeeding in order to be vaccinated.

An inductive thematic analysis was performed and international recommendations for the development of qualitative studies were followed. Twenty-four participants residing in nursing homes were included. Two main themes were identified: (1) emotional impact of the experience of COVID-19 lockdown (subthemes: experience of contradictory feelings; illness and death; importance of routine; feeling busy; and role of religious beliefs); and (2) support as a therapeutic tool (subthemes: family support; peer support; and professional support). Social restrictions by COVID-19 caused significant changes in residents' occupations and routines, producing fear, loneliness, and abandonment of desired occupations; however, very important supports were also identified that helped to overcome the lockdown, such as social support, spirituality, and gratitude.","Crespo-Mart&#xed;n, Palacios-Ce&#xf1;a, Huertas-Hoyas, G&#xfc;eita-Rodr&#xed;guez, Fern&#xe1;ndez-G&#xf3;mez, P&#xe9;rez-Corrales","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315712","20221211","COVID-19; nursing homes; occupational therapy; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42257,""
"You Do Not Have to Get through This Alone: Interpersonal Emotion Regulation and Psychosocial Resources during the COVID-19 Pandemic across Four Countries","While experiencing the unpredictable events of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are likely to turn to people in order to regulate our emotions. In this research, we investigate how this interpersonal emotion regulation is connected to affective symptoms, above and beyond <i>intra</i>personal emotion regulation. Furthermore, we explore whether perceived psychosocial resources moderate these associations, i.e., if individuals reporting healthier social connections benefit differently from interpersonal emotion regulation. <i>N</i> = 1401 participants from the USA, UK, Germany, and Switzerland completed an online survey that included text samples. Affective symptoms (depression, adjustment disorder, fear of COVID-19) were examined based on self-reported as well as language-based indicators. As psychosocial resources, we examined social support, loneliness, attachment style, and trust. We defined latent variables for adaptive and maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation and analyzed how they were associated with affective symptoms controlling for intrapersonal emotion regulation. Further, we analyzed how they interacted with psychosocial resources. Maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies were associated with affective symptoms. With lower psychosocial resources, the associations between interpersonal emotion regulation and depressive symptoms were more pronounced. The results highlight that maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation is associated with worse mental health. These effects are not buffered by more psychosocial resources and are stronger for people with low psychosocial resources.","Dworakowski, Huber, Meier, Boyd, Martin, Horn","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315699","20221211","COVID-19; interpersonal emotion regulation; mental health; psychosocial resources","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42258,""
"The Influence of COVID-19 on University Students' Well-Being, Physical Activity, Body Composition, and Strength Endurance","Very few scientific studies have simultaneously evaluated changes in well-being (WB), physical activity (PA), and strength endurance (SE) based on results from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to assess WB, PA, and SE levels, as well as body composition parameters in university students before and during the pandemic. The study included 30 males and 30 females (mean age: 21.7 &#xb1; 2.51 and 21.6 &#xb1; 2.34 years, respectively). Well-being using the Self-Perception Questionnaire (POMS), PA from the Polish regular version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), body composition parameters using the InBody 270 analyzer, and SE based on the results of a 12 min test involving a Concept 2PM-5 rowing ergometer were assessed before and during the pandemic. An assessment of university students' WB revealed a significant increase in variables such as tension, depression, anger, confusion, and a significant decline in vigor (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). In both sexes, PA and SE decreased significantly-from 2115.4 to 1822.8 METs-min/week and from 2184.5 to 2035 m, respectively, in males, and from 1793.5 to 1699.8 METs-min/week and from 2021.5 to 1943.8 m, respectively, in females. At the same time, body mass and BMI values increased significantly (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) in both females and males.

"Sleep Problems and New Occurrence of Chronic Conditions during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted upon sleep health. Relatively little is known about how this may influence the population's health subsequently. This prospective longitudinal study aims to examine the consequences of sleep problems for physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, using data from the Understanding Society: COVID-19 Study, a large-scale population-based survey with 12,804 adults aged 16 and above. A measure of sleep problems was derived from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questions, reflecting seven dimensions of sleep quality. Binary logistic regressions were applied to investigate the relationship between sleep problem and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, obesity, arthritis and an emotional, nervous or psychiatric problem over the 15 months follow-up period. The analysis confirms that sleep problems are prevalent and vary between sub-groups among adults. Notably, sleep problems are then significantly associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, arthritis and emotional, nervous or psychiatric problems, independent of demographic, socioeconomic, familial and health confounders. Our findings suggest promoting good sleep hygiene should be prioritised during the pandemic, and more generally as part of wider programmes aimed at promoting good physical and mental health.","Falkingham, Evandrou, Vlachantoni, Qin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315664","20221211","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; physical health; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42260,""
"Factors Associated with Depression and Anxiety Symptoms among Migrant Population in Spain during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Migrants are likely to experience mental health conditions, being one of the most vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms and (2) examine the impact of risk and protective factors on this symptomatology. A sample of 129 migrants living in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic completed an anonymous online survey, including information on sociodemographic and individual characteristics, migration, basic needs, social environment and perceived health domains. Multiple Poisson regression models analysed the effects of risk and protective factors on depression and anxiety symptoms. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 22.3% and 21.4%, respectively. Risk factors such as living in a rented house and previous mental health conditions were associated with higher depression symptoms, whereas unemployment was related to anxiety symptoms. Conversely, older age, better self-esteem, and higher levels of social support were associated with fewer depression symptoms. Older age and better quality of life were related to fewer anxiety symptoms. These findings addressing risk and protective factors (e.g., social support, self-esteem) help to design culturally effective programs, particularly in migrants with pre-existing mental health conditions, adjusting the organisation of mental healthcare services in difficult times in Spain.","Bayes-Marin, Roura-Adserias, Gin&#xe9;-V&#xe1;zquez, Villalobos, Franch-Roca, Lloret-Pineda, Gabarrell-Pascuet, He, Hafi, Butt, Mellor-Mars&#xe1;, Al&#xf3;s, Sainz-El&#xed;as, Ayad-Ahmed, Aparicio, Cabeza, Bobo, L&#xf3;pez, Haro, Crist&#xf3;bal-Narv&#xe1;ez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315646","20221211","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; migration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42261,""
"Support over Social Media among Socially Isolated Sexual and Gender Minority Youth in Rural US during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Opportunities for Intervention Research","Sexual and gender minority (SGM) rural adolescents are at risk for higher levels of social isolation, a well-known risk factor for depression and other negative health outcomes. We qualitatively examined how rural SGM youth seek emotional and informational support, which are protective factors for social isolation on social media (SM) regarding their SGM identity, and determined which SM platforms and tools are most effective in providing support. We conducted semistructured online interviews with rural SGM teens who screened positive for social isolation in spring 2020 and used a thematic analysis approach to analyze the data. Sixteen youths participated in interviews. Themes included seeking emotional support through SM groups and communities, seeking emotional support in designated online SGM spaces, using SM feeds for informational support, and disclosing SGM identity differentially across platforms. SM-based interventions could be leveraged to provide emotional and informational support for rural SGM youth across specific SM platforms and consider whether they are providing emotional or information support. Interventions focused on informational support may best be used on content-based platforms. Those designed to combat social isolation and connect marginalized SGM youths to similar others might benefit from community and forum-based platforms.","Karim, Choukas-Bradley, Radovic, Roberts, Maheux, Escobar-Viera","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315611","20221211","LGBT youth; rural youth; social isolation; social media; social media interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42262,""

The key role played by attachment and alexithymia has also been suggested, but no study has explored the possible dynamic relationship between these variables. We recruited a sample of <i>n</i> = 410 young adult university students online. We assessed the attachment to parents and peers (through IPPA), alexithymia (through TAS-20), peritraumatic distress symptoms due to COVID-19 (through CPDI), and IA (through IAT). The results showed that the relationship between the attachment to mothers and IA was partially mediated by alexithymia and by the serial mediation of alexithymia and peritraumatic distress, whereas the influence of the attachment to fathers on IA was fully mediated by peritraumatic distress. The direct effects of the attachment to peers on alexithymia, peritraumatic distress, and IA were all significant, as were the indirect paths via the simple mediation of both alexithymia and peritraumatic distress and the multiple serial mediation of alexithymia and peritraumatic distress.

"Prevalence and Predictors of Somatization in Peruvian Undergraduate Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on mental health. Multiple studies report the alarming prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress-related conditions due to the lockdown measures. Nevertheless, somatization has been an overlooked topic in current literature despite its strong relationship with most mental health conditions. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of somatic symptoms and their associated factors in a sample of 3218 undergraduate students from Lima, Peru. A cross-sectional design was carried out. The prevalence of somatic symptoms was measured with the PHQ-15. As predictors of somatic symptom severity, we included psychopathological (depression, anxiety, and stress), psychological (perceived social support, resilience, satisfaction with life, and academic self-efficacy), and sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex, employment status, relationship status, daily hours of sleep) variables. A generalized linear model from a binomial family and a logit link function were applied based on a Factor Score Regression approach, with half of the sample presenting moderate-to-severe somatic symptoms. Anxiety was the strongest predictor of somatic symptom severity, followed by academic self-efficacy. Significant differences were found regarding sex, relationship status, daily hours of sleep and COVID-19 risk-related variables. In conclusion, interventions on reducing anxiety and promoting academic self-efficacy may have a stronger impact on somatic symptom severity and should focus on more vulnerable specific demographic groups such as females.","Zegarra-L&#xf3;pez, Luna-Victoria, Romero-Montenegro, Florentino-Santisteban, Prieto-Molinari, Montoya-Cuadrao","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315576","20221211","COVID-19; Peru; anxiety; depression; mental health; resilience; self-efficacy; somatization; stress; undergraduate students; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42264,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Female Sexual Function Index and Female Behavioral Changes: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study in Thailand","Sexual health alterations are associated with disasters. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may affect female sexual function. This study aimed to determine the COVID-19 pandemic effect on female sexual function and to know the risk of female sexual dysfunction. This online, cross-sectional, observational research was conducted during the pandemic period. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the associations between outcomes and potential risk factors. In total, 432 sexually active women participating in the region affected by the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. The overall findings of our study are that 60 percent of females were at risk for female sexual dysfunction. The average FSFI score was 21.27 &#xb1; 7.17.

This study used a theater-based workshop to describe manifestations, representations, and potential causes of depression and anxiety as perceived by adolescents and young adults. The theater company <i>Teatro La Plaza</i> conducted three online sessions with a group of adolescents and another with a group of young adults from Lima, Peru. The artistic outputs, which included images, similes, monologues, and narrations, were used to describe the experiences of depression and anxiety symptoms following a content analysis using posteriori categories. Seventeen participants joined the sessions. The artistic outputs showed: physical, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional manifestations of depression and anxiety; a perception that both disorders have a cyclical nature; and an awareness that it is often difficult to notice symptom triggers. The mandatory social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic was highlighted as an important symptom trigger, mostly linked to anxiety. The findings are consistent with the literature, especially with regard to the manifestations, representations, and potential causes that trigger depression and anxiety.

"Association between the Health Belief Model, Exercise, and Nutrition Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our nation's health further than the infection it causes. Physical activity levels and dietary intake have suffered while individuals grapple with the changes in behavior to reduce viral transmission. With unique nuances regarding the access to physical activity and nutrition during the pandemic, the constructs of Health Belief Model (HBM) may present themselves differently in nutrition and exercise behaviors compared to precautions implemented to reduce viral transmission studied in previous research. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of exercise and nutritional behavior change during the COVID-19 pandemic and explain the reason for and extent of this change using HBM constructs (perceived susceptibility, severity, benefit of action, and barriers to action). This study used a cross-sectional design to collect 206 surveys. This survey collected information on self-reported exercise and nutrition changes during the pandemic and self-reported levels of the HBM constructs. Findings showed individuals with medium or high exercise behavior change had greater odds of increased HBM score than individuals with little to no exercise behavior change (OR = 1.117, 95% CI: 1.020-1.223, SE: 0.0464, <i>p</i> = 0.0175). There was no association between nutritional behavior change and HBM score (OR = 1.011, 95% CI: 0.895-1.142, <i>p</i> = 08646). Individuals who reported a more drastic change in either exercise had greater odds of increased feelings of perceived susceptibility and severity related to COVID-19 and decreased perceived benefits and increased barriers to exercise. This relationship was not found regarding nutrition behavior change. These results encourage public health practitioners to understand how an individual's perceived feelings about a threat may affect exercise and nutritional behaviors.","Kiely, Mase, Hansen, Schwind","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315516","20221211","COVID-19; Health Belief Model; epidemiology; exercise; nutrition; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42269,""
"Hierarchical Analysis of Forms of Support for Employees in the Field of Health Protection and Quality of Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Desired Post-Pandemic Forms of Support","Issues of employee support during the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic period are of an interdisciplinary nature. Moreover, these should be considered from both an epistemological and a practical perspective. The aim of this study was to determine what forms of support for employees in terms of health and quality of work were provided by employers during the pandemic and what forms of support will be expected by employees after it ceases. The research process was carried out in two stages: primary and secondary exploration and quantitative clarification. In the first stage, a systematic review of the literature and a critical analysis of the so-called grey literature was performed. In the second stage, computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) methodology was used. Ward's method was used for data analysis. The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic forced employers to search for new solutions to enable the continuation of their business activities, which consisted of switching from the traditional form of work to a remote form. The transition to the remote work mode changed the approach to the forms of work support provided for employees, with particular emphasis on the health of employees and the quality of work. The changes in the forms of support for employees in terms of health and quality of work were either bottom-up or top-down. Employers tried to provide access to remote infrastructure as much as possible, but the consequences of remote work in terms of the physical and mental health of employees were rarely noticed or considered. After the pandemic, online health support and access to the appropriate equipment and tools for remote work are unlikely to be needed.","Dembi&#x144;ska, Barczak, Rostkowski, Kauf, Marska-Dzioba","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315509","20221211","COVID-19; Ward&#x2019;s method; clustering method; employee; health; hierarchical method; post-pandemic; quality of work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42270,""

Fatigue and brain fog affected all domains and identified subthemes included symptoms' synergistic effects, difficulty with multitasking, lack of support, poor self-perception, and fear of loss of income and employment. Personal relationships were affected with change of responsibilities, difficulty parenting, social isolation, and guilt due to the burdens placed on family.

"The Relationship between Physical Activity, Sleep Quality, and Stress: A Study of Teachers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted chaotic changes in the daily lives of K-12 teachers, resulting in increased stress and other mental health problems. Limited evidence regarding the relationship between physical activity, sleep, and perceived stress among teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic exists. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between physical activity, sleep quality, and perceived psychological stress among teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey measuring physical activity, sleep quality, and perceived psychological stress was distributed across 47 US states between September and October of 2020. Data provided by 635 teachers (mean age: 42 &#xb1; 18 years, 74.6% female) were included in the present analysis. Results suggested a negative association between physical activity and perceived psychological stress. Mediation analyses indicated that teachers engaging in high levels of physical activity were more likely to have good quality sleep and, in turn, were less likely to report high levels of perceived stress. Physical activity and sleep-related interventions could help curtail the rising levels of psychological distress amongst K-12 teachers during stressful times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers, especially those that self-report as female and/or young, report high levels of stress. These high levels of stress are a serious challenge for school districts in terms of attracting and retaining qualified teachers in K-12 classrooms.","Fontana, Bourbeau, Moriarty, da Silva","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315465","20221211","COVID-19; mediating effect; physical activity; sleep; stress; teacher","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42272,""

"Factors Influencing Use of Fitness Apps by Adults under Influence of COVID-19","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries imposed restrictions and quarantines on the population, which led to a decrease in people's physical activity (PA) and severely damaged their mental health. As a result, people engaged in fitness activities with the help of fitness apps, which improved their resistance to the virus and reduced the occurrence of psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. However, the churn rate of fitness apps is high. As such, our purpose in this study was to analyze the factors that influence the use of fitness apps by adults aged 18-65 years in the context of COVID-19, with the aim of contributing to the analysis of mobile fitness user behavior and related product design practices. We constructed a decision target program model using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and we analyzed and inductively screened 11 evaluation indicators, which we combined with an indicator design questionnaire. We distributed 420 questionnaires; of the respondents, 347 knew about or used fitness apps. Among these 347, we recovered 310 valid questionnaires after removing invalid questionnaires with a short completion time, for an effective questionnaire recovery rate of 89.33%. We used the AHP and entropy method to calculate and evaluate the weight coefficient of each influencing factor and to determine an influencing factor index. Our conclusions were as follows: first, the effect of perceived usefulness on the use of fitness apps by the study groups was the most notable. Second, personal motivation and perceived ease of use considerably influenced the adult group's willingness to use fitness apps. Finally, the perceived cost had relatively little effect on the use of fitness apps by adults, and the study group was much more concerned with the privacy cost than the expense cost.","Guo, Ma, Chen, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192315460","20221211","COVID-19; adult group; fitness APP; influencing factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42274,""
"Social Support and Mental Health in the Postpartum Period in Times of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Spanish Multicentre Cohort Study","To explore the depression and anxiety symptoms in the postpartum period during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to identify potential risk factors. A multicentre observational cohort study including 536 women was performed at three hospitals in Spain. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Scale, the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS), and the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) were assessed after birth. Depression (EPDS) and anxiety (STAI) symptoms were measured, and the cut-off scores were set at 10 and 13 for EPDS, and at 40 for STAI. Regarding EPDS, 32.3% (95% CI, 28% to 36.5%) of women had a score &#x2265; 10, and 17.3% (95% CI, 13.9% to 20.7%) had a score &#x2265; 13. Women with an STAI score &#x2265; 40 accounted for 46.8% (95% CI, 42.3% to 51.2%). A lower level of social support (MOS-SSS), a fetal malformation diagnosis and a history of depression (<i>p</i> = 0.000, <i>p</i> = 0.019 and <i>p</i> = 0.043) were independent risk factors for postpartum depression. A lower level of social support and a history of mental health disorders (<i>p</i> = 0.000, <i>p</i> = 0.003) were independent risk factors for postpartum anxiety.

"The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mental health care use among Norwegian students in higher education: a nation-wide register-based pre-post cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic, and its associated social distancing measures, gave profound changes to the everyday and academic life of students in higher education. The current study is the first to use nation-wide data to evaluate the long-term effect of the pandemic and its countermeasures on university students' mental health care use. Using nation-wide individual-level data, we studied mental health consultations in primary care (data available from January 2017 to February 2022) and dispensed prescription drugs used to treat anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances (data available from October 2018 to February 2021) for first-year undergraduate university students. We compared changes over time in mental health care use in a pandemic cohort (12,501 first-year students enrolled in 2019) to the same change in a pre-pandemic cohort (25,990 first-year students enrolled in 2017 and 2018). Event study and difference-in-difference models allowed us to separate the impact of the pandemic, experienced by the pandemic cohort only, from secular and seasonal changes experienced by all cohorts. The percentage of students with a mental health consultation temporarily decreased during the first period of strict social distancing measures in March 2020. At the end of the second round with strict measures in April 2021, the level of mental health consultations increased by 73% (95% CI 40-106.3). There was also a 42% (95% CI 5.7-79.5) increase in mental health consultations in November 2021. No similar increases were observed for dispensed prescription drugs between March 2020 and February 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in mental health consultations in primary care among students, especially during/after longer periods of strict social distancing measures. The benefits of social distancing measures in future pandemic preparedness should be weighed against the cost of potentially worsening mental health in vulnerable groups.","Gr&#xf8;sland, Larsen, Reneflot, Hart","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08816-3","20221210","COVID-19; Mental health; Prescription drugs; Primary health care; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42276,""
"Adaptor protein MyD88 confers the susceptibility to stress via amplifying immune danger signals","Increasing evidence supports the pathogenic role of neuroinflammation in psychiatric diseases, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the precise mechanism and therapeutic strategy are poorly understood. Here, we report that myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), a pivotal adaptor that bridges toll-like receptors to their downstream signaling by recruiting the signaling complex called 'myddosome', was up-regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) after exposure to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The inducible expression of MyD88 in the mPFC primed neuroinflammation and conferred stress susceptibility via amplifying immune danger signals, such as high-mobility group box 1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Overexpression of MyD88 aggravated, whereas knockout or pharmacological inhibition of MyD88 ameliorated CSDS-induced depressive-like behavior. Notably, TJ-M2010-5, a novel synthesized targeting inhibitor of MyD88 dimerization, alleviated both CSDS- and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced depressive-like behavior. Taken together, our findings indicate that inhibiting MyD88 signaling represents a promising therapeutic strategy for stress-related mental disorders, such as MDD and COVID-19-related neuropsychiatric symptoms.","Yao, Ye, Feng, Jiang, Zhou, Wang, Chen, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2022.12.007","20221210","Coronavirus disease 2019; Depression; MyD88; Proinflammatory; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42277,""
"Assessing the impact of telehealth implementation on postpartum outcomes for Black birthing people","The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid uptake of telemedicine services, which have been shown to be potentially cost-saving and of comparable quality to in-person care for certain populations. However, there are some concerns regarding feasibility of implementation for marginalized populations and the impact of widespread implementation of these services on health disparities has not been well studied. To assess the impact of implementation of telehealth for postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic on racial disparities in visit attendance and completion of postpartum care goals. In this retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary care center, we compared differences in outcomes between all Black and non-Black patients who had scheduled postpartum visits (PPV) prior to and following implementation of telehealth for postpartum care. Our primary outcome was PPV attendance. Secondary outcomes included postpartum depression screening, contraception selection, breastfeeding status, completion of postpartum 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) and cardiology follow-up for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In multivariable analysis, interaction terms evaluated the differential impact of telehealth implementation by race. Of the 1,579 patients meeting inclusion criteria (pre-implementation: 780, post-implementation: 799), 63% self-identified as Black. In the pre-implementation period, Black patients were less likely to attend a postpartum visit than non-Black patients (Black: 63.9% vs non-Black: 88.7%, aOR= 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.79). In the post-implementation period, there was no difference in postpartum visit attendance by race (Black: 79.1% vs non-Black: 88.6%, aOR= 0.74, 95% CI: 0.45-1.21). Significant differences across race in postpartum depression screening during the pre-implementation period also became non-significant in the post-implementation period. Implementation of telehealth for postpartum care significantly reduced racial disparities in postpartum visit attendance (interaction p=0.005). Implementation of telehealth for postpartum care during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with decreased racial disparities in postpartum visit attendance.","Kumar, Arias, Leitner, Wang, Clement, Hamm","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2022.100831","20221210","COVID-19 pandemic; Implementation science; Postpartum care; Racial disparities; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42278,""

"Increases in stress hormone levels in a UK population during the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective cohort study","Research suggests that psychological factors may influence vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the mechanisms are unclear. We examined whether the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may be a possible mechanism, by measuring the relationship between indices of psychological distress and cortisone in hair (hairE) in a UK cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;827) provided two 3&#xa0;cm hair samples over a 6-month period between April-September 2020. Samples reflected hairE in the 3 months prior to the collection date. HairE in the first samples (T1: commenced April 2020) did not differ significantly from pre-pandemic population norms. However, hairE in the second samples (T2: commenced July 2020) were significantly higher than T1 and pre-pandemic population norms, with a 23% increase between T1 and T2. Linear regressions, controlling for age and gender, demonstrated that at both timepoints, hairE levels were greatest in people with a history of mental health difficulties. In addition, stress reported at T1 predicted greater hairE at T2 and a greater change in hairE between T1 and T2. These findings demonstrate that during the COVID-19 pandemic hairE was substantially elevated across a large community cohort, with greatest levels in those with a history of mental health difficulties and greatest changes in those reporting greatest levels of stress early in the pandemic. Further research is required with verified SARS-CoV-2 outcomes to determine whether the HPA axis is among the mechanisms by which a history of mental health difficulties and stress influence SARS-CoV-2 outcomes.","Jia, Ayling, Coupland, Chalder, Massey, Nater, Broadbent, Gasteiger, Gao, Kirschbaum, Vedhara","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.105992","20221210","COVID-19; Hair cortisol; Hair cortisone; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42280,""

"Frailty and Mental Health Disorders Before and During COVID-19 Occurrence in Older Population in Iran: A Longitudinal Repeated-Measures Study","Iranians' worry over the number of older patients negatively impacted by COVID-19 surged dramatically throughout the 5 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted from January 2020 to September 2021. The goal of this research was to assess the physical and mental health of Iranian older persons throughout the COVID-19 pandemic's major waves. The health condition of 507 older persons with a positive examination for COVID-19 illness was assessed before and throughout the 5 waves of coronavirus in south Iran in analytical and hybrid longitudinal research. The primary consequences of COVID-19 incidence on frailty and mental health issues were revealed in this investigation. Using a linear mixed model, we found a reduction of 0.33 in loneliness (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.33, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.26) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, the influence of COVID-19 incidence on loneliness result differs by gender; for depression, it varies by education; and for anxiety, it changes by comorbidities and living independently.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates in Hungary: an interrupted time-series analysis","From 2010 to 2019, suicide mortality fell steadily and substantially in Hungary: the declining trend remained stable, and the suicide rate decreased by more than one-third which was remarkable even from an international perspective. However, despite the declining trend, regional inequalities have always characterised the distribution of suicide mortality in Hungary. Following these favourable trends, COVID-19 appeared in Hungary on the 4<sup>th</sup> of March 2020 which might lead to an increase in suicides. We aimed to investigate this hypothesis in Hungary by gender, age, educational attainment, and region, as well. To test whether the pandemic changed the declining trend of Hungarian suicide rates, the observed number of suicides during March-December 2020 (pre-vaccination period) was compared with the expected numbers (without the appearance of COVID-19). An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted by negative binomial regression using monthly data from January 2010 to February 2020 (pre-pandemic period). Suicide mortality increased significantly compared to the trend during the pre-pandemic period: overall (by 16.7%), among males (18.5%), in the age group 35-49&#xa0;years (32.8%), and among vocational school graduates (26.1%). Additionally, significant growths in suicide rates were detected in the two regions (Central Hungary and Central Transdanubia) with the lowest COVID mortality rates (by 27.3% and 22.2%, respectively). Our study revealed reversed trend in suicide mortality during the pre-vaccination period compared to the pre-pandemic period in Hungary. There were significant differences in the pattern of suicide rates by gender, age group, educational attainment, and region during the pre-vaccination period in Hungary, which might be attributed to the socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings could prove useful in preventive strategies as the identification of groups at higher risk may be important for suicide prevention; however, further investigations are needed to explore the reasons.","Lantos, Ny&#xe1;ri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04322-2","20221210","Age group; COVID-19; Educational attainment; Gender; Hungary; Interrupted time-series; Region; Regression; Suicide; Trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42283,""

"Variations in the uptake of telemental&#xa0;health technologies in community and crisis mental health services during the early pandemic: a survey of mental health professionals in the UK","One of the many challenges faced by mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic was how to deliver care during lockdown. In community and crisis services, this often meant rapidly adopting or expanding the use of telemental health technologies, including phone and video calls. The aim of this study is to explore variations in use and report staff views of such technologies during the early stages of the pandemic. The primary analysis compared rates of use between professions, demographic groups, genders, regions, and crisis and community services. We used data from an online survey conducted by the Mental Health Policy Research Unit in Spring 2020 regarding the impact of the pandemic on mental healthcare in the United Kingdom. We included quantitative data from all professional groups working in community or crisis services providing care to working age adults, including general and specialist services. Our outcome of interest was the percentage of clients whom clinicians primarily interacted with via videocall. We also collected demographics and professional characteristics such as the type of mental health service respondents worked in. In addition, we explored respondents' views and experiences of telemental health as a medium for providing care. 978 participants were included in the primary analysis (834 provided outcome data for community services, 193 for crisis services). In community services, virtually all staff reported stopping some or all face-to-face appointments following the onset of the pandemic, with a large majority using video or phone call appointments where possible instead. Telemental health use was higher in community than in crisis services, and amongst professionals who mainly provided psychotherapy or peer support than in other groups. There was also evidence of use being lower in regions in Northern England, Scotland, and Wales than elsewhere. There was no evidence of an association with staff gender, age, or ethnicity. Staff were generally positive about telemental health and intended to make more use of technologies following the pandemic. However, significant barriers to its use were also reported, often involving skills and available infrastructure. Despite its rapid implementation, telemental health was viewed positively by clinicians who saw it as an effective alternative to face-to-face appointments in some contexts, including during the pandemic. However, adoption of the technology also has the potential to exacerbate existing or create new inequalities without effective management of training and infrastructure needs.","Rains, Dalton-Locke, Landau, Needle, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04385-1","20221209","Community Mental Health Services; Covid-19; Lockdown; Pandemic; Telehealth; Telemental health; Videoconferencing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42285,""
"Impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on level of physical activity and health in home-dwelling older adults in Norway","The spread of the coronavirus in spring 2020 led to a lockdown of physical activity (PA) offers. The aim of this study was to investigate how PA, as well as general and mental health, in community-dwelling older adults were affected by the COVID-19 restrictions in Norway. Invitation to participate in the study was sent via Facebook and the Norwegian Pensioners' Association. Inclusion criteria were being&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;65&#xa0;years old and living at home. Participants completed a questionnaire either digitally or on paper in June-August 2020. The questionnaire included questions on PA, general health, and mental health both before (13th of March) and during lockdown. We included 565 participants (mean age 74&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.3&#xa0;years, 60.4% female); almost 60% had a university degree, 84% reported performing PA more than once per week, and 20% reported a fall in the previous 12&#xa0;months. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that the corona lockdown significantly reduced activity level (Z&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.918,&#xa0;p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), general health (Z&#x2009;=&#x2009;-6,910, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and mental health (Z&#x2009;=&#x2009;-12.114, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Those who were less active during lockdown had higher odds of experiencing worse health than those who maintained their activity level, odds ratio: 9.36 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.71-18.58, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) for general health and 2.41 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.52-3.83, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) for mental health. Those who attended organized exercise offers before lockdown had higher odds of being less active during lockdown compared to those who did not exercise in an organized setting, odds ratio: 3.21 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.17-5.76, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In a relatively highly educated and active group of older participants, COVID-19 restrictions still negatively affected level of activity as well as general and mental health. These short-term decreases in activity level and health suggest that preventive actions and increased focus on measures to support older adults in maintaining an active lifestyle are needed.","Nyg&#xe5;rd, Taraldsen, Granbo, Selb&#xe6;k, Helbostad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s11556-022-00309-w","20221209","COVID-19; Health; Older adults; Physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42286,""
"Reduced heart rate variability and expressive suppression interact to prospectively predict COVID-19 pandemic-related post-traumatic stress symptoms","The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress that, in some cases, led to post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs). Emotion regulation strategies are known to modulate the emotional response to stressful events. Expressive suppression (ES) is a maladaptive strategy related to the exacerbation of the physiological stress response. Heart rate variability (HRV), an index of cardiac autonomic balance strictly related to ES, was also shown to predict PTSSs. This was the first study to investigate whether the pre-pandemic ES use and resting-state HRV predicted pandemic-related PTSSs. Before the pandemic, 83 (58 females) university students completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), self-report measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and a three-minute resting-state electrocardiogram recording. After 12&#xa0;months, 61 (45 females) participants completed a self-report measure of pandemic-related PTSSs and repeated the self-report psychological measures. Pre-pandemic anxiety symptoms prospectively predicted greater PTSSs. Moreover, a significant interaction between HRV and ES in predicting PTSSs emerged, whereby those who had higher levels of ES and reduced HRV showed higher PTSSs. These findings suggest that an integrated assessment of HRV and ES might be useful for identifying individuals who are more vulnerable to the development of PTSSs during crises.","Dell'Acqua, Mura, Messerotti Benvenuti, Patron, Palomba","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-25915-7","20221209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42287,""
"Use of Telemedicine Among People with Multiple Sclerosis Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Introduction</i></b>: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common progressive neurological condition with onset in young adulthood. Because people with MS (PwMS) are often separated from specialty care by distance or disability, telemedicine can help alleviate that burden by removing obstacles to accessing care. <b><i>Methods</i></b>: We surveyed 762 PwMS in the iConquerMS research network about their use of in-person and telemedicine services prepandemic (January-February 2020) and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (September-November 2020). The survey asked PwMS about their use of in-person and telemedicine services, technology access, perceptions and preferences of telemedicine, their most recent telemedicine encounter, and reasons for not using telemedicine. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Prepandemic, the most cited reason for not using telemedicine was providers not offering remote visits. During the pandemic, there was a decrease in the use of in-person health care (100% to &#x223c;78%) and an increase in telemedicine utilization (25% to &#x223c;80%). Most participants had access to telemedicine-enabling technologies and a large portion indicated a preference for using telemedicine for some or most/all of their MS health care (41-57%). Before the pandemic, telemedicine utilization was highest for primary care, while during the pandemic, utilization of telemedicine was greatest for general MS care. Mental health telemedicine encounters increased during the pandemic. <b><i>Discussion</i></b>: The dramatic increase in telemedicine utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic has provided access for PwMS to multispecialty care. Maintaining the policy changes that enabled remote health care to expand during the pandemic will be critical for sustained access to MS specialty care for this vulnerable population.","Sumner, Schmidt, Minden, Falkenberg, Sun, McBurney, Loud, Wallin","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2022.0284","20221209","COVID-19 pandemic; multiple sclerosis; neurology; survey; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42288,""
"Depression, anxiety, and burnout among hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Healthcare personnel have faced unprecedented mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study objective is to assess differences in depression, anxiety, and burnout among healthcare personnel with various occupational roles and whether financial and job strain were associated with these mental health outcomes. We employed an anonymous survey between July and August 2020 at an urban county hospital in California, USA. We assessed depression, anxiety, and burnout using validated scales, and asked questions on financial strain and job strain. We performed logistic and linear regression analyses. Nurses (aOR 1.93, 95% CIs 1.12, 3.46), social workers (aOR 2.61, 95% CIs 1.35, 5.17), service workers (aOR 2.55, 95% CIs 1.20, 5.48), and administrative workers (aOR 2.93, 95% CIs 1.57, 5.61) were more likely than physicians to screen positive for depression. The odds of screening positive for anxiety were significantly lower for ancillary workers (aOR 0.32, 95% CIs 0.13-0.72) compared with physicians. Ancillary (aB = -1.77, 95% CIs -1.88, -0.47) and laboratory and pharmacy workers (aB -0.70, 95% CI -1.34, -0.06) reported lower levels of burnout compared with physicians. Financial strain partially accounted for differences in mental health outcomes across job categories. Lack of time to complete tasks and lack of supervisory support were associated with higher odds of screening positive for depression. Less job autonomy was associated with higher odds of screening positive for anxiety and higher burnout levels. We found significant disparities in mental health outcomes across occupational roles. Policies to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on health workers' mental health should include non-clinical staff and address financial support and job characteristics for all occupational roles.","Pala, Chuang, Chien, Krauth, Leitner, Okoye, Costello, Rodriguez, Sheira, Solomon, Weiser","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276861","20221209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42289,""
"Relationship between sociodemographics, loss of income, and mental health among two-spirit, gay, bisexual, and queer men in Manitoba during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined the relationship between loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic and worsening mental health among a sample of 366 Two-Spirit, gay, bisexual, queer (2SGBQ+) men in Manitoba. Data were drawn from a cross-sectional online survey among 2SGBQ+ men in Manitoba. Logistic regression assessed the relationship between sociodemographics, loss of income due to COVID-19 (independent variable) and worsening of mental health (analytic outcome). Among all respondents in the sample (N = 366), 55% indicated worsening of their mental health. In logistic regression, compared to participants who did not experience any loss of income, those who experienced loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to report worsening mental health (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 8.32, 95% Confidence Interval[CI] = 3.54-19.54). Compared to participants who self-identified as gay, bisexual-identifying participants were less likely to report worsening mental health (AOR = .35, 95%CI = 0.13-0.96). Finally, as compared to participants who were married or partnered, participants who were dating (AOR = 3.14, 95%CI = 1.60-6.17), single (AOR = 4.08, 95%CI = 1.75-9.52), and separated/divorced/widowed (AOR = 15.08, 95%CI = 2.22-102.51) were all significantly more likely to report experiencing a worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the need to develop robust public strategies for sub-populations of 2SGBQ+ men (non-gay identified sexual minorities and 2SGBQ+ men who may be more socially isolated). Specific targeted and tailored public health interventions designed with the unique needs of 2SGBQ+ men in Manitoba may be required to increase their access to socio-economic and mental health supports.","Souleymanov, Amjad, Moore, Star, McLeod, Payne, Ringaert, Larcombe, Restall","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278382","20221209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42290,""
"An Emotional Bias Modification for Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Co-design Study","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the common neurodevelopment disorders. Children with ADHD typically have difficulties with emotional regulation. Previous studies have investigated the assessment for underlying emotional biases using the visual probe task. However, one of the significant limitations of the visual probe task is that it is demanding and repetitive over time. Previous studies have examined the use of gamification methods in addressing the limitations of the emotional bias visual probe task. There has also been increased recognition of the potential of participatory action research methods and how it could help to make the conceptualized interventions more relevant. The primary aim of this study was to collate health care professionals' perspectives on the limitations of the existing visual probe task and to determine if gamification elements were viable to be incorporated into an emotional bias modification task. A co-design workshop was conducted. Health care professionals from the Department of Development Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, were invited to participate. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions, a web-based workshop was conducted. There were 3 main phases in the workshops. First, participants were asked to identify limitations and suggest potential methods to overcome some of the identified limitations. Second, participants were shown examples of existing gaming interventions in published literature and commercial stores. They were also asked to comment on the advantages and limitations of these interventions. Finally, participants were asked if gamification techniques would be appropriate. Overall, 4 health care professionals consented and participated. Several limitations were identified regarding the conventional emotional bias intervention. These included the nature of the task parameters, included stimulus set, and factors that could have an impact on the accuracy of responding to the task. After examining the existing ADHD games, participants raised concerns about the evidence base of some of the apps. They articulated that any developed ADHD game ought to identify the specific skill set that was targeted clearly. Regarding gamification strategies, participants preferred economic and performance-based gamification approaches. This study has managed to elucidate health care professionals' perspectives toward refining a conventional emotional bias intervention for children with ADHD. In view of the repetitiveness of the conventional task, the suggested gamification techniques might help in influencing task adherence and reduce the attrition rates.","Zhang, Ranganath","https://doi.org/10.2196/36390","20221209","ADHD; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; child psychiatry; cognitive biases; emotional bias","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42291,""
"Daily COVID-19 Stressor Effects on Children's Mental Health Depend on Pre-pandemic Peer Victimization and Resting Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia","Children's risk of poorer mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on risk and protective factors heading into the pandemic. This study examined same-day associations between COVID-19 stressors and children's mental health using a daily diary design across 14&#xa0;days, and considered the moderating roles of pre-pandemic peer victimization experiences and resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; an indicator of cardiac regulatory capacity). Forty-nine Canadian children aged 8-13&#xa0;years (M<sub>age</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.69, 29 girls) participated in the final wave of a longitudinal study just prior to the pandemic and a daily diary extension during the pandemic (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;686 pandemic measurement occasions). Multilevel modeling indicated that children had poorer mental health on days when they experienced a COVID-19 stressor (e.g., virtual academic difficulties, social isolation). A three-way interaction indicated that this association was stronger for those with higher pre-pandemic peer victimization experiences and lower pre-pandemic resting RSA; however, highly victimized children with higher resting RSA did not experience poorer mental health on days with COVID-19 stressors. Findings offer preliminary insights into the preceding risk and protective factors for children's mental health amidst major subsequent stress.","Wong, Colasante, Malti","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-022-01476-8","20221209","COVID-19; Childhood; Mental health; Peer victimization; Respiratory sinus arrhythmia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42292,""
"Neurological Complications of COVID-19","COVID-19 has caused several pandemic peaks worldwide due to its high variability and infectiousness, and COVID-19 has become a long-standing global public health problem. There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes multi-organ injuries and more severe neurological manifestations. Therefore, increased awareness of possible neurological complications is beneficial in preventing and mitigating the impact of long-term sequelae and improving the prognostic outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Here, we review the main pathways of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and the potential mechanisms causing neurological damage. We also discuss in detail neurological complications, aiming to provide cutting-edge basis for subsequent related basic research and clinical studies of diagnosis and treatment.","Dai, Cao, Jiang, Wu, Lou, Shao, Hu, Lan","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcac272","20221209","COVID-19; Neuroinvasion; Neurological complications; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42293,""
"Lost in between crises: How do COVID-19 threats influence the motivation to act against climate change and the refugee crisis?","While the COVID-19 pandemic has been found to undermine mental health, it is unclear how it may impact individuals&#x2019; motivation to tackle other global crises. There are at least two perspectives on how COVID-19 might psychologically impact how people respond to other global crises. The finite-pool-of-worry hypothesis suggests that worrying about one issue might diminish worry about other issues since individuals have a limited capacity of worry. Conversely, the affect-generalization hypothesis advocates that worry about an issue might generalize to other issues and increase general levels of worry. To test these competing hypotheses, the present research investigated how threats activated by the COVID-19 pandemic might affect individuals&#x2019; interest in and motivation to address climate change (Study 1) and the refugee crisis (Study 2) by assessing pro-environmental behavior and prosocial behavior toward refugees, respectively. The results showed that exposure to COVID-19 threats elevated anxiety levels, and trait anxiety, psychological distance, and future orientation moderated this effect. While COVID-19 threats did not influence pro-environmental and prosocial behavior and intentions, exploratory analyses uncovered that being psychologically closer to COVID-19 might predict an increase in pro-environmental and prosocial behavior and intentions, pointing to the affect-generalization hypothesis.","Ekinci, Van Lange","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101918","20221210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42294,""

"ARE THERE STILL ENDOGENOUS AND REACTIVE DEPRESSIONS? CLINICAL NOTES FROM A REFRACTORY COTARD SYNDROME WITH A DE NOVO POST-ECT DISSOCIATIVE EPISODE","Cotard syndrome is a mysterious and severe disorder. Many therapeutic interventions are reported as potentially efficacious mostly when an underlying psychotic depression or melancholia is diagnosed. However, the classification of depression has long been a contentious issue. Even though the major guide for therapeutic choice is severity, the binary model between endogenous and reactive depression is still widely employed in clinical practice. These considerations impact most clearly in in-between presentations. The authors present the case of R., a 64Â year old woman, who was admitted with a major depressive episode with psychotic features, captured as a Cotard-like syndrome. After a two-months inpatient period and apparent clinical remission with high dose antidepressants and antipsychotic combination, she displayed an acute worsening leading to a re-admission just a day after discharge. The management in this second admission was tortuous, due to SARS-CoV2 related contingencies, the refractoriness of the presentation and iatrogenic intercurrences. The authors expose the course and treatment options employed, while reflecting on the question endogenous v. reactive, concluding that even seemingly clear clinical presentations may resist our different conceptualizations.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psiq.2022.100379","20220901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42298,""

Participants completed the Faceted Inventory of the Five-Factor Model (FI-FFM, Watson et al., 2019) and the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2, Soto & John, 2017) at four waves across four years. Latent growth modeling showed significant mean level decreases in Openness, Neuroticism, and Extraversion at the domain level. At the facet-level, significant decreases were found for Aesthetic Sensitivity, Creative Imagination, Intellectual Curiosity, Anxiety, Anger Proneness, Positive Temperament, Venturesomeness, Ascendence, Empathy, Trust, and Achievement Striving. Regressions from exposure level, age, and sex on personality change were examined and significant effects were also observed. Results highlight the importance of facet-level analysis, as significant change was found only for certain facets within domainsâ€”sometimes when the domains showed no change.

"Does dispositional preference for solitude predict better psychological outcomes during times of social distancing? Beliefs and reality","Objective. People value solitude for themselves. Yet little is known about how people perceive dispositional preference for solitude in others. Does dispositional preference for solitude represent a protective factor from psychological distress during times of social distancing? And do laypeople have accurate beliefs about the role of preference for solitude? Method. To answer these questions, we conducted four studies (three preregistered, Ntotal = 1,418) at the early and a later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic using experimental, longitudinal, and experience sampling designs. Results. People expected targets with a higher solitude preference to be more resilient (e.g., less lonely, more satisfied with life) during social distancing, and consequently prioritize them less when allocating supportive resources for maintaining social connections (Studies 1 & 2). Compared to these beliefs, the actual difference between individuals with higher versus lower solitude preference was smaller (Study 2) or even negligible (Study 3). Did people form more calibrated beliefs two years into the pandemic? Study 4 suggested no. Conclusions. Together, these studies show that people overestimate the role of preference for solitude in predicting othersâ€™ psychological experience. As a result, solitude seeking individuals may miss out on supportive resources, leading to higher risks for mental health issues.","Dongning Ren et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0051-BBD-3F8","20221209","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-12","",42301,""
