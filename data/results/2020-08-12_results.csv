"Prevalence of Psychological Morbidities Among General Population, Healthcare Workers and COVID-19 patients Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","This review was done to synthesise the existing evidence on the prevalence of various psychological morbidities among general public, healthcare workers and COVID-19 patients amidst this pandemic situation  Systematic searches were conducted in various databases and search engines such as Medline, Chinese national knowledge infrastructure, Cochrane library, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from inception until 22 April 2020  Newcastle Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of included studies  We carried out a meta-analysis with random-effects model and reported pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)  A total of 50 studies were included in the review  Only seven studies (14%) had low risk of bias  Pooled prevalence rate of psychological morbidities includes poor sleep quality (40%), stress (34%), psychological distress (34%), insomnia (30%), post-traumatic stress symptoms (27%), anxiety (26%), depression (26%)  Pooled prevalence rate of psychological morbidities with respect to impact of event due to COVID-19 pandemic was 44% (95%CI-42% to 47%)  The burden of these psychological morbidities was highest among the COVID-19 patients followed by healthcare workers and general population","Krishnamoorthy, Yuvaraj; Nagarajan, Ramya; Saya, Ganesh Kumar; Menon, Vikas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113382","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;2020.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3764,""
"COVID-19 and the changes in sexual behavior of men who have sex with men: Results of an online survey","Background Social-distancing in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect sexual behavior of men who have sex with men (MSM)  In early March 2020, Israel imposed travel restrictions and limited social contacts to household members only  The effects of these restrictions on MSM sexual behavior and mental health are unknown  Aim To assess sexual behaviors and mental health of Israeli MSM during social-distancing, and to compare sexual behaviors before and during social distancing, due to the COVID-19  Methods Data was collected through anonymous web-based questionnaires in a popular geospatial application used by MSM between March and April 2020 during the social-distancing period  Outcomes The dependent variable was casual sex, in violation of Social-distancing regulations  Independent variables were demographic characteristics;sexual behaviors before and during social-distancing restrictions;and mental health  Results Of the 2,562 participants, 1,012 (39 5%) continued to meet new casual sex partners during this period  Being of a younger age, single, and with higher levels of mental distress predicted engagement in casual sex during the social-distancing period  MSM reduced their sexual risk and limited sexual repertoire â€“ in particular, kissing with their sexual partners  Participants also spent more time in dating applications than in the pre- social-distancing, and increased their use of sex-phone, web-cams and porn consumption  They perceived the threat of SARS-CoV-2 to be greater than that of HIV: only 3 2% could imagine themselves having sex with a partner who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with 30 1% in case of HIV, p&lt;0 01  Clinical Implications MSM reduced their risk behaviors during social-distancing, due to the threat of COVID-19  Casual sex during social-distancing was associated with negative feelings of mental distress  Future public health response in the future waves of COVID-19 morbidity should strike a balance between containment measures, and the need for social-distancing with its possible mental and social burdens  Strengths and Limitations This is the first study in Israel, and one of the few in the world to examine sexual behavior among MSM during the COVID-19 social-distancing  It involved a relatively large sample, through convenience sampling, which limits causality  Findings should be interpreted cautiously- specifically since COVID-19 related behaviors and circumstances may change rapidly  Conclusion The negative feelings of distress due to social-distancing should be considered as a potential barrier to adherence among vulnerable populations, such as MSM  Future public health response should strike a balance between containment measures and its possible mental, social and financial burdens","Shilo, Guy; Mor, Zohar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.07.085","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Journal of Sexual Medicine;2020.; Publication details: The Journal of Sexual Medicine;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3765,""

"Psychological Distress Related to COVID-19 â€“ The Contribution of Continuous Traumatic Stress","Objective The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress  Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors  This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis  Method An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population  The sample included 976 participants  Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS  Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed  Results Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19  Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress  Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events  CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS  Limitations This study relied on convenience sampling  Conclusions Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19","Lahav, Yael","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.141","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3767,""

"Panic and pandemic: narrative review of the literature on the links and risks of panic disorder as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Although the â€˜panicâ€™ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder  Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)  Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e g , respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation  Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis  Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder â€“ i e , fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities â€“ are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 pandemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not  In people with the comorbidity (i e , panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions  For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting  Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety relief  The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19)","Javelot, H.; Weiner, L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.08.001","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: L'EncÃ©phale;2020.; Publication details: L'EncÃ©phale;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3769,""

"The constitutional economics of the World Health Organization","This paper brings a constitutional economics perspective to bear on the World Health Organization (WHO), the flagship United Nations intergovernmental health organisation, which is obligated by its Constitution to achieve 'the highest possible level of health' for the world's peoples. The WHO has in the seven decades of its existence used its formidable legislative powers only sparingly. It has been widely chided for being weak in regional coordination and unresponsive to transnational emergencies like the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. In 2020, it found itself at the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the middle of the Sino-American geopolitical tug-of-war. This paper traces the discordance between the Constitution's stated purposes and the actual track record of the WHO not back to its organisational culture nor to weak leadership but to the design of the Constitution itself. It analytically distinguishes the Constitution's expressive from its instrumental halves, and shows that, whilst the former embodies a 'constitutional moment' of international health solidarity right after the Second World War, the latter embodies a reserved and limited delegation from member-states that are jealous of their sovereignty.","Ip, Eric C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1744133120000249","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Econ Policy Law;: 1-15, 2020 Aug 03.; Publication details: Health Econ Policy Law;: 1-15, 2020 Aug 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3772,""

"The Protective Impact of Telemedicine on Persons with Dementia and their Caregivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","ABSTRACT Objectives Social distancing under the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted access to community services for older adults with neurocognitive disorder (NCD) and their caregivers  Telehealth is a viable alternative to face-to-face service delivery  Telephone calls alone, however, may be insufficient  Here, we evaluated whether supplementary telehealth via video-conferencing platforms could bring additional benefits to care-recipient with NCD and their spousal caregivers at home  Participants Sixty older adults NCD-and-caregiver dyads were recruited through an activity centre  Design, Intervention The impact of additional services delivered to both care-recipient and caregiver through video conference (n=30) was compared with telehealth targeted at caregivers by telephone only (n=30), over 4 weeks in a pretest-posttest design  Interviews and questionnaires were conducted at baseline and study's end  Measurements, Results Supplementary telemedicine had averted the deterioration in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment evident in the telephone-only group (<U+03B7>p2=0 50)  It also reversed the falling trend in quality of life observed in the telephone only group (QoL-AD, <U+03B7>p2=0 23)  Varying degrees of improvements in physical and mental health (Short-Form 36 v2), perceived burden (Zarit Burden Interview Scale) and self-efficacy (Revised Caregiving Self-Efficacy Scale) were observed among caregivers in the video-conferencing group, which were absent in the telephone-only group (<U+03B7>p2=0 23â€“0 51)  Conclusions Telehealth by video conference was associated with improved resilience and wellbeing to both people with NCD and their caregivers at home  The benefits were visible already after 4 weeks and unmatched by telephone alone  Video conference as the modus operandi of telehealth beyond the context of pandemic-related social distancing should be considered","Lai, Frank Ho-yin; Yan, Elaine Wai-hung; Chan, Daniel Ting-hoi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.019","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry;2020.; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3783,""
"Potential Zoonotic Origins of SARS-CoV-2 and Insights for Preventing Future Pandemics Through One Health Approach","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has resulted in a global pandemic and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)  Zoonotic diseases are infections that are transmitted from animals to humans  COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated in bats and transmitted to humans through a possible intermediate host  Based on published research so far, pangolins are considered the most likely intermediate hosts  Further studies are needed on different wild animal species, including pangolins that are sold at the same wet market or similar wet markets before concluding pangolins as definitive intermediate hosts  SARS-CoV-2 is capable of reverse zoonosis as well  Additional research is needed to understand the pathogenicity of the virus, especially in companion animals, modes of transmission, incubation period, contagious period, and zoonotic potential Â Interdisciplinary one health approach handles these mosaic issues of emerging threats by integrating professionals from multiple disciplines like human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, and social sciences  Given that the future outbreak of zoonotic diseases is inevitable, importance must be given for swift identification of the pathogen, source, and transmission methods  Countries should invest in identifying the hot spots for the origin of zoonotic diseases, enhance diagnostic capabilities, and rapid containment measures at local, regional, and national levels  The threat posed by emerging infectious diseases in modern-days also needs combined efforts internationally where a single discipline or nation cannot handle the burden alone","Konda, Muralikrishna; Dodda, Balasunder; Konala, Venu Madhav; Naramala, Srikanth; Adapa, Sreedhar","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8932","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Cureus;12(6):e8932-e8932, 2020.; Publication details: Cureus;12(6):e8932-e8932, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3784,""

"Anxiety and hopelessness levels in COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative study of healthcare professionals and other community sample in Turkey","COVID-19 affected our mental health as well as our physical health. In this study, the anxiety and hopelessness levels of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and the factors affecting them were evaluated in Turkey. Beck Hopelessness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied online to participants. Totally 2156 individuals were included in the study and 52.0% (n:1121) of them are healthcare workers. The hopelessness and state anxiety levels of healthcare workers were higher than non-healthcare workers. Nurses' hopelessness levels are higher than doctors, and state anxiety levels are higher than both doctors and other healthcare workers. Anxiety and hopelessness levels were higher in women, those living with a high-risk individual at home during the pandemic, those who had difficulty in caring for their children, and those whose income decreased. Anxiety levels are an important predictor of hopelessness. The increase in anxiety levels explained 28.9% of the increase in hopelessness levels. Increased working hours is one of the important factors affecting anxiety. As a conclusion, healthcare workers were more affected psychologically in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the society. Nurses were affected more than other healthcare workers. It is important to identify the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and individuals who may be more psychologically affected during the pandemic. An important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by ensuring that psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups are planned in advance.","Hacimusalar, Yunus; Kahve, Aybeniz Civan; Yasar, Alisan Burak; Aydin, Mehmet Sinan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.024","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Psychiatr Res;129: 181-188, 2020 Jul 21.; Publication details: J Psychiatr Res;129: 181-188, 2020 Jul 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3787,""

"Perceived Risk and Protection From Infection and Depressive Symptoms Among Healthcare Workers in Mainland China and Hong Kong During COVID-19","Psychological health among healthcare workers (HCWs) has become a major concern since the COVID-19 outbreak. HCWs perceived risks of contracting COVID-19, in relation to depression were investigated. It was hypothesized that perceived high risk of contracting COVID-19 (close contact with cases, inadequate provision of personal protective equipment, insufficient infection control training, and presence of symptoms) would be significant predictors of depression. Our cross-sectional survey was completed by HCWs across three regions (Hubei, Guangdong, Hong Kong) between March 9 to April 9 2020 using convenience sampling. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Prevalence of depression was 50.4% (95% CI: 44.5-56.2), 15.1% (10.1-21.9) and 12.9% (10.3-16.2) for HCWs in Hong Kong, Hubei and Guangdong, respectively. The strongest significant risk factors for depression, after adjustment, were HCWs who reported the greatest extent of feeling susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and those who reported the greatest difficulty obtaining face masks. HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression. Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is essential for the psychological health of HCWs working in stressful environments, through potentially easing their perceptions of vulnerability to COVID-19.","Lam, Simon Ching; Arora, Teresa; Grey, Ian; Suen, Lorna Kwai Ping; Huang, Emma Yun-Zhi; Li, Daofan; Lam, Kin Bong Hubert","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00686","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Psychiatry;11: 686, 2020.; Publication details: Front Psychiatry;11: 686, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3789,""

"COVID-19 and acute inpatient psychiatry: the shape of things to come","Psychiatric services that provide acute inpatient care have to respond to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic to consistently deliver high standards of treatment to patients and ensure the safety of staff. This can only be achieved by fostering a culture that rewards initiative and empowers inpatient teams to implement and comply with changes which everyone understands and benefits from. The experience of an inner London acute psychiatric unit has shown the value of combining proactive leadership, multidisciplinary decision making and good communication in adapting services to an everchanging environment. Practical solutions have emerged that have improved service delivery and patient care, and which will likely outlast the COVID-19 pandemic. These include changes to team work and routine, streamlining patient care with a focus on goal directed admissions, developing a healthier work environment and adopting novel technology in patient care and multidisciplinary collaboration. KEY POINTS Psychiatric inpatient units have to manage the COVID-19 crisis alongside the risk of acutely disturbed behaviour, while ensuring high standards of care and patient throughput. To respond to the COVID-19 crisis, inpatient units have to foster a culture that rewards initiative and empowers teams to implement and comply with changes that everyone understands and benefits from. Adaptive strategies should include good communication, a healthy work environment, flexible rules, dynamic infection control and adopting novel technology for clinical care and multidisciplinary work.

"Patient experiences of fertility clinic closure during the COVID-19 pandemic: appraisals, coping and emotions","STUDY QUESTION: What are appraisals, coping strategies and emotional reactions of patients to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fertility clinic closures? SUMMARY ANSWER: Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Psychological research on COVID-19 suggests that people are more anxious than historical norms and moderately to extremely upset about fertility treatment cancellation owing to COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a mixed-methods, English language, anonymous, online survey posted from April 09 to April 21 to social media. Eligibility criteria were being affected by COVID-19 fertility clinic closure, 18 years of age or older and able to complete the survey in English. In total, 946 people clicked on the survey link, 76 did not consent, 420 started but did not complete survey, and 450 completed (48% completion, 446 women, four men). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Overall 74.7% (n = 336) of respondents were residents in the UK with an average age of 33.6 years (SD = 4.4) and average years trying to conceive, 3.5 years (SD = 2.22). The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. Open-text questions covered their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on reproductive health and fertility plans, concerns and perceived benefits of clinic closure, and knowledge about closure. Sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data. Thematic qualitative analysis (inductive coding) was performed on the textual data from each question. Deductive coding grouped themes from each question into meta-themes related to cognitive stress and coping theory. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most patients (81.6%, n = 367) had tests or treatments postponed, with these being self (41.3%, n = 186) or publicly (46.4%, n = 209) funded. Patients appraised fertility clinic closure as having potential for a more negative than positive impact on their lives, and to be very or extremely uncontrollable and stressful (p &#8804; .001). Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. Data saturation was achieved with all open-text questions, with 33 broad themes identified and four meta-themes linked to components of the cognitive stress and coping theory. First, participants understood clinic closure was precautionary due to unknown effects of COVID-19 but some felt clinic closure was unfair relative to advice about getting pregnant given to the public. Second, closure was appraised as a threat to attainability of the parenthood goal largely due to uncertainty of the situation (e.g., re-opening, effect of delay) and intensification of pre-existing hardships of fertility problems (e.g., long time waiting for treatment, history of failed treatment). Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g., distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date. Finally, participants reported more negative than positive emotions (p &#8804;  .001) and almost all participants reported stress, worry and frustration at the situation, while some expressed anger and resentment at the unfairness of the situation. Overall, 11.9% were not at all able to cope, with reports of intense feelings of hopelessness and deteriorating wellbeing and mental health. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The survey captures patient reactions at a specific point in time, during lockdown and before clinics announced re-opening. Participants were self-selected (e.g., UK residents, women, 48% starting but not completing the survey), which may affect generalisability. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertility stakeholders (e.g., clinics, patient support groups, regulators, professional societies) need to work together to address the great uncertainty from COVID-19. This goal can be met proactively by setting up transparent processes for COVID-19 eventualities and signposting to information and coping resources. Future psychological research priorities should be on identifying patients at risk of distress with standardised measures and developing digital technologies appropriate for the realities of fertility care under COVID-19.

"Strategy for the Practice of Spine Oncological Surgery During the Covid-19 Pandemic","STUDY DESIGN: Case series. OBJECTIVE: For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the COVID 19 pandemics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The organization of healthcare has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of Spinal Tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. METHODS: An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons and radiation oncologists was formed to analize the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during COVID 19 pandemics. RESULTS: Spine Metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture and/or neurological symptoms. Primary Spine Tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, in order to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like enbloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like Chordoma or Chondrosarcomas, if Intensive Care Unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing's Sarcoma (ES) and Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. When delaying surgery (chemotherapy completed or toxicity), is essential to avoid contact between immune depressed and Covid-19 patients, during the hospital stay for surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Even more than during normal times, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to share the decision to modify a treatment strategy.

"Viral, host and environmental factors that favor anthropozoonotic spillover of coronaviruses: An opinionated review, focusing on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2","Environmental factors play a key role in the zoonotic transmission of emerging pathogenic viruses as mankind is constantly disturbing wildlife's ecosystems usually by cutting down forests to build human settlements or by catching wild animals for food, which deprives the viruses of their natural hosts and gives them opportunity to infect humans  In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization  Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002â€“2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species  This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV  This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses","da Silva, Priscilla Gomes; Mesquita, JoÃ£o Rodrigo, de SÃ£o JosÃ© Nascimento, Maria; Ferreira, Vanessa Andreia Martins","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Science of The Total Environment;2020.; Publication details: Science of The Total Environment;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3798,""

"Patients With Voice Prosthesis Rehabilitation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analyzing the Effectiveness of Remote Triage and Management","OBJECTIVE: To describe a remote approach used with patients with voice prosthesis after laryngectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting clinical outcomes in terms of voice prosthesis complications management, oncological monitoring, and psychophysical well-being. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Otolaryngology Clinic of the University Polyclinic A. Gemelli, IRCCS Foundation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients with voice prosthesis who underwent laryngectomy followed by our institute were offered enrollment. Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed to inquire about the nature of the need and to plan a video call with the appropriate clinician. Before and 1 week after the clinician's call, patients were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Degrees of satisfaction were investigated with a visual analog scale. A comparison between those who accepted and refused telematic support was carried out to identify factors that influence patient interest in teleservice. RESULTS: Video call service allowed us to reach 37 (50.68%) of 73 patients. In 23 (62.16%) of 37 cases, the video call was sufficient to manage the problem. In the remaining 14 cases (37.83%), an outpatient visit was necessary. Participants who refused telematic support had a significantly shorter time interval from the last ear, nose, and throat visit than patients who accepted (57.95 vs 96.14 days, P = .03). Video-called patients showed significantly decreased levels of anxiety and depression (mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score pre- vs post-video call: 13.97 vs. 10.23, P < .0001) and reported high levels of satisfaction about the service. CONCLUSION: Remote approach may be a viable support in the management of patients with voice prosthesis rehabilitation.","Longobardi, Ylenia; Galli, Jacopo; D'Alatri, Lucia; Savoia, Vezio; Mari, Giorgia; Rigante, Mario; Passali, Giulio Cesare; Bussu, Francesco; Parrilla, Claudio","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0194599820948043","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg;: 194599820948043, 2020 Aug 04.; Publication details: Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg;: 194599820948043, 2020 Aug 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3800,""

"What Media Helps, What Media Hurts: A Mixed Methods Survey Study of Coping with COVID-19 Using the Media Repertoire Framework and the Appraisal Theory of Stress","BACKGROUND: Social and physical distancing in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has made screen-mediated information and communication technologies (media) indispensable. Whether an increase in screen use is a source of or a relief for stress remains to be seen. OBJECTIVE: In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns, we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media use. Based on Lazarus's transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesize that individual differences in the appraisal of media predict variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. METHODS: Between March 20 and April 20, 2020, a brief snowball survey entitled: ""What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens"" was distributed via Concordia University's mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media repertoire method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in use, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, and ignore) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media use by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender, and self-reported mental health. RESULTS: More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the United States. From 685 completed responses, 169 respondents were ""very stressed"" and 452 were ""slightly worried"" about the pandemic. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (&#967;23=11.76, P=.008), television (&#967;23=12.40, P=.006), YouTube (&#967;23=8.577, P=.04), and streaming services such as Netflix (&#967;23=10.71, P=.01). Respondents who considered their mental health ""not good"" were twice as likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and nonbinary respondents were twice as likely than men to pick social media for coping. Individuals younger than 35 years were 3 times more likely to pick computer games, and individuals older than 55 years were more likely to pick network television or print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (less in men than others) in terms of avoid (F1,637=5.84, P=.02) and approach scores (F1,637=14.31, P<.001). Subjective mental health affected the ignore score (less in those who said ""good"" than others; F1,637=13.88, P<.001). The appraisal score and use increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) were important for coping if they provided support and connection through the dissemination of factual and positive information while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between appraisal of media's positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. The media repertoire approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pahayahay, Amber; Khalili-Mahani, Najmeh","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20186","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(8): e20186, 2020 Aug 06.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(8): e20186, 2020 Aug 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3803,""
"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on informal settlements in Tshwane Gauteng Province, South Africa","Informal settlements remain a public health problem as they lack basic infrastructure. Furthermore, it is challenging to enforce public health regulations and protocols to prevent the spread of infection during a pandemic. This paper was set out to explore the impact of lockdown during COVID-19 among people living in informal settlements. An exploratory qualitative design was utilised. Purposive sampling was used to select research participants. In-depth one-to-one interviews were held involving 30 research participants through a WhatsApp online telephone platform. A thematic approach underpinned by the four stages of data analysis in interpretive phenomenological analysis was utilised to analyse the data. The study found that during the the research participants were affected by lack of space to practice social distancing, over-burdened infrastructure, lack of savings, loss of income and shortage of food, hunger and diseases, anxiety and depression and poor access to education. There is a need to prioritise the needs of informal settlers and endeavour to establish permanent homes. Health promotion and communication initiatives and pandemic awareness programmes are needed to mitigate the impact of lockdown during a pandemic in informal settlements.","Nyashanu, Simbanegavi, Gibson","https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1805787","20200811","COVID-19; Pandemic; informal settlements; isolate; social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3804,""

"Droplet and Aerosol Generation With Endonasal Surgery: Methods to Mitigate Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To define the aerosol and droplet risks associated with endonasal drilling and to identify mitigation strategies. Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. Dedicated surgical laboratory. Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 Ã‚Âµm. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols Ã¢â€°Â¤3.30 Ã‚Âµm, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols Ã¢â€°Â¤14.1 Ã‚Âµm. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols Ã¢â€°Â¤14.1 Ã‚Âµm, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares. Given the findings regarding aerosol risk reduction, we strongly recommend that physicians use a suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during endonasal surgery in the COVID-19 era.","Dharmarajan, Freiser, Sim, Boorgu, Corcoran, Wang, Gardner, Snyderman","https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820949802","20200811","COVID-19; aerosol; droplet; endonasal; prevention; safety; skull base","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3806,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on 'hidden' frontline healthcare workers","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to rising death tolls and stressed healthcare systems, resulting in an unprecedented psychological stress on healthcare workers worldwide. However, the majority of studies only accounted for frontline healthcare workers with direct patient exposure. This study aims to look at the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a specific, vulnerable and yet hidden group of healthcare workers, namely laboratory healthcare workers who are at high risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus from handling infected patients' blood samples, in addition to a marked increase in workload. A multicentre study was conducted in Singapore via online questionnaire looking at psychological and physical impact of COVID-19 on laboratory healthcare workers. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Numeric rating scale on fear (NRS) were validated scores used in this study. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 23 (IBM Corp). A total of 122 staffs participated and more than half of the cohort experienced mild to severe fear, anxiety and depression. Increase in depression score was also found to be associated with increased physical exhaustion (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-29.1, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02), loss of appetite (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.0, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02), poor sleep quality (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 2.9-19.4, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005), and the use of sedative (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-13.5, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03).

Between April 21-May 21, 2020, 93 older adults in the United States who had completed measures characterizing their personal social networks, subjective loneliness, and depression six to nine months prior to the pandemic completed the same measures via phone interview, as well as questions about the impact of the pandemic on their social relationships. Older adults reported higher depression and greater loneliness following the onset of the pandemic. Loneliness positively predicted depression. Perceived relationship strength, but not social engagement, moderated this relationship such that loneliness only predicted depression for individuals who became closer to their networks during the pandemic. For those who felt less close, depression was higher irrespective of loneliness. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted older adults' mental health and social well-being in the short-term. Potential long-term impacts are considered.","Krendl, Perry","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa110","20200811","COVID-19; aging; depression; loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3808,""

"Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 roles in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19","The new pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a wide range of clinical consequences, from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and it is very heterogeneous. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well recognized as a key regulating system in circulatory homeostasis that play prominent roles in pathophysiological processes in abnormal activation for instance renal and cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and stroke. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a component of the RAS system. However, unlike the ACE, its activity is not inhibited by the ACE inhibitors. The major product of ACE2 is Ang1-7, known as a vasodilator peptide and part of the depressant arm of the RAS. There are two form of ACE2. Coronavirus cover with some proteins in order to help viral attachment to the cell membrane ACE2 as a receptor and then fuse and enter the cells. ACE2 was expressed in oral Cavity, salivary glands of the mouth, esophagus, myocardial cells, kidney, and enterocytes, along all the respiratory tract, intestine, and blood vessels. In this article, we explain the renin-angiotensin system and its components. Also, we shortly explain the organs involved in COVID-19 disease and we will talk about the possible causes of damage to these organs. We also reviewed the probable mechanism of using ACE2 in viral attachment and the probable treatment processes will also be discussed based on the surface proteins of the virus and ACE2.

"Is the mental health of young students and their family members affected during the quarantine period? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in Albania","WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Mental health is deteriorated during the quarantine period. Mental health status is affected by the quarantine even after the end of it and for an extended period. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Depression levels among nursing/midwifery students during the quarantine period are high. Depression levels among students' family members during the quarantine period are high. Those who are not satisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures and those who believe that COVID-19 and quarantine can cause problems on health, have elevated levels of depression. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period should be a priority for the healthcare system. Offering mental health first aid training and support can improve the mental health status of students and their family members. ABSTRACT: Introduction The use of quarantine method has a significant impact on mental health status. Aim This study aimed to assess the levels of depression among bachelor and master university students (nurses/midwives) and their family members' during the quarantine period of COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vlora University, Albania. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used. Institutional e-mails of all active students were used for their recruitment. Results In total, 863 students and 249 family members participated in the study. The mean PHQ-9 score was 6.220 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.803) and 6.280 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.857) for students and family members, respectively. Being unsatisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures, beliefs that COVID-19 infection and quarantine process can cause problems on their health status were the key factors for students to be screened positive for mental problems in multiple regression analysis. For parents, the last two factors were found to contribute significantly. Discussion Our findings indicate that quarantine measures have a significant impact on the levels of depression among both university students and their family members. Broader population studies are necessary to safeguard these results. Implications for Practice Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period is of paramount significance. Mental health first aid training and support could benefit both students and their parents significantly. Additionally, follow-up services after the end of quarantine are recommended.","Mechili, Saliaj, Kamberi, Girvalaki, Peto, Patelarou, Bucaj, Patelarou","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12672","20200811","COVID-19; PHQ-9; depression; family members; quarantine; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-12","",3811,""
