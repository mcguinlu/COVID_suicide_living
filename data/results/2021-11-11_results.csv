"Association between long working hours and psychological distress: The effect of sick leave criteria in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic","ObjectiveThis study investigated the effect of sick leave criteria on the association between long working hours and psychological distress.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey in December 2020, and 27,032 workers completed the questionnaire. First, after testing the interaction effect of overtime work hours and sick leave criteria on psychological distress, we conducted stratified analyses using sick leave criteria.

ResultsA significant interaction effect was found. When we conducted stratified analyses, the odds ratios increased with longer working hours, both with and without sick leave criteria groups; however, the risk was greater in the without sick leave criteria group, compared with the criteria group.

ConclusionWe revealed that working without sick leave criteria could strengthen the association between long working hours and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Clinical significanceWorkers working without sick leave criteria had a significantly higher risk of psychological distress due to long working hours than those who worked with the criteria. Our findings contribute to preventing the deterioration of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ayako Hino; Akiomi Inoue; Kosuke Mafune; Mayumi Tsuji; Seiichiro Tateishi; Akira Ogami; Tomohisa Nagata; Keiji Muramatsu; Yoshihisa Fujino","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.07.21266036","20211108","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21655,""
"Sleep quality, mental health, and circadian rhythms during COVID lockdown â€“ results from the SleepQuest study","IntroductionBehavioural responses to COVID-19 lockdown will define the long-term impact of psychological stressors on sleep and brain health. Here, we tease apart factors that help protect against sleep disturbance. We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID-19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality.MethodsParticipants completed our online â€˜SleepQuestâ€™ Study between 29th April 2020- 13th May 2020 and were followed up between 5th November 2020 -2nd December 2020. The SleepQuest survey comprised a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and attitudes towards sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures.Results3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18-91) completed the baseline data with 2781 participants followed up. Results showed sleep quality was negatively affected by the first UK lockdown restriction [mean PSQI at baseline 8.12 (2.92)] however from baseline to follow up, sleep quality improved (mean PSQI Difference=2.21;95% CI=[2.12,2.33.]) Factors that predicted poor prolonged sleep quality were baseline sleep quality (P&lt;0.001), anxiety (P&lt;0.001) and attitudes towards sleep (P&lt;0.01). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in â€˜owlâ€™ (p=0.0002) and not â€˜larkâ€™ (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype.DiscussionWe have provided evidence to suggest anxiety and dysfunctional attitudes towards sleep predicted poorer prolonged sleep quality. Defining the interaction between chronotype, mental health and behaviour will be critical for targeted lifestyle adaptations to protect brain health through current and future crises.","Desai, Bhavisha, Carrigan, Neil, Wearn, Alfie, Blackman, Jonathan, Meky, Saba, Selwood, James, Piggins, Hugh, Turner, Nicholas, Greenwood, Rosemary, Coulthard, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-bssconf.29","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open Respiratory Research; 8(Suppl 1):A16, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Open Respiratory Research; 8(Suppl 1):A16, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21656,""
"Well-being and mental health of healthcare workers before, during, and after COVID-19","The World Health Organization states that peopleâ€™s mental health is as essential and important to our well-being as is our physical health (World Health Organization [WHO], 2021). This is because, when we feel mentally well, we can not only be productive and contribute to our communities, but we can also enjoy our free time (WHO, 2021), and arguably enjoy our lives. The recognition of this intricated relationship has led to multiple studies focused on identifying those factors impacting peopleâ€™s well-being and mental health. For example, alcohol consumption and obesity have been associated with poor mental health and quality of life (Rehm et al., 2009;Stranges, Savaraweera, Taggart, Kandala, & Stewart-Brown, 2014), while physical activity, adequate sleep, and consumption of fruits and vegetables have been associated with better health and well-being (Stranges et al., 2014;Franco et al., 2012). As well as having good social support and socioeconomic stability (Soldevila Domenech et al., 2021;Stewart-Brown, Samaraweera, Taggart, Kandala, & Stranges, 2015). Â© 2021. Salud Mental.

"Explicit and implicit attitudes toward people with COVID-19: Need for community mental health services","During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, social stigmatization of people who have been infected with the virus has been observed. This study measured the degree of social stigma by examining implicit and explicit attitudes toward people with COVID-19. Explicit attitudes were measured through self-reporting, taking into account the three components of behavior, cognition, and emotion, and we used the Single-Category Implicit Association Test to assess implicit attitudes. The findings show that explicit attitudes toward people with COVID-19 were positive, whereas implicit attitudes trended toward being negative. The results suggest that mental health services and policies are needed to reduce social stigma and prevent the risk of mental health problems among people who have been infected with COVID-19.","Choi, Yun Jung, Cho, Dong Hee","https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.10900","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Social Behavior and Personality; 49(11):1-11, 2021.; Publication details: Social Behavior and Personality; 49(11):1-11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21658,""

"Experience of shielding during first wave of COVID-19 amongst uk patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)","IntroductionIn March 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic. Specific shielding guidance produced by PHE aimed to protect clinically extremely vulnerable individuals. This included people with AIH on immunosuppressants. In the first wave, advice included not leaving home. The practicalities of this and impact of enforced shielding on mental health (MH) and well-being is not well documented, although suicide theories emphasise the negative effect of social isolation and loneliness. We conducted a patient survey to assess the impact of shielding in our AIH cohort.MethodsBetween 1Jul -10 Aug 2020,292 patients with AIH, fulfilling shielding criteria were invited to participate in a clinician designed survey on MSFormsÂ® online or by hand. Paper responses were entered online for analysis.Results36%(104)participated;79% female,74% age 25-69. Immunosuppression burden:50% single agent,47%dual, 3%on =3.Shielding compliance was ranked on a scale from 0-10:60% 9-10/10,29%7-8/10,11%0-6/10. Reasons for breaches included: exercise, shopping, to have a drive. Responses demonstrated assessment of risk by those breaching guidance. Ease with practical aspects of living were assessed on a scale from 0-10. One third found this â€˜very easyâ€™,1/3 â€˜quite easyâ€™,1/3 â€˜not very easyâ€™. For shopping, respondents used family members(49%),online(39%),shop in person(8%),other(4%).NHS volunteers were not used for shopping. Obtaining prescriptions was reported as easy in 79%: 76% used family/online pharmacy deliveries, other methods included: friend/neighbour, hospital delivery, NHS volunteer, collection in person. Of those with long-term partners 95% continued co-habiting but 4% lived separately in this period, remaining respondents previously lived alone. Respondents were asked to rank their MH and physical well-being. 27% reported MH as â€˜highâ€™, 27%â€˜moderateâ€™,46%â€˜lowâ€™.Whilst 87% had access to outdoor space, only 46% had access to space large enough to exercise. Questions on the impact of shielding on other household members highlighted the perceived loss of independence and â€˜guiltâ€™ associated with the negative impact of shielding on others. Pertaining to work/employment, 38%(40/104) were employed in March 2020. Of those answering the question â€˜How did you work during the shielding periodâ€™: 54% worked from home (WFH), prior to COVID-19 only 5% WFH. 2% continued to commute to work.ConclusionThis survey has provided a unique insight into shielding attitudes and behaviours in patients with AIH during the pandemic first wave demonstrating its negative impact on MH and well-being. As further evidence emerges regarding the risk of COVID-19 in adults taking immunosuppressants, more detailed risk stratification may be possible;this would be advantageous from a patient perspective.","Appleby, Victoria, Chimakurthi, Chenchu R.; Watson, Ceri, Gibson, Stewart, Hegade, Vinod, Nandasoma, Udvitha, Huggett, Matthew, Jones, Rebecca L.","https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-BSG.203","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A109-A110, 2021.; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 4):A109-A110, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21660,""
"Psychological Effects of Covid-19 Pandemic on Dental Students: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a psychological effect on the general population and healthcare workers. Dentists were not excluded from this and were placed in a high-exposure risk category for infection. This cross-sectional study used the DASS-21 scale to evaluate the level of depression, anxiety, and stress among dental students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of other variables on their responses. Continuous variables were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation, and categorical variables were expressed as percentages. The student's t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for continuous variables. Multiple linear regressions were also utilized. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 138 students contributed to the study. All participants (100%) were female, and 99.28% were single. The majority of the students were enrolled at King Saud University (81.88%), with 42.75% of the participants in the third year. High levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were reported among dental students during the pandemic: 73.2% of respondents had depression, 84.8% had anxiety, and 75.4% had stress. In addition to the stress of dental education itself, the contagious nature of this disease and those dentists were at a higher risk of contracting the infection affected the student's psychological health.","Alkawari, H.; Aljabaa, A.","https://doi.org/10.21786/bbrc/14.3.24","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Bioscience Biotechnology Research Communications; 14(3):1060-1064, 2021.; Publication details: Bioscience Biotechnology Research Communications; 14(3):1060-1064, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21661,""

"HUBUNGAN ANTARA SUMBER TEKANAN DAN TAHAP TEKANAN PSIKOLOGI DALAM KALANGAN KAKITANGAN PEJABAT KESIHATAN DAERAH SEPANG SEPANJANG PANDEMIK COVID-19","Pandemik COVID-19 yang melanda seluruh dunia telah memberikan impak yang cukup besar, bukan sahaja dari aspek ekonomi dan gaya hidup, malah kesejahteraan mental juga. Menjadi petugas barisan hadapan, petugas-petugas kesihatan merupakan golongan yang cukup terkesan dengan wabak ini, terutamanya dari segi kesihatan mental mereka. Oleh itu, kajian ini telah dijalankan bertujuan untuk mengenal pasti hubungan antara faktor tekanan dan tahap tekanan yang dialami oleh petugas kesihatan di Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah Sepang sepanjang berlakunya wabak COVID-19. Seramai 94 orang responden telah terlibat dalam kajian ini melalui kaedah persampelan bukan kebarangkalian. Faktor tekanan dinilai dari dua komponen, iaitu faktor beban kerja dan faktor pengurusan masa. Analisis data mendapati min tekanan disebabkan bebanan kerja (min=3.6902) adalah lebih tinggi berbanding faktor pengurusan masa (min=3.5436). Paras tekanan para petugas kesihatan pula berada pada tahap sederhana (min=3.1489). Hasil analisis korelasi mendapati tiada hubungan signifikan antara faktor beban kerja dengan tahap tekanan (p= 0.769) dan faktor pengurusan masa dengan tahap tekanan (p= 0.530). Dapatan yang tidak signifikan ini boleh disumbangkan beberapa faktor, antaranya jumlah responden yang kurang. Kajian akan datang disarankan untuk dijalankan dengan skala persampelan yang lebih besar bagi meningkatkan tahap ketepatan hasil kajian.Alternate abstract:The COVID-19 pandemic that hit the whole world has had a considerable impact, not only in terms of economic and lifestyle, but mental well-being as well.

The stress factor is evaluated by two components, namely the workload factor and the time management factor. Data analysis found that mean of stress factors due to workload (mean = 3.6902) were higher than time management factors (mean = 3.5436). The stress level of healthcare workers was at a moderate level (mean = 3.1489). The results of correlation analysis found that there is no significant relationship between workload factor with stress level (p = 0.769) and time management factor with stress level (p = 0.530). These insignificant findings can be contributed by several factors, for example the lack number of respondents involved and the sampling method used. Future studies are recommended to be conducted with a larger sampling scale, as well as the assistance and treatment that can be provided to the healthcare frontliners.","Lazin, Mohd Ferdaus bin Mat, Nor, Hilwa Abdullah Mohd, Saleh, Nur Hidayah Muhamad","https://www.google.com/search?q=HUBUNGAN+ANTARA+SUMBER+TEKANAN+DAN+TAHAP+TEKANAN+PSIKOLOGI+DALAM+KALANGAN+KAKITANGAN+PEJABAT+KESIHATAN+DAERAH+SEPANG+SEPANJANG+PANDEMIK+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: e-BANGI; 18(6):72-84, 2021.; Publication details: e-BANGI; 18(6):72-84, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21669,""

"The covid-19 pandemic and the mental health of health care workers (Literature review)","The COVID-19 pandemic is having a serious psychological impact on healthcare workers. There is an operational restructuring of medical institutions, the working conditions practically correspond to an emergency situation. Every day, medical workers receive a huge amount of new information in the form of orders, guidelines. This creates an additional load in the form of continuous ""information noise"". The problem of emotional burnout of doctors was acute even before the COVID-19 pandemic. According to numerous studies in different countries, almost half of doctors have high rates of emotional burnout, which is two times higher than those of the population employed in other areas of professional activity. The aim of the study is to review the theoretical and methodological foundations of the formation and development of emotional burnout in medical personnel during an increased epidemic threshold for a new coronavirus infection. The paper provides an analysis of literary sources devoted to the problem of burnout syndrome in medical workers presented in the Scientific electronic library eLibrary, as well as in the English-language textual database of medical and biological publications PubMed. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with many reasons that can adversely affect the formation and development of emotional burnout in medical personnel during an increased epidemic threshold for a new coronavirus infection. The provoking factors of the burnout syndrome (professional burnout) are the organizational factor (high workload, lack and shortage of PPE, insufficient (at the first stage) accumulated knowledge about the new coronavirus infection COVID-19);feeling of safety, threat and risk of infection;social isolation.

"A global perspective on psychologists' and their organizations' response to a world crisis","Around the world, individual psychologists have stepped up to deliver essential services to address the social and emotional sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many psychological organizations have also responded to this public health crisis, though their efforts may be less widely recognized. Psychological organizations engaged in preventive and mitigation efforts targeted, among others, the general public, local communities, and high-risk groups such as health care providers. They disseminated mental health information to the general public, trained laypersons to provide psychological first aid, and used research to design and evaluate public health responses to the pandemic. In some countries, psychological organizations contributed to the design and implementation of public health policies and practices. The nature of these involvements changed throughout the pandemic and evolved from reactive to proactive, from local to international. Several qualities appear key to the value, impact, and success of these efforts.

"Bringing together physical and mental health and promoting positive youth development in China","The overall development of adolescents is important for achieving the long-range goals for 2035 and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Since ""physical and mental health"" is fundamental for individual comprehensive development, it is necessary to pay attention to the physical and mental health of adolescents to promote their overall development. As far as the current situation is concerned, the development of the physical and mental health of Chinese adolescents shows positive improvement but still faces many challenges. The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has changed the lifestyle, learning habits and social interactions of adolescents to a great extent, exerting negative impacts on physical and mental development. In the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, it is necessary to further investigate the association between physical fitness with mental health, and to explore the various factors influencing this relationship. It is of great value to understand the importance of physical and mental health promotion of adolescents under the new conditions, in the maintenance and improvement of overall youth development at present and in the future.","Yin, XiaoJian, Zeng, ZhuPing","https://doi.org/10.16835/j.cnki.1000-9817.2021.01.002","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Chinese Journal of School Health; 42(1):5-9, 2021.; Publication details: Chinese Journal of School Health; 42(1):5-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21691,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health (anxiety and depression symptoms) in the United States of America","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious mental health impact in the United States of America, as well as all over the world. Objective: To assess some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of US adult population, as well as the relationship between the average number of new COVID-19 cases and the average frequency of symptoms of anxiety, of depression, and of anxiety or depression between April 23 and October 26 2020. Materials and methods: Retrospective study. Psychosocial and demographic data were obtained from the online community-based Household Pulse Survey website. Data about the number of new COVID-19 cases detected in USA during the study period were taken from the Our World in Data website. The Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the strength of the relationships between the average new cases of COVID-19 during the study period and the average frequency of symptoms of anxiety, of depression, and of anxiety or depression. These correlations were also assessed in a subgroup analysis (gender, age group, education level, and ethnicity). Results: A total of 1,351,911 US adults completed the survey. The average rates of symptoms of depression, of anxiety, and of anxiety or depression were 25.7Â±1.6%, 31.9Â±2.0%, and 36.8Â±2.0%, respectively. The average number of new COVID-19 cases was positively correlated with the mean frequency of symptoms of anxiety, of depression, and of anxiety or depression (r=0.858, r=0.710, and r=0.887;p&lt;0.001). Likewise, positive correlations between the average number of new cases and the mean frequency of anxiety or depressive symptoms were found in the subgroups (r=0.484-0.917). Conclusions: According to our results, the number of new COVID-19 cases detected during the study period in USA was positively correlated with the frequency of anxiety or depression symptoms in the participants, that is, as the number of new cases increased, so did the frequency of the symptoms of these mental disorders.

"Perception of physical self-concept in university students in times of confinement due to COVID-19","Confinement by COVID-19 has led to various social changes, but its impact on physical self-concept is unknown. The purpose of this work was to analyze the perception of physical self-concept in university students in times of confinement due to Covid-19. The Physical Self Questionnaire was applied to university students. For the selection of the sample the stratified random sampling procedure, for a total of 499 university students from BogotÃ¡, Colombia. The instrument obtained acceptable Cronbach's alpha values at the general level (.943) and by dimensions. In the perception of physical self-concept at a general level and by dimensions, men obtained better scores than women. In turn, students from higher socioeconomic strata have lower scores than those from lower strata. Regarding age, older university students present lower scores in self-esteem, muscular strength, physical condition and perceived competition. The implementation of intervention programs aimed at promoting mental health related to physical selfconcept, body image, self-esteem, in addition to other aspects of mental and physical health that may be affected by the COVID-19 confinement is important within universities.

"The social effects of COVID-19 pandemic","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to measure people's perceptions, attitudes, and behavior regarding the New Coronavirus Pandemic and the process itself in our country, to examine social tendencies towards the pandemic, and to develop recommendations for policymakers based on the findings. METHODS: According to the survey, 40 percent of the participants said their anxiety about death and dying has increased. In comparison, 51 percent reported that their anxiety about getting the virus has increased, and 79 percent stated that their anxiety about losing their loved ones has increased. Especially the existential anxiety of women, those in the lowest income group working in jobs that require close contact, is much higher than men. Strong social ties are an influential factor in alleviating people's anxiety. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the respondents stated they feared that they will not be able to meet their basic needs in the future, and 58 percent reported that their income has decreased after the pandemic;only 14.80 percent stated that they find people to be generally trustworthy. As the variables of age, income, and education level decrease, so does trust. The findings reveal that the level of trust is lower among women than men. The percentage of those who see coronavirus as ""a conspiracy of the great powers"" is 56.5 percent in Turkey. Twenty-seven percent of the respondents reported that verbal violence, and 17 percent said physical violence has increased around them after the coronavirus. On the other hand, 11 percent stated that verbal violence, while 4 percent stated that physical violence against them has increased during the same period. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This research shows that existential anxiety in society increases as the duration of the pandemic increases. Over time the people have become tired. The pandemic has triggered some negative attitudes such as indifference, weariness, and denial, resulting in developing a type of come-what-may mood in some people. Those who have relatively strong social ties (high level of trust) and those who rely on state institutions cope more easily with the uncertainty and anxiety posed by the pandemic. Social policies to be followed by the state are of vital importance to reduce the economic and psycho-social problems of the society."".","Ataman, K.; Bozkurt, V.; Goka, E.; Ilhan, M.

"Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, practices, and vaccine acceptance for coronavirus disease 2019 among the public in a mers-cov-endemic country","Objective: The objective of the study is to identify associations between the sociodemographic characteristics and the level of knowledge, scope of attitudes, and self-reported practices among adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Riyadh. Methods: A quantitative, cross-sectional study of adults was conducted using a multistage participatory approach between May 31 and June 7, 2020, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Results: Of 1364 study participants, 73.9% knew the descriptive type of COVID-19. Females showed a statistically significant higher knowledge composite (P &lt; 0.0001), and the majority had higher sufficient knowledge scores than males. Only 24.9% agreed that individuals could be tested positive for influenza and COVID-19 at the same time. Negative attitudes were highly prevalent among younger, unmarried, non-Saudi, male participants (P &lt; 0.05). 72.9% reported placing masks on infants or children under 2 years. Similarly, older age groups and Saudi females were better at practicing risk-based preventive controls for COVID-19 than younger age groups and non-Saudi males (P &lt; 0.0001). 60% expressed that if a vaccine would be available this year, they would feel it was rushed, while 56% would consider receiving it but would wait to see what happens to others. Conclusion: These findings could be helpful in guiding machine learning models in groups more affected by knowledge insufficiency, gaps in attitudes, and behavioral compliance.

"Addressing Structural Trauma: The Psychiatric Clinician Leader's Role","The devastating and disproportionate toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of color has drawn attention to longstanding disparities, traceable to systemic factors that result in structural trauma. As a medical specialty, psychiatry has begun to grapple with its own history of institutional racism, with calls for a multifaceted approach to proactively address upstream institutional factors that inflict structural trauma. Psychiatric clinician leaders can play important roles in addressing these factors. This work can occur through the individual psychiatrist's targeted exertion of facets of the clinician leader role. Here, we consider a previously described clinician leadership model (the Four Factor Model) through the lens of structural inequity. We link this model to the real-world example of the city of Philadelphia's efforts to address mental health inequities, demonstrating the application of different facets of the psychiatrist's leadership to address structural trauma in the context of local government.

"Disabled Individuals and Structural Trauma: Implications for Mental Health Providers","Nearly 61 million Americans, or approximately one of every five individuals in the United States, lives with a disability. For being such a substantial part of the population, the attention given to this group's needs in psychiatric training is inadequate. â€œAbleismâ€ (ie, practices and/or beliefs that devalue people with disabilities) is often the forgotten â€œismâ€ and is frequently omitted from discussions regarding inclusion. Disabilities are a part of the diversity of human experience, yet individuals with disabilities are at risk of being inadequately served by societal systems, including inequities in their experience with mental health care. In traditional medical training (be it medical school or osteopathic school), residency, fellowship, and continuing medical education classes, instruction regarding the disability system (ie, services available to those living with disabilities) is often lacking despite its relevance in informing comprehensive treatment plans for affected individuals. This article defines the goals of the disability system and then explores some of the drivers of mental health care inequities for people living with disabilities. It also discusses some practical implications of creating clinical environments and providing care for these individuals.

"Attitudes and Intentions toward COVID-19 Vaccination among Health Professions Students and Faculty in Qatar","A populationâ€™s desire to take the COVID-19 vaccine is an important predictor of a countryâ€™s future pandemic management. This cross-sectional study examines the impact of psychological and sociodemographic factors on attitudes toward and intentions to take the COVID-19 vaccine among students and faculty at four colleges of health professions and sciences at Qatar University. The data were collected through an online survey using Google Forms. The survey was distributed through various online platforms. Data analysis was conducted using Stata 16. Of the 364 participants, 9.89% expressed a high mistrust of vaccine safety, and 21.7% were uncertain about their levels of trust;28% expressed strong worries about unforeseen side effects, whereas 54.95% expressed moderate worries. Furthermore, 7.69% expressed strong concerns and 39.84% showed moderate concerns about commercial profiteering. Approximately 13% of the participants expressed a strong preference towards natural immunity, whilst 45.33% appeared to believe that natural immunity might be better than a vaccine. Importantly, 68.13% of the participants intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine once it became available, compared to 17.03% who were uncertain and 14.83% who were unwilling to be vaccinated. Our findings differ from the data on vaccine hesitancy among the general population of Qatar. We argue that this gap is due to scientific knowledge and domain of education. Furthermore, although knowledge and awareness may affect vaccine attitudes, mental health and sociodemographic factors play a role in shaping attitudes towards vaccines.","Zaidi, Amine, Elmasaad, Amal, Alobaidli, Hend, Sayed, Rana, Al-Ali, Dana, Al-Kuwari, Dana, Al-Kubaisi, Shaikha, Mekki, Yosra, Emara, Mohamed M.; Daher-Nashif, Suhad","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111275","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1275, 2021.; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1275, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21701,""
"Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccination among Veterans Experiencing Homelessness","Sufficient uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is key to slowing the spread of the coronavirus among the most vulnerable in society, including individuals experiencing homelessness. However, COVID-19 vaccination rates among the Veteran homeless population are currently unknown. This study examines the COVID-19 vaccination rate among homeless Veterans who receive care at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the factors that are associated with vaccine uptake. Using VA administrative and clinical data, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the sociodemographic, health-related, and healthcare and housing services utilization factors that influenced COVID-19 vaccine uptake during the first eight months of the vaccine rollout (December 2020â€“August 2021). Of the 83,528 Veterans experiencing homelessness included in the study, 45.8% were vaccinated for COVID-19. Non-white, older Veterans (65+), females, those who received the seasonal flu vaccine, and Veterans with multiple comorbidities and mental health conditions were more likely to be vaccinated. There was a strong association between COVID-19 vaccination and Veterans who utilized VA healthcare and housing services. VA healthcare and homeless service providers are particularly well-positioned to provide trusted information and overcome access barriers for homeless Veterans to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.","Balut, Michelle D.; Chu, Karen, Gin, June L.; Dobalian, Aram, Der-Martirosian, Claudia","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111268","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1268, 2021.; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1268, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21702,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Burden of Internet Addiction in the United States","Despite the extensive usage of the internet, little is known about internet addiction among Americans during the pandemic. A valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via MTurk to recruit a national sample of adult Americans to understand the nature and extent of internet addiction. A total of 1305 individuals participated in the study where the majority were males (64%), whites (78%), non-Hispanic (70%), married (72%), 18â€“35 years old (57%), employed full time (86%), and with a Bachelorâ€™s degree or higher (83%). The prevalence of internet addiction was distributed as no addiction (45%), probable addiction or risk of addiction (41%), and definite or severe addiction (14%). More than a fourth of the population had depression (28%) or anxiety (25%). Despite adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, definite/severe internet addiction was strongly predictive of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in multiple regression analyses. Those who were probably addicted or at risk of addiction were also more likely to have depression or anxiety. Compared to estimates before the pandemic, this study suggests an increase in internet addiction among U.S. adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Population-based interventions and mental health promotion strategies should focus on a reduction in internet consumption and screen time.","Khubchandani, Jagdish, Sharma, Sushil, Price, James H.","https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint2040031","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 2(4):402-409, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 2(4):402-409, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21703,""
"Increased Depression and Anxiety Disorders during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Children and Adolescents: A Literature Review","Depression and anxiety disorders are a serious and increasingly commonly diagnosed problem at present. The problem applies not only to adults but also, increasingly often, to children and adolescents as well. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the issue. There are still relatively few publications that show that quarantine and social isolation have a negative effect on the psychological well-being of children and adolescents. Above all, the situation applies to children and adolescents with pre-existing predispositions and to individuals suffering from mental disorders. The key factor in this situation seems to be putting the needs of young people first so that they can safely return to school. It is also important to provide them with effective treatment strategies and methods with which to deal with this stressful and potentially traumatic situation. Most of the mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic has been conducted in Asia and Europe, where the disease first spread. This article presents an overview of the results of the latest Polish and international studies on the increase in depression and anxiety disorders among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. It concludes with recommendations regarding mental health support for young people, and further directions for treatment are suggested.","Sniadach, Justyna, Szymkowiak, Sylwia, Osip, Przemyslaw, Waszkiewicz, Napoleon","https://doi.org/10.3390/life11111188","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Life; 11(11):1188, 2021.; Publication details: Life; 11(11):1188, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21704,""

Symptoms related to the mental sphere (mainly depression and anxiety) may be experienced by one third of the worldwide population. This entails the need for the effective and rapid treatment of depressive episodes. An effective drug seems to be s-ketamine, which was accepted in March 2019 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of drug-resistant depression. This drug provides a quick antidepressant effect with maximum effectiveness achieved after 24 h. It also appears to reduce the occurrence of suicidal thoughts. However, research into undesirable effects, especially in groups of people susceptible to psychotic episodes or those who use alcohol or psychoactive substances, is necessary.","Kowalczyk, Mateusz, Kowalczyk, Edward, Kwiatkowski, Pawel, Lopusiewicz, Lukasz, Sienkiewicz, Monika, Talarowska, Monika","https://doi.org/10.3390/life11111186","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Life; 11(11):1186, 2021.; Publication details: Life; 11(11):1186, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21705,""
"Factors Related to Womenâ€™s Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from a Two-Wave Longitudinal Study","Background. A growing body of research has highlighted the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on womenâ€™s mental health. Previous studies showed that women have higher levels of depression, anxiety and PTSD, and worse psychological adjustment than men, which also persisted after the earlier phase of the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate changes in womenâ€™s psychological distress during the pandemic and to evaluate the factors that have a more significant impact in predicting womenâ€™s psychological distress. Methods. This two-wave longitudinal study (T1 = Italian first lockdown, and T2 = second phase, when the restrictive measures were eased) involved 893 women (Mage = 36.45, SD = 14.48). Participants provided demographic and health data as well as measures of psychological distress, emotion regulation processes, and ability to tolerate uncertainty. Results. No significant changes were found in womenâ€™s psychological distress between T1 and T2, i.e., during and after the first lockdown. Lower social stability status and higher maladaptive emotional coping predicted high psychological distress. Conclusions. Results showed that modifiable psychological variables play a central role in predicting distress and indicated that emotion regulation interventions might be helpful in increasing psychological resilience and mitigating the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic within the female population.","Di Blasi, Maria, Albano, Gaia, Bassi, Giulia, Mancinelli, Elisa, Giordano, Cecilia, Mazzeschi, Claudia, Pazzagli, Chiara, Salcuni, Silvia, Lo Coco, Gianluca, Gelo, Omar Carlo Gioacchino, Lagetto, Gloria, Freda, Maria Francesca, Esposito, Giovanna, Caci, Barbara, Merenda, Aluette, Salerno, Laura","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111656","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11656, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11656, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21706,""
"The Prevalence of Mental Distress and Social Support among University Students in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study","Objectives: To examine the prevalence of mental distress among university students in Jordan. Methods: An online cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted between 12th of June and the 4th of August 2021 in Jordan to measure student mental stress using Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20). Results: A total of 1063 university students participated in the study. One-third of the participating students reported that they had a history of COVID-19 infection. More than half of the participating university students (65.7%) were found to have mental distress (measured symptomatically by the SRQ-20 with a score of eight or more). The average mental distress score was 9.8 (SD: 5.5) out of 20. Female students, students from non-medical colleges, students in their last years of study, students with chronic diseases and those with low income were associated with high levels of mental distress (p &lt; 0.05). With regards to social support, a moderate level of social support was received from three sources: persons considered as significant others, family members, and friends. The average social support score for the participating university students was 41.9 (SD: 10.3) out of 60 (equivalent to 69.8%). Conclusions: Mental distress is prevalent among university students in Jordan. There is a need for evidence-based governmental strategies and interventions that provide social support at universities such as self-help measures and professional mental health services as part of student health services that would be helpful to reduce the burden of mental distress of students and promote the mission of the integration of mental health in all university policies.","Abuhamdah, Sawsan M.

"The Cost Effectiveness of Ecotherapy as a Healthcare Intervention, Separating the Wood from the Trees","Internationally, shifts to more urbanised populations, and resultant reductions in engagements with nature, have been a contributing factor to the mental health crisis facing many developed and developing countries. While the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced recent trends in many countries to give access to green spaces more weight in political decision making, nature-based activities as a form of intervention for those with mental health problems constitute a very small part of patient pathways of care. Nature-based interventions, such as ecotherapy, are increasingly used as therapeutic solutions for people with common mental health problems. However, there is little data about the potential costs and benefits of ecotherapy, making it difficult to offer robust assessments of its cost-effectiveness. This paper explores the capacity for ecotherapy to be cost-effective as a healthcare intervention. Using a pragmatic scoping review of the literature to understand where the potential costs and health benefit lie, we applied value of information methodology to identify what research is needed to inform future cost-effectiveness assessments. We show that there is the potential for ecotherapy for people with mild to moderate common mental health problems to be cost-effective but significant further research is required. Furthermore, nature-based interventions such as ecotherapy also confer potential social and wider returns on investment, strengthening the case for further research to better inform robust commissioning.","Hinde, Sebastian, Bojke, Laura, Coventry, Peter","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111599","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11599, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11599, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21708,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ophthalmology Residents: A Narrative Review","The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically affected medical societies. We aim to provide an overview and summarize the information published so far concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology residency programs and the mental wellbeing of trainees, and to establish factors to help maintain successful residency training to ensure high-quality, specialist ophthalmic training. A literature search was conducted in October 2021 of the PubMed database for articles assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of ophthalmology trainees and on ophthalmology residency programs. Cross-sectional survey studies, editorials, articles in scientific journals, letters to editors, and commentaries were considered;finally, 19 studies were included after excluding abstract-only publications and conference posters. The studiesâ€™ demographic details, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and limitations were extracted. Our summarized information showed the alarmingly significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology traineesâ€™ mental health and the associated considerable changes in ophthalmic training programs. Thus, in future, virtual training and surgical simulators should be permanently introduced, in addition to traditional teaching, to complete successful ophthalmology residency programs. Additionally, we emphasize the need for a widely facilitated and encouraged access to psychological support programs for healthcare workers, including ophthalmologists.","Dub, Natalia, Konopinska, Joanna, Obuchowska, Iwona, Lisowski, Lukasz, Dmuchowska, Diana Anna, Rekas, Marek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111567","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11567, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11567, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21709,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chinese Postgraduate Studentsâ€™ Mental Health","To understand the mental health status of Chinese postgraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used three online questionnaires: self-rating anxiety (SAS) scale, self-rating depression (SDS) scale, and social avoidance and distress (SAD) scale. A total of 3137 postgraduate students from different regions of China participated in our study. We explored the relationship between participant characteristics and mental health using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). We found that the proportions of respondents with severe, mild, and moderate depression were 1.4%, 10.48%, and 21.99%, respectively, and the corresponding proportions of respondents with anxiety were 1.56%, 4.65%, and 14.69%, respectively. A one-way ANOVA revealed that the mental health statuses of the participants were different between the subgroups based on majors, classes, degree types, and the method of communication with advisors and students. A two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects on interaction and the method of communication with advisors and peers. These findings suggest that the mental health of postgraduate students should be monitored during the pandemic, especially when they are unable to communicate directly with their advisors or peers, and targeted psychological counselling must be focused on anxiety and depression.","Liang, Zhengyan, Kang, Derong, Zhang, Minqiang, Xia, Yuanlin, Zeng, Qing","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111542","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11542, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11542, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21710,""
"The Psychological and Behavioral Patterns of Online Psychological Help-Seekers before and during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Text Mining-Based Longitudinal Ecological Study","Online mental health service (OMHS) platforms have contributed significantly to the publicâ€™s mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. However, it remains unclear why the public used OMHS platforms for psychological help-seeking (PHS) behavior and how PHS behavior varied across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the ecological PHS behavior data from two OMHS platforms, we extracted population, psychological problems, and influential factors of PHS behavior by text mining and time series analysis methods. Seven top-ranked psychological problems (i.e., depression and anxiety, lack of interest, suicidal tendencies, social phobia, feelings of being worried and afraid, suffering, anger) and seven influential factors (i.e., interpersonal relationships, love, family, work, psychotherapy, personal characteristics, marriage) were found. The online PHS behaviors related to different psychological problems and influential factors remained a growing trend before 2020 and have been increasing significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Four main stages were found during the pandemic according to the changes in the online PHS population: sharp growth, significant decline, slight rebound, and slow decline. This study identified large-scale, spontaneous PHS behaviors among the online public during the COVID-19 pandemic and the various psychological problems and influential factors that varied across different stages of the pandemic, suggesting that the government and health practitioners should adopt effective policies and strategies to prevent and intervene in mental health problems for the online public.","Huang, Yinghui, Liu, Hui, Zhang, Lin, Li, Shen, Wang, Weijun, Ren, Zhihong, Zhou, Zongkui, Ma, Xueyao","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111525","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11525, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11525, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21711,""

"Changes in Mental Health and Views on Communication and Activities of Public Institutions among Swedes during the COVID-19 Pandemicâ€”A Cross-Sectional Repeated Measures Design","Although many studies have been conducted on the effects of COVID-19 on individual lives, only a few focus on the changes in mental health and views of public institutions during the pandemic. This study aimed to investigate how mental health, i.e., life satisfaction, worries, and psychological distress, and views on public institutionsâ€™ communication and activities have changed among Swedes during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether this was moderated by age and sex. In Aprilâ€“May 2020 (survey 1) and in Januaryâ€“February 2021 (survey 2), 2554 adults and 1904 newly recruited adults, respectively, anonymously completed online surveys. We found that life satisfaction and psychological distress did not change from survey 1 to survey 2. However, the level of worries increased, and the positive views of the public institutions decreased. Moreover, worries and psychological distress increased more in young adults than older adults. Finally, the change in the views of the public institutions was not related to the change in worries. Our results highlight the COVID-19 long-term impacts on individual mental health and call for the need for future research concerning the consequences for the population, especially among young adults. The results also indicate that the views on activities of public authorities decreased over time, especially among men. Given that loss of this trust can have vastly negative effects, for instance, on the vaccine campaign, it is important to monitor this trend, to increase awareness among Swedish authorities. The results also stress for institutions to provide adequate support both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in a future crisis.","Kerstis, Birgitta, Giannotta, Fabrizia, WÃ¥gert, Petra von Heideken, HellstrÃ¶m, Charlotta, Lindberg, Daniel, Stier, Jonas, ElvÃ©n, Maria","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111498","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1498, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1498, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21713,""
"Daily Behaviors, Worries and Emotions in Children and Adolescents with ADHD and Learning Difficulties during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the coronavirus crisis on behavioral and emotional parameters in children and adolescents with ADHD and Learning Difficulties. A total of 101 children, 5â€“18 years old, were included in the study, 63 (44 boys) of which were diagnosed with ADHD and learning difficulties (ADHD/LD) and 38 were healthy children (19 boys). The CRISIS questionnaire for parents/caregivers was used. The questionnaire was completed during the first national lockdown in Greece and the data referred to two time-points: 3 months before, and the past 2 weeks. A significant deterioration in the â€œEmotion/Worries (EW)â€ symptoms was observed during the pandemic in the control group (2.62 Â± 0.16 vs. 2.83 Â± 0.18, p &lt; 0.001). No such differences were noted in the ADHD group: 3.08 Â± 0.25 vs. 3.12 Â± 0.29, p = 0.12. Provision of educational and activities support was related to increased EW before the crisis. In ADHD/LD children, higher parental education and childâ€™s younger age were related to increased symptoms of EW. In the entire group, previous mental health conditions, increasing stress due to restrictions, and increased COVID-related worries were positively associated with the EW symptoms during the crisis. Less affected relations with friends and less reduction in contact with people outside the home were negatively related with EW during the crisis.

"Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Use and Suicide Risk: Hypotheses for Confluent Etiopathogenetic Mechanisms?","Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are classical anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory treatments, which were used as first-line therapy at the beginning of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Besides the emerging data on their lack of efficacy against COVID-19 infection, such treatments have been associated with some severe health concerns, including those of neuropsychiatric nature, such as a possible increase in suicide risk. Here we report a case of a patient with no history of psychiatric illnesses, who abruptly developed depression with melancholic features, severe suicidal ideation (SI), and attempted suicide (SA) shortly after receiving HCQ for his COVID-19 infection. The case was followed by a mini-review of the heterogeneous scientific literature on the hypothetical association between neuropsychiatric symptoms, with a focus on SI and suicidal behavior (SB, including SA and death by suicide), when CQ and HCQ are used in COVID-19, rheumatologic diseases, and malaria settings. Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of CQ and HCQ and the implications for neuroinflammation in suicide pathogenesis, the possible increase in suicide risk caused by these medications appears paradoxical and suggests that other underlying pathological trajectories might account for this eventuality. In this regard, some of these latter mechanistic postulates were proposed. Certainly the role and contribution of psycho-social factors that a COVID-19 patient had to face can neither be minimized nor excluded in the attempt to understand his suffering until the development of SI/SB. However, while this case report represents a rare scenario in clinical practice, no consensus exists in the literature on this topic, a psychiatric screening for suicide risk in patients using of CQ and HCQ could be carefully considered.","Costanza, Alessandra, Placenti, Valeria, Amerio, Andrea, Aguglia, Andrea, Serafini, Gianluca, Amore, Mario, Macchiarulo, Elena, Branca, Francesco, Merli, Roberto, Bondolfi, Guido, Nguyen, Khoa Dinh","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11110154","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 11(11):154, 2021.; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 11(11):154, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21715,""
"Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Mental Health Difficulties Result in a Reduced Quality of Life in the Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome","(1) Background: Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persisting symptoms up to 12 weeks after the acute illness, impairs numerous peopleâ€™s physical and mental health. (2) Methods: 64 inpatients and 79 outpatients, aged under 55 years, with post-acute COVID-19, were evaluated by a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), mental health examination, Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire, post-COVID-19 functional status scale (PCFS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). (3) Results: all inpatients had mild/moderate pulmonary injury during acute COVID-19, in contrast to 37.97% of outpatients. Inpatients who reported an average of 5 persisting symptoms, had, predominantly, level 3 PCFS and a median QoL of 62, compared to outpatients, who reported an average of 3 symptoms, level 1 PCFS and a median QoL score of 70. Increased pulmonary artery pressure was detected in 28.11% of inpatients, compared to 17.72% of outpatients, while diastolic dysfunction was diagnosed in 28.12% of inpatients, in comparison with 20.25% of outpatients (p = 0.02). Abnormal systolic function was assessed in 9.37% of inpatients, and 7.58% of outpatients. According to the HADS depression subscale, 46.87% of inpatients and 27.84% of outpatients had clinical depression. Concomitantly, anxiety was detected in 34.37% of inpatients and 40.5% of outpatients (4) Conclusions: cardiovascular and mental health difficulties were frequently detected in patients with post-acute symptoms of COVID-19, which correlated with the number and intensity of persisting symptoms and reduced QoL scores.","Giurgi-Oncu, Catalina, Tudoran, Cristina, Pop, Gheorghe Nicusor, Bredicean, Cristina, Pescariu, Silvius Alexandru, Giurgiuca, Ana, Tudoran, Mariana","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11111456","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1456, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1456, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21716,""
"Untold Stories of Moral Injury: What We Are Learning - And Not Learning - And Military Veterans in Transition","Despite increases in technical capacities for communication, contemporary society struggles with a persistent inability to effectively engage in collective action around a growing number of existential challenges manifesting in local, national, and global contexts. Confronted with environmental deterioration, economic disruptions, wars, and civil unrest, we are challenged to engage in coherent conversations that could lead to collective action, based on a shared understanding. Instead, we are enmeshed in polarized narratives, competing agendas, and emotional conflict. The uneven response to the global COVID-19 pandemic is but the most recent example of this lack of unity. As we seek to find our way in this increasingly complex social landscape, one of the best potential sources for learning about social systems and communication in conflict has gone largely unexamined. For nearly two decades, Military veterans of many nations have struggled while returning from wartime service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite best efforts to welcome these service members home and provide access to educational and health benefits, many of them report a difficulty in relating to fellow citizens and institutions upon their return. One indicator of this sense of alienation is the growing number of suicides among this population, now exceeding the number of casualties of combat service itself. Thwarted ability to communicate with others outside of the military and veterans community, and therefore participate in post-service social life, is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor for suicide. It has never been easy for military veterans to talk about combat experiences. However, the levels of social isolation we are seeing now points toward a deeper and more systemic issue that is not necessarily connected to specific experiences of combat trauma, but instead rooted in real or perceived cultural and moral misalignments associated with difficult experiences in both service and post-serve transition. The longer term effects of thwarted communication and social isolation of veterans, or the feeling of not fitting in can lead to further damage to the underlying moral structures, manifesting as moral conflict (Pearce and Littlejohn, 1997) or moral injuries (Shay, 2014). These moral injuries may include perceived personal failings or culpability based on specific combat experiences, or more generally, a sense of futility in the political limitations of military missions, or perceived betrayals of trust by those in authority. Additionally, stressors and misalignments in the transition process around homecoming are likely as much of a factor as combat experience in creating moral injuries. Many veterans point to a lack of shared values and principles among citizens, and within social institutions and media, as one reason for the difficulty of post-service reintegration. Moral injuries in this sense have further existential implications, with important (but often unheard) messages for our entire society. These are not simple issues that can be addressed by our current array of social work or clinical interventions, or by altering narratives and messages. Rather, they demand a full and interdisciplinary engagement in collective assessment and meaning-making at the society level. As a way of inviting communication scholars into this conversation, I present several models drawn from the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) Theory (Pearce, 2007) to look at the way that moral conflict and moral injuries are made or socially constructed in misaligned communication between returning service members and families, institutions, and others at both the population level and in community settings. Mental health implications are drawn Adlerian psychology, a body of psychological theory that is intersubjectively oriented, and shares a relational or social constructionist orientation with CMM. I then discuss the significance of these intersections in communication and mental health theory and practice, and implications for looking more closely a social connections and communication as key components of well-being and coherence.

"Clinical and Nutritional Implications of Kidney Disease and COVID-19","By the end of 2019 emerged a cluster of pneumonia that was caused by a novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. The disease, subsequently named COVID-19, has a wide range of signs and symptoms, including fever, respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, and kidney disease that can evolve to a nutritional imbalance through direct and indirect mechanisms. Moreover, the prognosis of COVID-19 could worsen in high-risk populations like kidney disease patients, given their depressed immunity and impaired nutritional state. Therefore, previous reports suggest prioritizing a nutritional approach in these patients, adjusting for individual dietary needs. Thus, we aim to explore the current knowledge about the clinical and nutritional implications of patients with COVID-19 who develop acute or chronic kidney disease, highlighting proposed dietary recommendations in this group of patients.","Vasquez, H.

"Repurposing approach of fluvoxamine for COVID-19","Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994 for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and is now used to treat a variety of psychiatric conditions, including social anxiety disorder and depression. In addition to its neurocognitive effects, fluvoxamine has been noted to have anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting it may have a role in the treatment of diseases beyond the realm of the central nervous system. Although fluvoxamine is not FDA-approved for the treatment of any infection, there is emerging evidence that the drug may improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This paper reviews the pleiotropic properties of fluvoxamine and looks ahead, to explore how the drug may be used to treat the inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19 in the future.","McCarthy, M.

"Does COVID-19 infection have an impact on childrenâ€™s psychological problems?","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a significant impact on children, adolescents, and their families. So, the purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of childrenâ€™s psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and their association of COVID-19 infection in children and their risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 148 children aged 6â€“12 years old categorized into 2 groups based on COVID-19 infection history. Participants were assessed by the Socioeconomic Scale and the Checklist for Childrenâ€™s Behavior (CBCL). Results: Children who had COVID-19 had a high percentage of problems regarding family, school, social, financial, and parent problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding CBCL, children who had COVID-19 infection had a higher percentage of clinical rating than the other group regarding withdrawal (11.1% vs. 8.9%), anxious/depressed (33.3% vs. 25%), somatic (11.1% vs. 10.7%), internalizing (61.1% vs. 48.2%), externalizing (38.9% vs. 35.7%), and total problems (50% vs. 44.6%). Family history of psychiatric disorder and the presence of three or more offspring were at high risk for internalizing problems, while those with school problems during pandemic were more vulnerable for internalizing and total problems. Conclusion: Children with COVID-19 infection had a higher risk of developing psychological problems, such as withdrawal, anxiety/depression, somatic, internalizing, externalizing, and total problems.

"Epidemic Control and Resource Allocation: Approaches and Implications for the Management of COVID-19","The experience with COVID-19 underscores a classic public policy choice problem: how should policymakers determine how to allocate constrained budgets, limited equipment, under-resourced hospitals and stretched personnel to limit the spread of the virus. This article presents an overview of the general literature on resource allocation in epidemics and assess how it informs our understanding of COVID-19. We highlight the peculiarities of the pandemic that call for a rethinking of existing approaches to resource allocation. In particular, we analyse how the experience of COVID-19 informs our understanding and modelling of the optimal resource allocation problem in epidemics. Our delineation of the literature focuses on resource constraint as the key variable. A qualitative appraisal indicates that the current suit of models for understanding the resource allocation problem requires adaptations to advance our management of COVID-19 or similar future epidemics. Particularly under-studied areas include issues of uncertainty, potential for co-epidemics, the role of global connectivity, and resource constrained problems arising from depressed economic activity. Incorporating various global dimensions of COVID-19 into resource allocation modelling such a centralized versus decentralized resource control and the role of geostrategic interests could yield crucial insights. This will require multi-disciplinary approaches to the resource allocation problem.JEL Classifications: I14, I18, E61, D60, H4, H12","Nyiwul, Linus","https://doi.org/10.1177/23210222211053751","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Studies in Microeconomics;: 23210222211053751, 2021.; Publication details: Studies in Microeconomics;: 23210222211053751, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21721,""
"First-Year University Studentsâ€™ Mental Health Trajectories Were Disrupted at the Onset of COVID-19, but Disruptions Were Not Linked to Housing and Financial Vulnerabilities: A Registered Report","This study modeled disruptions in first-year undergraduates? trajectories of mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, testing whether disruptions were worse for students who moved residences, reported low family income, or were food insecure. Participants (n = 510) at a large Canadian university reported depression, anxiety, and stress in September, November, January, and March. In March 2020, in tandem with COVID-related campus closures, students also reported for each mental health measure whether their responses were influenced by personal experiences surrounding the pandemic. As hypothesized, students who reported feeling more COVID-related disruption reported poorer mental health in March. Contrary to hypotheses, mental health disruptions were not more pronounced for students who moved, had low income, or were food insecure. Survey administration at an early stage of COVID-19 combined with supports afforded by moving in with parents and near-universal government income assistance may have mitigated the incremental distress we hypothesized for vulnerable students.","Howard, Andrea L.; Carnrite, Kendra D.; Barker, Erin T.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21676968211053523","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211053523, 2021.; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211053523, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21722,""
"From Therapy to Teletherapy: Relocating Mental Health Services Online","Numerous studies have highlighted a range of potential benefits of teletherapy for clients. Nonetheless, researchers have found that many therapists are reluctant to adopt teletherapy in their work practice. There is a dearth of research about how therapists have appropriated telehealth platforms, either to understand teletherapy practice or to understand the challenges and opportunities for system design. The COVID-19 pandemic offers an unfortunate but unique opportunity to learn more about the experiences of therapists who use a range of therapeutic interventions with a range of client populations. In this work, we explore the following research question: in what ways do telehealth platforms support and challenge the work of teletherapy? We present results of semi-structured interviews conducted with 14 mental health therapists during the first six months of the pandemic in the United States. We present a descriptive account of their experiences as well as a discussion of the ways in which the multi-layered and interdependent nature of two facets of therapeutic work - -the therapeutic alliance and the therapeutic interventions - -made the transition to computer-supported cooperative work particularly challenging. We then offer a suite of design implications for systems that better support the nuanced and unique work of teletherapy.

"A Survey-based qualitative study to characterize expectations of software developers from five stakeholders","Background. Studies on developer productivity and well-being find that the perceptions of productivity in a software team can be a socio-Technical problem. Intuitively, problems and challenges can be better handled by managing expectations in software teams. Aim. Our goal is to understand whether the expectations of software developers vary towards diverse stakeholders in software teams. Method. We surveyed 181 professional software developers to understand their expectations from five different stakeholders: (1) organizations, (2) managers, (3) peers, (4) new hires, and (5) government and educational institutions. The five stakeholders are determined by conducting semi-formal interviews of software developers. We ask open-ended survey questions and analyze the responses using open coding. Results. We observed 18 multi-faceted expectations types. While some expectations are more specific to a stakeholder, other expectations are cross-cutting. For example, developers expect work-benefits from their organizations, but expect the adoption of standard software engineering (SE) practices from their organizations, peers, and new hires. Conclusion. Out of the 18 categories, three categories are related to career growth. This observation supports previous research that happiness cannot be assured by simply offering more money or a promotion. Among the most number of responses, we find expectations from educational institutions to offer relevant teaching and from governments to improve job stability, which indicate the increasingly important roles of these organizations to help software developers. This observation can be especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. Â© 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

"Piloting modified cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in a community mental health team (CMHT)","IntroductionCognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the first line therapy for insomnia, a common risk factor in psychiatry. We investigated whether piloting a CBT-I programme within a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) improves insomnia symptoms. Our programme consisted mainly of Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) determined by individual chronotypes. CBT-I is currently under-resourced in the UK. To our knowledge, this was the first NHS programme in Bristol secondary mental health.Methods10 participants were recruited. Participants underwent a therapist guided initiation on (a) Sleep education (b) Sleep hygiene (c) Stimulus Control. Individual sleep windows were determined by the participantsâ€™ chronotype: whether they were a â€˜morning larkâ€™ or â€˜evening owlâ€™. Participants then underwent a 6-week course of Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT). Weekly follow up focussed around motivation and explanation was either by phone or face-to-face due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome measurements used pre- and post-intervention sleep diaries;as well as insomnia, depression (PHQ-9) and general health questionnaires (SF-36).ResultsThere was little improvement in Total Sleep Time (TST) (d= -0.84 hours) and patient-reported sleep quality (d= -0.67) following a 6-week course of modified CBT-I. Despite this, average number of mid-sleep awakenings roughly halved (47.9%). ISI, PHQ-9 and SF-36 questionnaires demonstrated no difference between pre-intervention and post-intervention scores. Unstructured interviews revealed that patientsâ€™ thoughts and anxieties at night-time interfered with SRT.ConclusionsOur study suggests that modified CBT-I is a challenge for mental health populations. Solely SRT may not be sufficient to treat insomnia secondary to mental illness. Treating co-morbid insomnia may therefore require multi-component CBT-I to address sleep-related mental health issues, such as panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares. CBT-I in secondary mental health services requires further development, with long-term follow up of patients to evaluate adherence to the programme and the behavioural changes needed.","Mandagere, Vinay, Whishart, Phoebe, Hicks, Jane","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-bssconf.22","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open Respiratory Research; 8(Suppl 1):A13, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Open Respiratory Research; 8(Suppl 1):A13, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21726,""
"Preparing social workers to address health inequities emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic by building capacity for health policy: a scoping review protocol","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought tremendous changes in healthcare delivery and exacerbated a wide range of inequities. Social workers across a broad range of healthcare settings bring an expertise in social, behavioural and mental healthcare needed to help address these health inequities. In addition, social workers integrate policy-directed interventions and solutions in clinical practice, which is a needed perspective for recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains unclear, however, what the most pressing policy issues are that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, many social workers in health settings tend to underuse policy in their direct practice. The objectives of this scoping review are to: (1) systematically scope the literature on social work, COVID-19 pandemic and policy;and (2) describe the competencies required by social workers and the social work profession to address the policy issues emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review follows Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework. Identification of literature published between 1 December 2019 and the search date, 31 March 2021, will take place in two stages: (1) title and abstract review, and (2) full-text review. In partnership with a health science librarian, the research team listed keywords related to social work and policy to search databases including Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Social Services Abstract and Social Work Abstracts. Two graduate-level research assistants will conduct screening and full-text review. Data will then be extracted, charted, analysed and summarised to report on our results and implications on practice, policy and future research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results will help develop a policy practice competence framework to inform how social workers can influence policy. We will share our findings through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

"Oxford Understanding Relationships, Sex, Power, Abuse and Consent Experiences (OUR SPACE) cross-sectional survey: a study protocol","IntroductionSexual violence among higher education students is a public health concern, threatening the general safety of students, often with significant physical and mental health implications for victims. Establishing the prevalence estimates of sexual violence at higher education institutions (HEIs) is essential for designing and resourcing responses to sexual violence, including monitoring the effectiveness of prevention initiatives and institutional programmes. Yet, to date, there have been no rigorous studies assessing prevalence of sexual violence at HEIs in the UK.Methods and analysisInformed by guidance from Universities UK, the University of Oxford administration and the related student advocacy groups working within the University, Oxford Understanding Relationships, Sex, Power, Abuse and Consent Experiences is a cross-sectional survey of all undergraduate and graduate students over the age of 18 enrolled at the University of Oxford, UK. The survey design uses a complete sampling approach and measures adapted from previous campus climate surveys in the USA as well as the Sexual Experiences Survey (USA).

"Government ministers not wearing masks was bad enough, but their defence of this position is even worse","To the extent that it leads to a sense of â€œone law for them and another law for us,â€ this inconsistency not only undermines the specific behaviour in question (whether that be wearing masks or respecting lockdown rules), but also undermines the influence of and trust in the government in general.5 One of the most basic findings of group psychology is that we are less likely to trust or be influenced by someone who is seen as outgroup than where the same person is seen as ingroup.6 And so once the government act in ways that lead to them being perceived as outgroup, their ability to influence us declines. In our own work, we have examined some basic manifestations of this principle: we stand closer to ingroup members than outgroup members, we are less disgusted by their bodily excretions and odours, we are more likely to share food and drink.789 While this within-group trust is very important in terms of facilitating group cohesion, solidarity, and cooperation (which themselves can improve both physical and mental health), it can also have seriously negative consequences in terms of infection transmission.10 In past pandemics, this has proved to be a key issue. At the height of AIDS epidemic, for instance, people were less likely to use condoms with more familiar partners because they assumed them to be â€œcleanerâ€ and unlikely to be infected. [...]linked to this, they found it difficult to find ways of asking such partners to wear condoms insofar as this implied that the partner was dirty physically and/or morally.11 During the current pandemic, we have pointed to the significance of these processes in various waysâ€”for instance the dangers of hospital staff forgetting social distancing and mask wearing protocols when entering the familiar confines of the workplace and specific â€œingroupâ€ spaces such as common rooms.12 We have also stressed their significance in the opening of mass events, such as football matches, where attendees are likely to have strong ingroup ties to others.

"USE OF TELEMEDICINE FOR FOLLOW-UP OF SLE PATIENTS WITH NEPHRITIS IN THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK (â€œTeleSLEâ€): THE 6-MONTH RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL","Background:Patients with lupus nephritis (LN) might be more susceptible to COVID-19 due to the underlying disease, co-morbidities and use of immunosuppressants. We hypothesized that telemedicine (TM) could be a well-accepted mode of health-care delivery minimizing the risk of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while maintaining disease control in these patients.Objectives:To evaluate the short-term patient satisfaction, compliance, disease control and infection risk of TM compared with standard in-person follow-up (FU) for patients with LN during COVID-19.Methods:This was a single-center randomized-controlled study. Consecutive patients followed at the LN clinic were randomized to either TM (TM group) or standard FU (SF group) in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the TM group received scheduled follow-ups via videoconferencing. SF group patients continued conventional in-person outpatient care. The 6-month data were compared.Results:From June to December 2020, 122 patients were randomized (TM: 60, SF: 62) and had attended at least 2 FU visits. There were no baseline differences, including SLEDAI-2k and proportion of patients in lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS), between the 2 groups except a higher physician global assessment score (PGA) in the TM group (mean 0.67Â±0.69 vs 0.45Â±0.60, p=0.003) (Table 1). The mean FU duration was 19.8Â±4.5 weeks. When comparing the most recent visit, the mean waiting time between entering the clinic waiting room (virtual or real) and seeing a rheumatologist (virtual or in-person) was significantly shorter in the TM group (22.5Â±28.6 vs 68.9Â±40.7 minutes, p&lt; 0.001) (Figure 1A). The mean overall patient satisfaction score was higher in the TM group (mean 2.19Â±0.61 vs 1.89Â±0.78, p=0.042). The results of the post-consultation satisfaction questionnaire are shown in Figure 1B. The number of visits was similar in the two groups (TM: 3.1Â±1.3 vs SF: 3.0Â±1.2, p=0.981). However, there was a trend suggesting that alternative mode of FU was requested more frequently in the TM group than the SF group (TM: 12/60, 20.0% and SF: 5/62, 8.1%;p=0.057). More patients in the TM group had hospitalization (15/60, 25.0% vs 7/62, 11.3%;p=0.049) within the FU period, which was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for the baseline PGA. The proportions of patients remained in LLDAS were similar in the 2 groups (TM: 75.0% vs SF: 74.2%, p=0.919). None of the patients had COVID-19.Conclusion:TM resulted in better patient satisfaction and could achieve similar disease control in patients with LN in the short-term when compared to standard care.Table 1.Baseline clinical data of the recruited patients and comparison between the telemedicine/standard follow-up groupsOverall (n=122)Telemedicine group (n=60)Standard follow-up group (n=62)P-valueAge in years44.4Â±11.544.1Â±11.744.7Â±11.50.779Gender: Female111 (91.0)55 (91.7)56 (90.3)0.796Disease duration in years15.1Â±9.016.2Â±8.714.0Â±9.10.115Nephritis class III, IV or V108 (88.5)54 (90.0)54 (87.1)0.42724 hour urine proteinuria in gram0.51Â±0.630.53Â±0.600.50Â±0.650.712Current use of prednisolone112 (91.8)57 (95.0)55 (88.7)0.323Daily prednisolone dose in mg5.51Â±4.215.69Â±4.175.34Â±4.290.570Use of immunosuppressant90 (73.8)46 (76.7)44 (71.0)0.474SLEDAI-2K3.65Â±2.334.00Â±2.343.30Â±2.290.097PGA0.56Â±0.650.67Â±0.690.45Â±0.600.003LLDAS78 (63.9)36 (60.0)42(67.7)0.251Remission0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)n/aPresence of comorbidity87 (71.3)40 (66.7)47 (75.8)0.264SDI0.93Â±1.151.08Â±1.280.78Â±0.980.243HAQ-DI0.23Â±0.460.25Â±0.470.21Â±0.440.571HADS: Anxiety scale Depression scale6.07Â±4.12 5.72Â±4.316.20Â±4.19 5.73Â±3.935.93Â±4.09 5.70Â±4.680.720 0.724Data are reported as mean Â± SD or number (%).

"School-age adopted children's early responses to remote schooling during COVID-19","Abstract Objective This mixed-methods exploratory study sought to address the experiences of 89 adoptive parents (heterosexual, lesbian, and gay) in the United States with school-age children in relation to the transition to remote schooling and their children's mental health during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Background The transition to remote schooling and associated confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for families, particularly when children are struggling with mental health and learning challenges. Methods Data were collected via an online survey between May and June 2020. Before the pandemic, almost half of the children received special education services. Results Findings revealed that although a minority of children were doing well with remote schooling, the majority were struggling due to lack of motivation and an inability to work independently. Some parents voiced challenges with teacher communication and inconsistencies across classes and were overwhelmed by the demands of their new role as proctor/teacher. Some were dissatisfied with how children's school services had been implemented and noted difficulties with the online format of various services (e.g., therapy was less engaging). Regarding children's mental health, half of parents said it had stayed the same, one third said it had worsened, and the remainder said it had improved. The mental health of children adopted via foster care seemed to have benefited from the additional time spent at home. Yet most children were described as struggling in part due to social isolation and loss of routine, which manifested in a variety of ways, including anxiety, schoolwork avoidance, and boundary testing. Most parents tried to show patience, tolerance, and reassurance, but more than one third reported stress and frustration associated with not knowing how to best support their children. Conclusion The transition to remote schooling during COVID-19 may be especially challenging for adoptive families and other families whose children have higher levels of need. Implications Findings have implications for parents, teachers, school social workers and psychologists, and other professionals who work with children and families.","Goldberg, Abbie E.; McCormick, Nora, Virginia, Haylie","https://doi.org/10.1111/fare.12612","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Family Relations; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Family Relations; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21731,""
"Coping Mechanism of Students below Poverty Line towards Continuous Education amidst Covid 19 Pandemic","During the Covid-19 Pandemic, the State Universities, Colleges and Stakeholders are one of the most affected institutions towards continuous education. Students below poverty line are one of the most affected in terms of continuing education. This phenomenal problem leads to a mental health issues like stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies. The objective of this study was to identify the coping mechanism of students below poverty line towards continuous education. The impact of the study was determined on how students alleviated all the adversity they had been encountered, and how they used their effective coping skills to helped improved their mental and emotional well-being during the traumatic situations amidst Covid-19, Pandemic. The study was focused on the students that were identified as below poverty line. This study has significance to the School Administration in formulating strategic plan that would beneficial to all the stakeholders. The researcher gathered data from the students considered as below poverty line and used a mixed-method, the quantitative and, qualitative approach. The researcher used a poll survey through Facebook page that determined the frequency of the internet connection in the entire barangays in San Fernando, Romblon. The data and information was gathered from one hundred students. The Poll survey was composed of two categories: first, for the students who used Pocket Wi-fi or broadband, and second, for the students used Mobile Data Connection. Based on the internet connectivity using mobile data connection and Wi-Fi connection, the results was moderate internet connection. Most of the students belongs to the below poverty line were the students experienced and encountered difficulties toward continuous education by the manner of flexible and blended learning. In students self-learning assessment in coping mechanism, the result revealed that students don't have enough tools and equipment for their studies. The result of the statistical was been discussed to the School Administration on creating the policies, standards, and guidelines. The Coping Mechanism Identified was adaptive behavioral such as helping, assisting and engaging in problem solving. Â© 2021 IEEE.","Anayan, N. Q.; Penuela, V.

"Medical Students' Attitude towards Online Learning","The onset of pandemic (Covid-19) brought schools to a nonface-to-face learning protocol and introduced Online Learning (OL) to continue the education among students. To determine how students perceive OL in their learning, this study was conducted. This descriptive quantitative research involved the 3rd year medical students ($\mathrm{n}=117$) enrolled in Pathologic Obstetric course, AY2020-2021, who voluntarily confirmed as participants of the study. The main research instrument of this study employed the questionnaire on the Students' Attitude on Online Learning. The data obtained from this questionnaire was analyzed using the descriptive statistics through SPSS version 20. Results showed that the respondents generally agree that online learning is capable of increasing the student's interest in computers and learning. However, they think that the less face-to-face interaction might not promote social interaction and slow internet connection can significantly make online learning difficult. It was also found out that students generally disagree to the effectiveness of online learning because it is not practically economical and time-consuming, results to weak student-teacher interaction that threatens the quality of teaching-learning process in addition to its inability to ensure effectiveness of classroom work presentation. In terms of the ease in using online learning, it is observed that students in general had a negative attitude on this emphasizing that there should have been another form of learning implemented other than through computers. There is no significant difference in the attitude of the male and female respondents to online learning, except in the ability of online learning to be discouraging having slow computer and/or slow internet connection and online learning's ability to make student's become slaves to technology. These results will provide insights to educators and school administrations to introduce and implement a more visible and achievable blended learning approach, than the usual pure online learning approach.

"Students's Perceptions and Anxieties towards e-Assessment: Implications for Online Classroom Delivery","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth numerous new challenges for all afflicted as well as exposed the weaknesses of the current educational system. The public education in the Philippines had to overhaul its system to ensure quality and to provide accessible education to all students. Varying strategies have emerged to deliver relevant Online Classroom Delivery (OCD). The utilization of e-Assessment was sought after to generate real-time feedback to facilitate and monitor the students' progress. This research aimed to determine the students' perceptions and anxieties with OCD embedded e-Assessment, and the challenges encountered in an OCD. A cross-sectional survey was employed to determine the students' perceptions and anxieties. The results revealed the perceived threats and the remarkable anxiety levels of the students caused by the pandemic. This supports the information that the students' perception of using e-Assessment is positively correlated with their levels of anxiety. Challenges attributed to the perceived threats and anxiety included the availability of the technology, the presence or absence of internet connection, mobilization of software and related technology, appropriateness of e-Assessment strategy whether to be given as (diagnostic, formative or summative), teachers' adeptness, and familiarity towards the innovation of educational technology. Accordingly, this paper recommends the strengthening of research efforts in relation to the factors that increase students' level of anxiety in OCD, incorporation of accessible and easy-to-use mental health services, and computer training for both teachers and students.

"Green tea might be effective in alleviating COVID-19 associated psychiatric complications: preliminary results from a pilot randomized controlled trial","Purpose: It is argued that COVID-19 patients show various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including fatigue, depression and anxiety. On the other hand, epidemiological and experimental evidence indicated that green tea could potentially have antiviral effects and ameliorate psychiatric disorders. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether drinking green tea can clinically improve psychiatric complications of COVID-19 infection. Design/methodology/approach: This study included 40 patients with laboratory confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disorder in the current randomized open-label controlled trial. Patients were instructed to include three cups/day of green tea (intervention) or black tea (control) to their usual diet for four weeks immediately after diagnosis of the disease. At the study baseline and after the intervention, the enrolled patientsâ€™ fatigue, depression and anxiety were assessed by the Chalder Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires. Findings: A total of 19 COVID-19 cases in the intervention group (mean age = 52 years) and 14 cases (mean age = 50 years) in the control group completed the study. Analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline levels, and confounders revealed that those who consumed three cups/day of green tea compared to the patients who received black tea experienced significantly lower fatigue, depression and state and trait anxiety levels (adjusted means for fatigue = 12.3 vs 16.2 (P = 0.03), depression = 0.53 vs 1.8 (P = 0.01), 37.4 vs 45.5 (P &lt; 0.01) and 37.9 vs 45.2 (P &lt; 0.01)). Research limitations/implications: The open-label design may bias the evaluation of the self-reported status of fatigue, depression or anxiety as the main outcomes assessed. Moreover, as this study did not include patients with severe COVID-19, this might affect the generalizability of the present results. Thus, the recommendation of daily drinking green tea may be limited to the subjects diagnosed with mild-to-moderate type of infection or those with long-term neuropsychiatric complications owing to COVID-19. Besides, considering the ethical issues, this study could not exclude the drug therapyâ€™s confounding effects;thereby, this point should be considered when interpreting the current results. Besides, it is worth noting that Guilan province in the north of Iran is recognized as a tea (and particularly green tea) producing region;thereby, it is an available and relatively inexpensive product. Considering this issue, the recommendation to consume this medicinal plant in adjunct to the routine treatment approach among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 based on its beneficial effects may be widely accepted. Practical implications: Green tea consumption could be considered an option to combat COVID-19 associated psychological complications, including fatigue, depression and anxiety among patients suffering from mild-to-moderate type of this viral infection. Originality/value: To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, in this study, for the first time, the effects of green tea compared to black tea on COVID-19 associated fatigue, depression and anxiety status within an open-label controlled trial have been investigated.

"Understanding misinformation and rumors that generated panic buying as a social practice during COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from Twitter, YouTube and focus group interviews","Purpose: The purpose of the study is to understand how socially shared misinformation and rumors can enhance the motivation to protect personal interests and enhance social practices of panic buying. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a number of qualitative data collection methods for the purpose of triangulation, as it can offer thick interpretation and can help to develop a context specific research framework. Findings: The shared misinformation and rumors on social media developed into psychological, physical and social threats;therefore, people started panic buying to avoid these negative consequences. People believed that there were differences between the information shared by politicians and government officials and reality, such as â€œeverything is under control,â€ whereas social media showed people standing in long queues and struggling to buy the necessities of life. The shared misinformation and rumors on social media became viral and received social validation, which created panic buying in many countries. Research limitations/implications: It is the responsibility of government, politicians, leaders, media and the public to control misinformation and rumors, as many people were unable to buy groceries due either to socio-economic status or their decisions of late buying, which increased depression among people. Originality/value: The study merged the theory of rumor (TORT) transmission and protection motivation theory (PMT) to understand how misinformation and rumors shared through social media increased global uncertainty and the desire to panic buy across the world.

"Business model adaptation as a strategic response to crises: navigating the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose: This study aims to explore how hotels adapt their business models as a strategic response to crisis situations. It sheds light on the processes and methods of business model adaptation during severe crisis situations, such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Design/methodology/approach: A single-case study was conducted. Data were collected from the owner/manager of a boutique hotel chain in Chiang Mai, Thailand through an extensive interviewing process. The authors also examined corporate documents. The authors then re-organized the material as a coherent narrative about how the company navigated the COVID-19 crisis. Findings: The findings show that the hotels in the study adapted their business models by cutting costs through stopping non-essential operations, increasing non-room revenues and adding new revenue channels, bringing in cash from advance bookings, securing financial support from creditors, leveraging government support and training staff for the â€œnew normal.â€ Originality/value: Few previous studies have focused on business model adaptation during the COVID-19 crisis. The investigation of this largely neglected area provides two main contributions. First, it extends the literature on crisis management in hospitality firms by examining business model adaptation patterns and processes during unprecedented crisis conditions.

"Factors affecting perception of Indian adolescent students toward interactive online mental health information during COVID-19","Purpose: This study aims to identify the critical factors affecting the perception of adolescent students toward interactive online mental health information available on health-related websites. Design/methodology/approach: The primary data was collected with the help of an online selfâ€“structured questionnaire. The questionnaire includes the identified variables extracted from previous literature related to the mental health information websites using the Likert scale. The respondents include the adolescent school students belonging to the northern region of India: semi-urban/rural locations of Uttar Pradesh (Agra and Mathura) and urban cities (Faridabad, Gaziabad, Delhi and NCR). The criteria for selecting respondents were that students must have visited any online health information-related websites at least once. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the factors with the help of SPSS.20. Findings: The identified factors that include information delivery medium/mode, websitesâ€™ navigation structure, customized information or content, ability to form a virtual relationship and supplementary features of the websites may benefit the health communication system of any country and the health-care industry. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations such as a limited number of respondents and even on that sample was taken for teenagers;thereby creating fewer generalizations related to the present context. Further, only exploratory factor analysis is applied in the study to identify the factors but future researchers may proceed to develop the conceptual model of perception toward online information with the help of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques. Practical implications: The results of this study are useful for government officials especially those related to the ministry of health care and public health organizations of various countries, who usually invest in co-designing authentic, reliable and high interactive online information-sharing websites. Social implications: The results of this study are helpful for government officials, especially those related to the ministry of health care and public health organizations of various countries, who usually invest in co-designing authentic, reliable and high interactive online information-sharing websites. Originality/value: The study is unique as it provides insight into the opinion of the adolescent students, primarily upon encountering the online mental health information concerning the Indian perspective. Future researchers, health-care policymakers and health-care professionals may use the study to capture a complete picture of a relevant phenomenon in their work.

"It Is Me, Chatbot: Working to Address the COVID-19 Outbreak-Related Mental Health Issues in China User Experience, Satisfaction, and Influencing Factors","The global spread of COVID-19 has caused a huge number of confirmed cases and deaths, which in return leads to a plethora of mental disorders across the world. In order to address citizensâ€™ psychological problems, government agencies in many countries have employed AI-based chatbots to provide mental health services. However, there is a limited understanding of the determinants affecting citizensâ€™ user experience and user satisfaction when mental health services supported by chatbots are provided. Thus, based on the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV), this study proposes an analytical framework to investigate the factors that are important to citizensâ€™ user experience and user satisfaction when they interact with mental health chatbots. Analysis of data collected from 295 chatbot users in Wuhan and Chongqing reveals that personalization, enjoyment, learning, and condition are positively related to user experience and user satisfaction. However, voice interaction fails to devote to citizensâ€™ user experience and user satisfaction. Thus, government agencies and their AI service contractors should enhance the functions and systems of mental health chatbots to ensure citizensâ€™ user experience and user satisfaction. Also, they should more positively promote the use of mental health chatbots during the public health emergency.

"Frontline yet at the back of the queue - Improving access and adaptations to CBT for Black African and Caribbean communities","This paper focuses on the Black minority ethnic population (Black British, Black African, Black Caribbean) and uses the term BME in reference to this group. Only 6.2% of BME people access psychological intervention for common mental disorders. In provision of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) the diversity in global majority populations 1 requires culturally specific informed and responsive approaches. The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme needs to be accountable, culturally congruent and strategic, to ensure accessibility and improve outcomes for BME people. According to the Mental Health Foundation (2019), a higher percentage of Black, Asian and other minority ethnic populations (BAME) are diagnosed with common, severe and complex mental health disorders. Despite the weight of literature on this, little has changed. The NHS Implementation Plan outlines trajectories for increased access and reduced attrition within mental health services, addressing inequalities for BAME populations. Evidence-based guidance and audits for provision of culturally sensitive and adapted therapies are presented in the pioneering (IAPT) BAME Positive Practice Guide (PPG). However, there are no funding arrangements or formal integrated frameworks to support implementation. The COVID-19 global pandemic and the high-profile death of George Floyd tragically exposed and highlighted the consequences of systemic racism. Understanding of the importance of service and clinical anti-racist practice is imperative for CBT therapists. Implementation of the BAME PPG audit tool ensures review of race equity in access, engagement, adaptation and workforce within IAPT and other mental health services. This could transform lives. Key learning aims (1) To understand the barriers (individual, societal and systemic) to accessing psychological therapies such as CBT and the impact on CBT treatment outcomes specifically for black minority ethnic (BME) populations. (2) To recognise barriers to implementation of formal frameworks for equitable access to psychological therapies such as CBT for BME communities. (3) To assist services and therapists to implement evidence-based learning, on cultural adaptations, to address barriers in access, retention and completion of CBT. (4) To provide examples of services that have taken successful actions to address the issues identified in the earlier points.

"Depression, Anxiety and Suicidal Behaviour Among College Students: Comparisons Pre-COVID-19 and During the Pandemic","Background Many students struggle with psychological problems during their college years. These problems may be even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic with the accompanying restrictions and transition to an online learning environment, but few longitudinal studies have been conducted to date. The aim of this study was to compare symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidality prior to and during the pandemic, and identify stressors. Methods This study was conducted among students attending Ulster University, Northern Ireland (NI) and LYIT, Republic of Ireland (ROI), as part of the World Mental Health International College Student Initiative (WMH-ICS). Data was collected from first year students in September 2019. The completed response rate was 25.22% (NI) and 41.9% (ROI) in relation to the number of first-year students registered. A follow up study was conducted in Autumn 2020, with 884 students fully completing the online survey in both years, equating to just under half of those who completed initially. Results High levels of mental health problems were found in year 1, especially in the ROI. Levels of depression increased significantly in year 2, particularly among students in NI, however, levels of anxiety decreased. No significant variations were found for suicidal behaviour. Several stressors were revealed, including increased social isolation, and worrying about loved ones. Limitations The findings may not be generalised to other student populations. Conclusions This study reveals variation in symptoms of depression and anxiety since the onset of the pandemic. In particular, the large increase in students with depression is of concern.","McLafferty, Margaret, Brown, Natasha, McHugh, Rachel, Ward, Caoimhe, Stevenson, Ailis, McBride, Louise, Brady, John, Bjourson, Anthony J.; Oâ€™Neill, Siobhan M.; Walsh, Colum P.; Murray, Elaine K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2021.100012","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Communications;: 100012, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Communications;: 100012, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21745,""
"â€œNo home to take methadone toâ€: Experiences with addiction services during the COVID-19 pandemic among survivors of opioid overdose in Boston","Introduction We conducted a qualitative study to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on experiences with addiction treatment and harm reduction services. Methods The study recruited participants from Boston, Massachusetts, aged 18â€“65 who had a history of opioid use disorder and overdose, from a parent study (REpeated dose Behavioral intervention to reduce Opioid Overdose, REBOOT) to participate between August and October 2020. In-depth individual interviews explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on addiction service experiences. We conducted a grounded content analysis that examined codes related to addiction service access and engagement during the pandemic to compare and categorize participants according to their experiences. Results The study enrolled twenty participants. The mean age was 42Â years;most identified as white (nÂ =Â 16);ten participants identified as men, nine as cis-gender women, and one as a trans-gender woman. Participants described their experiences with COVID-19-driven changes to addiction care (methadone take homes, televisits for either buprenorphine or behavioral health services, and syringe service outreach) access and engagement as: 1) liberating (nÂ =Â 7), 2) destabilizing (nÂ =Â 8), or 3) unjust (nÂ =Â 5). Participants in the liberating group found adaptations allowed for increased flexibility, freedom, and safety from COVID-19. This group was mostly housed and had strong social supports that facilitated participation in adapted treatment programs. COVID-19-related changes to addiction treatment disrupted routine and community supports among those in the destabilizing group. Participants in the unjust group felt that adaptations exacerbated inequities as a lack of housing and other social supports prohibited them from benefiting from the relaxed restrictions to methadone or buprenorphine. This group was mostly unhoused and found that adaptations did not adequately mitigate other inequities worsened by public health mandates for unhoused people who use drugs. Conclusion Relaxed restrictions on medications for opioid use disorder created opportunities for improved patient-centered care. Concrete measures that address service barriers, such as phone or transportation access, may have reduced destabilizing and unjust experiences reported by our participants. However, addiction care inequities will persist if drivers of marginalization, specifically a lack of housing, remain unaddressed.","Harris, Miriam T.

"â€œThe better you feel, the harder you fallâ€: Health perception biases and mental health among Chinese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The health risks of the current COVID-19 pandemic, together with the drastic mitigation measures taken in many affected nations, pose an obvious threat to public mental health. The social science literature has already established a clear link between mental health and sociodemographic as well as economic factors;at the same time, a growing number of studies investigate the role of biased risk perceptions. To assess this role in the context of COVID-19, this study first implements survey-based measures of health perception biases among Chinese adults during the pandemic. Then, it analyzes their relation to three mental health outcomes: life satisfaction, happiness, and depression (as measured by the CESÂ -Â D). We show that the health overconfidence displayed by approximately 30% of the survey respondents is a clear risk factor for mental health problems;it is a statistically significant predictor of depression and low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. We also document that these effects are stronger in regions that experienced higher numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results also offer clear guidelines for the implementation of effective interventions to temper health overconfidence, particularly in uncontrollable situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nie, Peng, Wang, Lu, Dragone, Davide, Lu, Haiyang, Sousa-Poza, Alfonso, Ziebarth, Nicolas R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2021.101708","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: China Economic Review;: 101708, 2021.; Publication details: China Economic Review;: 101708, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21747,""
"Parenting Practices, Stressors and Parental Concerns during COVID-19 in Pakistan","Background COVID-19 is a global crisis that has added fear, uncertainty, and stress to parents. Parents are going through several challenges related to school closure, financial insecurity and working remotely. These stressors are affecting the mental health of parents. Objectives This study aimed to observe major stressors along with the impact of COVID-19 on parental concerns and practices during lockdown. Participants Sample (N=923) was selected through purposive sampling from parents attending Out Patients Departments of hospitals in three provincial capital cities of Pakistan having a high burden of COVID-19, i.e. Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar. Parents having at least one child younger than 18 years were included in the study. Methods A quantitative design was used using a COVID-19 Parenting Response Scale (a = 0.74). It was used as a self-administered tool for parents who knew how to read and write Urdu/English language, however it was conducted as a structured interview for those who could not read/write. Data was analyzed by applying descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, percentage), independent sample t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. Results Findings of the current study showed several stressful factors for parents during COVID-19 pandemic, mainly financial burden, childrenâ€™s education, uncertainty of the situation, and many others. The study also suggests an association of parental concerns during COVID-19 with parenting practices. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic presents a global crisis not only of the health of the people but also on family relations and mental well-being. Findings of this research indicate the need for targeted and accessible interventions for mental health of parents especially during these challenging circumstances so that they can cope with the challenges in an effective way and be able to take care of their children better.","Zafar, Naeem, Naeem, Mehek, Zehra, Andleeb, Muhammad, Tufail, Sarfraz, Muhammad, Hamid, Haroon, Enam, Kishwar, Moaz, Muhammad, Shah, Bawar, Ishaque, Sidra, Muhammad, Nazir","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105393","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Child Abuse & Neglect;: 105393, 2021.; Publication details: Child Abuse & Neglect;: 105393, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21748,""

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on emergency department healthcare workers in a tertiary care center during a national economic crisis","Background Since the declaration of the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) and staff in the Emergency Departments (ED) started experiencing feelings of anxiety and fear from the projected exponential spread and the potential burden on the healthcare system and infrastructure. In Lebanon, major local factors contributing to this fear were the rapid escalation of COVID-19 cases across the country, the lack of preparedness, and the shortage of personal protective equipment, in addition to the evolving economic crisis and financial restrictions. This study aims to investigate the immediate psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on ED staff working in a hospital environment in relation to their household income. Methods Self-reported cross-sectional survey was delivered to the frontline staff working at the Department of Emergency Medicine of AUBMC in Beirut, Lebanon. General demographic characteristics, scores of Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), scores of Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and scores of Burnout Measure-Short (BMS) version were collected. Results 74 HCWs (49.6%) participated in the study. The mean age for participants was (31.78Â Â±Â 9.49). More than half of the participants were nurses and more than 70% reported a monthly salary of less than 2000 USD. The household income was negatively associated with the participant's scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, but not the BMS. Previous mental health diagnosis was positively associated with the PHQ-9 and BMS scores, while seeking mental health care was negatively associated with the PHQ-9 and BMS scores. Conclusion At our tertiary care center in a low-income, low resource country amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the HCWs reported marked psychological disturbances on different scales. In particular, the financial burden was associated with increased anxiety and clinical depression, but was not associated with burnout.","Al Hariri, Moustafa, Hamade, Bachar, Bizri, Maya, Salman, Oday, Tamim, Hani, Al Jalbout, Nour","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.10.055","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The American Journal of Emergency Medicine;2021.; Publication details: The American Journal of Emergency Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21750,""
"Should doctors use or avoid medical terms? The influence of medical terms on service quality of E-health","With epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19, many offline healthcare services have been suspended and shifted to online, where patients and doctors typically communicate by typing texts. The limited communication poses a threat to the service quality of E-health, and also raises higher demand on the language skills of doctors, in which medical terms are a common concern. Traditional studies of offline healthcare mostly hold a negative attitude towards the use of medical terms by doctors. However, should we still advise doctors to avoid using medical terms in E-health? To answer this question, this paper conducts a study combining technical and empirical analyses based on real data. In this paper, a novel unsupervised text-mining method is proposed to automatically identify medical terms with crowd wisdom from large-scale doctor-patient communication texts. Then, a TREC-type experiment is carried out to validate the proposed method in terms of Precision, Recall, and F1-measure, demonstrating that it can identify accurate and comprehensive medical terms. Based on the identified medical terms, an empirical analysis is conducted to verify the influence of medical terms used by doctors on the service quality of E-health. The analysis results show that for patients with low health literacy, the use of medical terms by doctors would decrease their service quality. However, for patients with high health literacy, the use of medical terms by doctors can significantly increase their service quality, revealing that doctors could improve their service quality in E-health by adjusting their medical term usage according to the health literacy of patients.

"Exploring the Effects of Loneliness and Internet Addiction on Adultsâ€™ Well-Being During COVID-19 Quarantine","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to hit in repeated spreading waves, the population worldwide continues to be under stressful lockdowns and quarantine and getting more dependent on Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Evidence is needed to identify the mental health impact of quarantine on loneliness and Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and find the significant risk factors. This study explores the association of loneliness, internet addiction and related factors such as the number of hours spent online, and the quality of the relationship of people spending the quarantine with on well-being using the Internet addiction scale, UCL loneliness short scale, and WHO-5 measure. The data from a sample of 613 adults from the Middle East were analyzed through SPSS using correlation and regression. The results showed an association between loneliness, internet addiction and low well-being;the number of hours spent online was negatively correlated with well-being, and the quality of the relationship with people spending the quarantine was positively associated with well-being. The results confirm the negative consequences of internet addiction, loneliness and spending long hours online on well-being during quarantine, and the importance of the quality of the relationship with whom one is spending quarantine in supporting well-being.

It also is named for Ben Price, an Illinois man who exhibited mental health problems after a prolonged stay in the hospital for COVID-19 and died by suicide. Gonzalez says neither of them had a history of mental illness before their COVID-19 diagnosis. Gonzalez said he's seeking U.S. Senate co-sponsors for the bill and believes it has a good chance of incorporation into more significant legislation if it doesn't pass on its own.

"Occupational psychosocial stressors and mental distress among healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic","ABSTRACT Objective To analyze the factors associated with mental distress among health workers who cared for patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A cross-sectional analytical study of national scope, carried out between in the second quarter of 2020. A total of 437 health professionals, who filled out an electronic form about sociodemographic data, occupational aspects, psychosocial characteristics of work and mental distress. Multiple logistic regression was performed to analyze the covariables associated with mental distress. Results There was a predominance of workers on the nursing team (65.0%), female (71.0%), from Southeastern region of the country (68.6%) and with no morbidities (36.2%). The prevalence of mental distress was 61.6%. Job strain was reported by 24% of participants, and the perception of low support from coworkers was described by 52.9%. The final multiple regression model showed that mental distress was associated with females (odds ratio - OR: 1.93;95%CI: 1.22-3.07), age up to 40 years (OR: 1.64;95%CI: 1.07-2.52), weekly working hours equal or over 60 hours (OR: 1.87;95%CI: 1.15-3.11), job strain (OR: 2.45;95%CI: 1.41-4.40) and low support from co-workers (OR: 3.47;95%CI: 2.26-5.38). Conclusion Six out of ten participants presented mental distress, which was associated to both individual characteristics and factors related to the work carried out during the pandemic. There is an urgent need to map services that have such characteristics, to outline actions to promote mental health and prevent emotional distress at different levels of health care.","Silva-Junior, JoÃ£o Silvestre, da Cunha, Arthur Arantes, LourenÃ§Ã£o, Daniela Campos de Andrade, da Silva, Silmar Maria, da Silva, Renata Flavia Abreu, Faria, Magda GuimarÃ£es de Araujo, Mininel, Vivian Aline, Almeida, Mirian Cristina dos Santos, Baptista, PatrÃ­cia Campos Pavan, Gallasch, Cristiane Helena","https://www.google.com/search?q=Occupational+psychosocial+stressors+and+mental+distress+among+healthcare+workers+during+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil); 19, 2021.; Publication details: Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil); 19, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21756,""
"Genome-wide association study of problematic opioid prescription use in 132,113 23andMe research participants of European ancestry","The growing prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) constitutes an urgent health crisis. Ample evidence indicates that risk for OUD is heritable. As a surrogate (or proxy) for OUD, we explored the genetic basis of using prescription opioids â€˜not as prescribedâ€™. We hypothesized that misuse of opiates might be a heritable risk factor for OUD. To test this hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of problematic opioid use (POU) in 23andMe research participants of European ancestry (N = 132,113;21% cases). We identified two genome-wide significant loci (rs3791033, an intronic variant of KDM4A;rs640561, an intergenic variant near LRRIQ3). POU showed positive genetic correlations with the twoÂ largest available GWAS of OUD andÂ opioid dependence (rg = 0.64,Â 0.80, respectively). We also identified numerous additional genetic correlations with POU, including alcohol dependence (rg = 0.74), smoking initiation (rg = 0.63), pain relief medication intake (rg = 0.49), major depressive disorder (rg = 0.44), chronic pain (rg = 0.42), insomnia (rg = 0.39), and loneliness (rg = 0.28). Although POU was positively genetically correlated with risk-taking (rg = 0.38), conditioning POU on risk-taking did not substantially alter the magnitude or direction of these genetic correlations, suggesting that POU does not simply reflect a genetic tendency towards risky behavior. Lastly, we performed phenome- and lab-wide association analyses, which uncovered additional phenotypes that were associated with POU, including respiratory failure, insomnia, ischemic heart disease, and metabolic and blood-related biomarkers. We conclude that opioid misuse can be measured in population-based cohorts and provides a cost-effective complementary strategy for understanding the genetic basis of OUD.","Sanchez-Roige, Sandra, Fontanillas, Pierre, Jennings, Mariela V.; Bianchi, Sevim B.; Huang, Yuye, Hatoum, Alexander S.; Sealock, Julia, Davis, Lea K.; Elson, Sarah L.; andMe Research, Team, Palmer, Abraham A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Genome-wide+association+study+of+problematic+opioid+prescription+use+in+132,113+23andMe+research+participants+of+European+ancestry","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Molecular psychiatry;: 1-9, 2021.; Publication details: Molecular psychiatry;: 1-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21757,""

Our study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients after one year. Online questionnaires were administered, and clinical interviews were conducted to assess OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, information about COVID-19 and mental resilience at baseline (1 December 2019â€“1 January 2020), during early COVID-19 (26 Februaryâ€“25 March 2020) and at the one-year follow-up (26 Februaryâ€“25 March 2021). A total of 110 OCD patients were enrolled. Our findings showed that OCD, depressive and anxiety symptoms worsened during early COVID-19, and the negative impact persisted at the one-year follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed that female gender, concern about COVID-19 and OCD symptom severity at baseline were risk factors for exacerbation of OCD symptoms during early COVID-19, while optimism, as one composite factor of resilience, was a protective factor against exacerbation of OCD symptoms both during early COVID-19 and at follow-up. Our study showed that COVID-19 had immediate and long-term impacts on the exacerbation of OCD symptoms, and interventions targeted at improving resilience are recommended.","Liao, Jinmin, Liu, Lijun, Fu, Xiaoyu, Feng, Yingying, Liu, Wei, Yue, Weihua, Yan, Jun","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+immediate+and+long-term+impacts+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+patients+with+obsessive-compulsive+disorder:+A+one-year+follow-up+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Psychiatry research;2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry research;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21759,""

"Vocal for local through krishi vigyan kendras","The World Health Organization (WHO) declared corona virus outbreak a pandemic. World is fighting hard and preparing each day to face new challenge for dual situation;one is to save lives from the pandemic caused due to COVID -19 and other is its impact as a giant forthcoming situation of unemployment, hunger and depression. Saxena, 2020 reported that data from various studies show that about 1.3 billion people are affected due to ongoing lockdown and about 10 Crore Indians lost their jobs. On 13.5.2020, the Prime Minister of India, Sh. Narendra Modi Ji appealed 'vocal for local' during his corona virus lockdown address (Tripathi, 2020). Make in India has become a necessity to support and sustain the population and India's economy. The crisis situation in India may be turned into an opportunity by making need based products at local level, for the local markets. There is also an urgent need to involve women in economic activities. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) is established all over the country by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi. The integrated work of this team is expected to cater to the need of farmer, farm women, rural youth and school drop outs from farm to fork. KVKs system may be the mile stone to turn the slogan, ""vocal for local"" by generating entrepreneurs, employment and addressing the problem of malnutrition. The motto of ""vocal the local"" may not only initiate a mindset to change dreams into realities but also cater to people's changed choices. The KVKs system may show tremendous success rate in the development of micro and large scale entrepreneurs provided training is planned meticulously and jointly by all the subject matter specialists. It is imperative to understand the core strength and spirit of KVKs system by the subject matter specialists and coordinators and pursue it effectively and as a team. The aim of each KVKs employee should be to treat each person (farmer, farm women, youth and school dropout) as a potential entrepreneur.","Kanchan, Sandhu, Chauhan, J.

"Group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy via Telebehavioral Health for Those With Psychotic Spectrum Disorders: A Case Series","Telebehavioral health emerged as an important practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as an opportunity for continued evidence-based mental health intervention, while minimizing exposure to coronavirus contagion. Though preliminary research suggests feasibility and positive outcomes of telebehavioral health practice for people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, there is limited research about implementation and effectiveness of this practice (Kasckow et al., 2014). This case series highlights the transition from in-person to telebehavioral health practice of a Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Schizophrenia group due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article summarizes: (a) the staff procedures needed to transition the group from in-person to telebehavioral health, (b) participant outcome data, (c) session attendance data, and (d) survey results from facilitators and participants about barriers and facilitators of the transition to telebehavioral health, and about how the virtual platform altered the therapeutic relationship and engagement. Participant outcome and engagement data suggest that, not only were two participants able to transition to telehealth and complete the program, but both participants also showed notable improvement in treatment engagement, goal progress, and skill acquisition. Surveys of six facilitators and one participant highlight how the transition to telebehavioral health had treatment advantages (e.g., therapeutic relationship, treatment engagement, group dynamics). Though survey results highlighted several implementation challenges in using the new virtual platform (e.g., technological connectivity, confidential space for engagement), no survey respondents reported that participation in this program resulted in harm to facilitators or participants. All facilitators and one participant agreed that the transition from in-person to virtual services was easy and reduced transportation barriers. Given the limited treatment engagement for this population (Lora et al., 2012) and the importance of early intervention to maximize clinical outcomes (Black et al., 2001;Bottlender et al., 2003), unanimous facilitator and participant report about improved patient attendance and participation in treatment after the transition to telebehavioral health was critically important. Though results of this case study are promising in suggesting telebehavioral health could be a viable modality for providing psychosocial treatment to people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, more rigorous study is needed.","Joseph, H.

"Residentâ€™s pushed to the brink: A wake-up call to change the healthcare curriculum","Background: Anesthetists experience a lot of stress on a daily basis and they take charge during a health crisis. Unfortunately, mindfulness and coping strategies are rarely taught during training. With the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, some might struggle to cope. Our goal was to uncover the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety, stress, and depression among anesthesia residents during the crisis. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. We sent a questionnaire to the anesthesia residents enrolled in the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties anesthesia residency program in the western region of Saudi Arabia. This questionnaire included demographic data, concerns and coping methods. We also included questionnaires for stress, anxiety and depression. Results: We achieved a 77% (93 residents) reply rate. Around 25% of the residents had trouble coping. There was a high prevalence of moderate-major stress and depression at 89% and 50% respectively. The biggest concern was contracting the virus (66%), infecting their family members (81.5%), and a delay in graduation as a result of the pandemic (59.8%). There was a statistically significant relationship between living alone and depression. Conclusions: A health crisis can have a serious impact on psychological well-being of anesthetisia residents. It is essential that they are provided with support services ans well as incorporating well-being training into their curriculum. Â© 2021, American University of Beirut.

"From cholera to corona: the Norwegian infection control between conflicting interests","The cholera epidemic in 1853 led to the Health Act in 1860, while the AIDS epidemic from the 1980s led to the Infection Control Act in 1995. These laws shaped the organization of infection control and the fight against epidemics in Norway. Presently, the municipal doctors and the National Institute of Public Health play the most important roles in infection control. On the other hand, the municipal board, the Norwegian Directorate of Health, and the Ministry of Health and Care Services are responsible for overall decisions. Since the middle of the 19th century, infection control has been influenced by five lines of conflict that run between miasms and infectious substances, between individuals and society, between business and society, between municipalities and the state, and between professions, administration and politics. The debate about the nature of epidemic diseases has left a distinction between environmental health care and infection control. The individual's freedom versus society's need for protection has been at the core of the debate on infection control and the very rationale for legal regulation. The relationship between municipal and state management still creates challenges today, and so does the distribution of power between disciplines, administration, and politics. The corona pandemic in 2020 will probably lead to new changes in Norwegian infection control. Truth of the matter is that the municipal doctor has again become central, and the municipal self-government has been strengthened.","Aavitsland, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=From+cholera+to+corona:+the+Norwegian+infection+control+between+conflicting+interests","","Database: GIM; Publication details: Michael; 17(4):648-659, 2021.; Publication details: Michael; 17(4):648-659, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21766,""

"Surviving SARS and living through COVID-19: Healthcare worker mental health outcomes and insights for coping","Explore how previous work during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak affects the psychological response of clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers (HCWs) to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, multi-centered hospital online survey of HCWs in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Mental health outcomes of HCWs who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic and the SARS outbreak were assessed using Impact of Events-Revised scale (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Among 3852 participants, moderate/severe scores for symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (50.2%), anxiety (24.6%), and depression (31.5%) were observed among HCWs. Work during the 2003 SARS outbreak was reported by 1116 respondents (29.1%), who had lower scores for symptoms of PTSD (P = .002), anxiety (P &lt; .001), and depression (P &lt; .001) compared to those who had not worked during the SARS outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed non-clinical HCWs during this pandemic were at higher risk of anxiety (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.19-2.15, P = .01) and depressive symptoms (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.34-3.07, P &lt; .001). HCWs using sedatives (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.61-4.03, P &lt; .001), those who cared for only 2-5 patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.06-2.38, P = .01), and those who had been in isolation for COVID-19 (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.96-1.93, P = .05), were at higher risk of moderate/severe symptoms of PTSD.

"Prevalence of COVID-19-Related Social Disruptions and Effects on Psychosocial Health in a Mixed-Serostatus Cohort of Men and Women","This study describes prevention behavior and psychosocial health among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and HIV-negative people during the early wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. We assessed differences by HIV status and associations between social disruption and psychosocial health. A cross-sectional telephone/videoconference administered survey of 3411 PLHIV and HIV-negative participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). An instrument combining new and validated measures was developed to assess COVID-19 prevention efforts, social disruptions (loss of employment, childcare, health insurance, and financial supports), experiences of abuse, and psychosocial health. Interviews were performed between April and June 2020. Associations between social disruptions and psychosocial health were explored using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for sociodemographics and HIV status. Almost all (97.4%) participants reported COVID-19 prevention behavior; 40.1% participants reported social disruptions, and 34.3% reported health care appointment disruption. Men living with HIV were more likely than HIV-negative men to experience social disruptions (40.6% vs. 32.9%; P &lt; 0.01), whereas HIV-negative women were more likely than women with HIV to experience social disruptions (51.1% vs. 39.8%, P &lt; 0.001). Participants who experienced Ã¢â€°Â¥2 social disruptions had significantly higher odds of depression symptoms [aOR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 1.56], anxiety (aOR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.17 to 2.27), and social support dissatisfaction (aOR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.60). This study builds on emerging literature demonstrating the psychosocial health impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing context specific to PLHIV. The ongoing pandemic requires structural and social interventions to decrease social disruption and address psychosocial health needs among the most vulnerable populations.","Friedman, Kempf, Benning, Adimora, Aouizerat, Cohen, Hatfield, Merenstein, Mimiaga, Plankey, Sharma, Sheth, Ramirez, Stosor, Wagner, Wilson, D'Souza, Weiss","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002799","20211110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21771,""
"Suicide and drug toxicity mortality in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: use of medical examiner data for public health in Nova Scotia","The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses have raised concerns about any corresponding rise in suicide and/or drug toxicity mortality due to exacerbations of mental illness, economic issues, changes to drug supply, ability to access harm reduction services, and other factors. Data were obtained from the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service. Case definitions were developed, and their performance characteristics assessed. Pre-pandemic trends in monthly suicide and drug toxicity deaths were modelled and the observed numbers of deaths in the pandemic year compared to expected numbers. There was a significant reduction in suicide deaths in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, with about 21 fewer non-drug toxicity suicide deaths than expected in March 2020 to February 2021 (risk ratio = 0.82). No change in drug toxicity mortality was detected. Case definitions were successfully applied to free-text cause of death statements and cases where cause and manner of death remained under investigation. Processes for case classification and monitoring can be implemented in collaboration with medical examiners/coroners for timely, ongoing public health surveillance of suicide and drug toxicity mortality. Medical examiners and coroners are the stewards of a wealth of data that could inform the prevention of further deaths; it is time to engage these systems in public health surveillance.

"COVID-19 and Youth Sports: What Are the Risks of Getting Back on the Field Too Quickly?","The widespread shutdown in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, although varied across state and county levels, has undoubtedly impacted everyone to some degree. Within the pediatric population, the closure of schools and organized youth athletic programs has resulted in a unique situation that has made athletes physically deconditioned and at risk for injury. As sports and competition gradually restart, there are considerable risks to the skeletally immature athlete. The anatomic and physiologic changes that occur to bone and cartilage during growth make the young athlete particularly susceptible to both acute and overuse injuries. In the context of the pandemic, deconditioning, obesity, lack of variety, and the resultant mental health burden pose unique challenges in ensuring that young athletes safely return to the field. This review aims to identify risk factors for sport-related injuries and to outline strategies for minimizing these injuries as pediatric patients return-to-play after COVID-19. <b>[<i>Pediatr Ann.</i> 2021;50(11):e465-e469.]</b>.","Wang, Vander Voort, Haus, Carter","https://doi.org/10.3928/19382359-20211019-01","20211110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21773,""

"Reexamining Social Media and Socioemotional Well-Being Among Adolescents Through the Lens of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Theoretical Review and Directions for Future Research","Social media has rapidly transformed the ways in which adolescents socialize and interact with the world, which has contributed to ongoing public debate about whether social media is helping or harming adolescents. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified both the challenges and opportunities of adolescents' social-media use, which necessitates revisiting the conversation around teens and social media. In this article, we discuss key aspects of adolescent social-media use and socioemotional well-being and outline how these issues may be amplified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use this as a springboard to outline key future research directions for the field, with the goal of moving away from reductionist approaches and toward a more nuanced perspective to understand the <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>, and <i>when</i> of social-media use and its impact on adolescent well-being.

"A Qualitative Study of the COVID-19 Response Experiences of Public Health Workers in the United States","The mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline, patient-facing healthcare staff have been described in several studies, but the effects of the COVID-19 response on the US public health workforce have not been well characterized. In early 2021, we conducted interviews with a subset of public health practitioners in the United States who participated in a cross-sectional survey and indicated their willingness to participate in a follow-up interview. An interview guide was developed to collect information about professional roles since the start of the pandemic, aspects of the individual COVID-19 response that impacted mental health, and aspects of the organizational/institutional COVID-19 response that impacted mental health, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of, opportunities for, and threats to public health professionals and organizations going forward. Interviews were transcribed and inductively coded to identify themes. Of the 48 people invited to participate, 24 completed an interview between January 28 and February 23, 2021. Five key themes were identified through inductive coding of interview transcripts: (1) teamwork and workplace camaraderie, (2) potential for growth in the field of public health, (3) considerations for adaptive work environments (eg, remote work, work out of jurisdiction, transition to telework), (4) politicization of response, and (5) constrained hiring capacity and burnout. After more than a year of public health emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critically important to understand the detrimental and supportive factors of good mental health among the public health workforce.","Scales, Patrick, Stone, Kintziger, Jagger, Horney","https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2021.0132","20211110","Burnout; COVID-19; Epidemic management/response; Mental health; Public health preparedness/response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21776,""

"Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Mental Health and Quality of Life","There has been a dramatic rise in mental health difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While young adults have the lowest risk of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19, they have been identified as being at highest risk of detrimental mental health outcomes during the pandemic, along with women, those with lower socioeconomic status and those with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somewhat of a crisis in mental health has emerged across the general population through the evolution of the pandemic. A national Canadian survey identified a quadrupling of those experiencing pervasive elevated anxiety symptoms early in the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels, and a doubling of those with pervasive elevated depressive symptoms. Independent of the pandemic, persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can face multiple challenges related to their disease, which can result in a significant psychosocial burden and psychologic distress. Anxiety and depression have been found to be more prevalent in persons with IBD. Many potential factors contribute to the increased psychologic distress and negative impacts on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with IBD. These include the fears of contracting COVID-19 or infecting other people. Many believe that IBD or its treatments predispose them to an increased risk of COVID-19 or a worse outcome if acquired. Concerns about access to health care add to mental distress. People with IBD generally report lower quality of life (QOL) compared to community controls. Psychologic interventions, in addition to adequate disease control, have been shown to improve health-related QOL. Uncertainty is another factor associated with reduced health-related QOL. Most studies suggest that persons with IBD have suffered QOL impairment during the pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. Uncertainties brought on by the pandemic are important contributors for some of the reduction in QOL.","Graff, Fowler, Jones, Benchimol, Bitton, Huang, Kuenzig, Kaplan, Lee, Mukhtar, Tandon, Targownik, Windsor, Bernstein","https://doi.org/10.1093/jcag/gwab031","20211110","Coronavirus; CrohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Mental health; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2; Ulcerative colitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21779,""
"Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Children and Expectant Mothers With Inflammatory Bowel Disease","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) typically results in a mild infection, similar to those without IBD. Children and adolescents have less severe manifestations of COVID-19 compared to older people, whether or not they have IBD. However, some IBD medications (in particular, corticosteroids) are associated with more severe COVID-19. During the first year of the global pandemic, more IBD care was provided with online technology, necessitated by efforts to reduce hospital and clinic visits. Additionally, non-endoscopic monitoring of inflammation has been required due to the cancellation of non-urgent procedures, resulting in longer endoscopy wait-times. In contrast, pregnant people (with and without IBD) who contract COVID-19 are at increased risk of severe manifestations, death and preterm delivery, making them a priority for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protective measures and vaccination. Few studies have examined effect of COVID-19 on IBD-related disease activity in pregnant people with IBD. The pandemic has significantly affected the mental health and sense of well-being of children and their families, as well as pregnant people with IBD. These groups were much more likely to experience anxiety and depression compared with prior to the pandemic, even while concern has mostly abated regarding the effect of IBD medications and COVID-19 severity.

"Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 &amp; Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: A Knowledge Translation Strategy","The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in Canada, is over 0.75% in 2021. Many individuals with IBD are immunocompromised. Consequently, the World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic uniquely impacted those with IBD. Crohn's and Colitis Canada (CCC) formed the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce to provide evidence-based guidance during the pandemic to individuals with IBD and their families. The Taskforce met regularly through the course of the pandemic, synthesizing available information on the impact of COVID-19 on IBD. At first, the information was extrapolated from expert consensus guidelines, but eventually, recommendations were adapted for an international registry of worldwide cases of COVID-19 in people with IBD. The task force launched a knowledge translation initiative consisting of a webinar series and online resources to communicate information directly to the IBD community. Taskforce recommendations were posted to CCC's website and included guidance such as risk stratification, management of immunosuppressant medications, physical distancing, and mental health. A weekly webinar series communicated critical information directly to the IBD community. During the pandemic, traffic to CCC's website increased with 484,755 unique views of the COVID-19 webpages and 126,187 views of the 23 webinars, including their video clips. CCC's COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce provided critical guidance to the IBD community as the pandemic emerged, the nation underwent a lockdown, the economy reopened, and the second wave ensued.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with IBD, particularly those on immunosuppressive therapies, were concerned that their health status may place them at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing more severe disease course if infected with SARS-CoV-2. In response, Crohn's and Colitis Canada developed the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce in March 2020 to rapidly synthesize the evolving knowledge of COVID-19 as relevant to Canadians with IBD. The Taskforce communicated expert information directly to the Canadian IBD community through online tools and a webinar series. In order to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on the IBD community, Crohn's and Colitis Canada commissioned a policy report that was informed through a systematic literature review and synthesized across working groups along the following domains: Epidemiology, Children and Expectant Mothers with IBD, Seniors with IBD, Mental Health, Risk Factors and Medications, Vaccines, and Healthcare Delivery during the Pandemic and the Future Model of IBD Care. This report from Canadian physicians, researchers, and IBD community representatives highlights the physical, mental, and health systems impact of COVID-19 on the entire spectrum of the IBD community, including children, adolescents, adults, seniors, and pregnant people with IBD.

"Substance-related coping behaviours among youth during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic","As impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to unfold, research is needed to understand how school-aged youth are coping with COVID-19-related changes and disruptions to daily life. Among a sample of Canadian youth, our objective was to examine the mental health factors associated with using substances to cope with COVID-19-related changes, taking account of expected sex differences. We used online data collected from 7150 students in the COMPASS study, during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (May-July 2020) in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. We specified a sex-stratified, generalized linear mixed model to estimate the likelihood of engagement in substance-related coping behaviours, while testing for the effects of students' mental health, individual characteristics, and school neighborhood characteristics. Twelve percent of students (13.4% of females, 9.9% of males) in our sample reported using cannabis, alcohol, cigarettes, and/or vaping to help cope with COVID-19-related changes. Regardless of sex, students with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to engage in substance-related coping (aOR<sub>Female</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.04, 95Ã‚Â %CI[1.01-1.07]; aOR<sub>Male</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.06, 95Ã‚Â %CI[1.013-1.11]). Among females, better psychosocial wellbeing was protective against engagement in substance related-coping (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.96, 95Ã‚Â %CI[0.94-0.98]), controlling for current substance use. Canadian school-aged youth with generally poor mental health may be more likely to have engaged in substance use to help cope with COVID-19-related changes during the first wave of the pandemic, and female youth may be at disproportionate risk of engaging in the behaviour. Ongoing evaluation of the impacts of COVID-19 on youth health is required.","Romano, Patte, de Groh, Jiang, Wade, BÃƒÂ©langer, Leatherdale","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100392","20211110","Adolescent health; COVID-19 pandemic; Coping behaviour; Mental health; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21783,""
"Tips for Building a Community for Incoming Medical Students Virtually in the COVID-19 Era","A sense of community benefits medical trainees by preserving mental well-being, nurturing collegiality and mentorship, and grounding ties with partnering organizations and services. Within medical school, building these support relationships often begins shortly after matriculation. In the current pandemic and the accompanying shift to a virtual class format, we believe that a dedicated effort to foster this sense of community is crucial for students who otherwise may feel untethered to their new learning environment. Here, we detail tips for building a medical school community virtually in the COVID-19 era between peers, within the school institution, and within the surrounding environment.

"Coping with COVID-19 stress: Associations with depression and anxiety in a diverse sample of US adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented levels of stress to individuals in the U.S. and throughout the world. These high stress levels place individuals at risk for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. The current study applies a control-based model of coping to contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions to promote resilience. Data were collected online from April 22 through July 12, 2020. Data from two samples of U. S. community adults who completed an online battery of standardized questionnaires were combined (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°709). More than a quarter reported moderate to severe levels of depression symptoms, and more than one-fifth reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms; symptom levels were higher among adults who reported more COVID-19-related stress. As hypothesized, multiple regression analyses indicated that greater use of primary and secondary control coping was associated with lower symptom levels, whereas greater use of disengagement coping was associated with higher symptom levels, above and beyond the association of stress with symptoms. Race and ethnicity emerged as important moderators of these associations, indicating that what constitutes adaptive coping varies according to characteristics of the individual. Implications for public health policy and clinical practice are discussed.

"A repeated cross-sectional analysis assessing mental health conditions of adults as per student status during key periods of the COVID-19 epidemic in France","Previous studies have shown the negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on students' mental health. It is, however, uncertain whether students are really at higher risk of mental health disturbances than non-students and if they are differentially impacted by lockdown periods over time. The objective of our study was to compare the frequency of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts in students and non-students enrolled in the same study in France and during the same key periods of the COVID-19 epidemic. Using a repeated cross-sectional design, we collected data from a sample of 3783 participants in the CONFINS study during three recruitment waves between March 2020 and January 2021. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounding factors, showed that students were more likely to have high scores of depressive symptoms and anxiety more frequently than non-students. These differences were particularly strong during the first (depressive symptoms: adjusted odds ratio aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.22-2.08; anxiety: aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.22-2.18) and second lockdowns (depressive symptoms: aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.04-3.12; anxiety: aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.24-4.10). These findings suggest that the restrictive measures-lockdown and curfew-have an alarmingly stronger negative impact on students than on non-students and underline the frailty of students' mental health and the need to pay greater attention to this population in this epidemic-related context.","Macalli, Texier, SchÃƒÂ¼ck, CÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ©, Tzourio","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00471-8","20211110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21786,""
"Changes in the Prevalence of Symptoms of Depression, Loneliness, and Insomnia in US Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Look AHEAD Study","To evaluate changes in the prevalence of depressive symptoms, loneliness, and insomnia among older adults with type 2 diabetes from 2016 to 2020 and to assess risk factors for these conditions including demographics, multimorbidity, BMI, treatment group, and pre-coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) measure scores. This was a prospective, observational study of participants from the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) cohort study. Data were from two assessments before COVID-19 (visit 1: April 2016-June 2018 and visit 2: February 2018-February 2020) and one assessment during COVID-19 (visit 3: July-December 2020). Surveys were administered to assess depressive symptoms, loneliness, and insomnia. The study included 2829 adults (63.2% female, 60.6% White, mean [SD] age 75.6 [6.0] years). The prevalence of mild or greater depressive symptoms did not change significantly between the two prepandemic visits (<i>P</i> = 0.88) but increased significantly from pre- to during COVID-19 (19.3% at V2 to 30.4% at V3; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Higher odds of mild or greater depressive symptoms at V3 were associated with being female (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.4 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]), identifying as non-Hispanic White (OR 1.4 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]), having obesity (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]), and reporting mild or greater depressive symptoms at V1 (OR 4.0 [95% CI 2.9-5.4]), V2 (OR 4.4 [95% CI 3.2-5.9]), or both visits (OR 13.4 [95% CI 9.7-18.4]). The prevalence of loneliness increased from 12.3% at V1 to 22.1% at V3 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), while the prevalence of insomnia remained stable across visits at 31.5-33.3%. The prevalence of mild or greater depressive symptoms in older adults with diabetes was more than 1.6 times higher during COVID-19 than before the pandemic.","Chao, Wadden, Clark, Hayden, Howard, Johnson, LaferrÃƒÂ¨re, McCaffery, Wing, Yanovski, Wagenknecht","https://doi.org/10.2337/dc21-1179","20211110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21787,""
"Health providers' experiences with mental health specialist video consultations in primary care: a qualitative study nested within a randomised feasibility trial","Despite available effective treatments for mental health disorders, few patients in need receive even the most basic care. Integrated telepsychiatry services may be a viable option to increase access to mental healthcare. The aim of this qualitative process evaluation embedded in a randomised controlled feasibility trial was to explore health providers' experiences with a mental healthcare model integrating mental health specialist video consultations (MHSVC) and primary care. A qualitative process evaluation focusing on MHSVC in primary care was conducted. In 13 semistructured interviews, we assessed the experience of all mental health specialists, primary care physicians and medical assistants who participated in the trial. A thematic analysis, focusing on the implementation, mechanisms of impact and context, was applied to investigate the data. Considering (1) the implementation, participants evaluated the consultations as feasible, easy to use and time saving. Concerning (2) the mechanisms of impact, the consultations were regarded as effective for patients. Providers attributed the patients' improvements to two key aspects: the familiarity of the primary care practice and the fast access to specialist mental healthcare. Mental health specialists observed trustful therapeutic alliances emerging and described their experience as comparable to same-room care. However, compared with same-room care, specialists perceived the video consultations as more challenging and sometimes more exhausting due to the additional effort required for establishing therapeutic alliances. Regarding (3) the intervention's context, shorter travel distances for patients positively affected the implementation, while technical failures, that is, poor Internet connectivity, emerged as the main barrier. MHSVCs in primary care are feasible and successful in improving access to mental healthcare for patients. To optimise engagement and comfort of both patients and health providers, future work should focus on empirical determinants for establishing robust therapeutic alliances with patients receiving MHSVC (eg, leveraging non-verbal cues for therapeutic purposes).

"Understanding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life amongst Iranian patients with beta thalassemia major: a grounded theory","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting measures can impact daily life and healthcare management amongst patients with beta thalassemia major. The Corbin and Strauss method of grounded theory was used to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) amongst Iranian patients with beta thalassemia major. Semi-structured interviews with 16 patients with thalassemia major in the eastern of Iran were performed. Data collection was conducted from 19 September through 18 November 2020. Collected data were recorded, transcribed, and coded to develop themes and subthemes. Paradigm components were sought to find out what happened to these patients and explore the process and events. Insights from these interviews led to five major themes: 'changing physical health', 'emotional and psychological reactions', 'changing the nature of relationships and the scope of social support', 'metamorphosis of ongoing healthcare, and 'functionality and adaptation to new realities.' The emerging core concept was labelled: 'maintaining well-being balance.' The COVID-19 pandemic disturbed the balance of life and health of the patients. Multiple strategies to maintain balance and reduce the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQoL were used by the patients, the healthcare team, and support systems. Due to the fear of COVID-19, the patients with beta thalassemia were less likely to contact healthcare professionals. They considered postponing blood transfusion and abandoned evaluating disease complications. Reduced access to the healthcare system and shifting resources from existing programmes to COVID-19 by the healthcare system were incompatible policies. These policies and strategies had strong and negative effects on the physical domain of HRQoL. The patients experienced a deterioration of emotional functioning. They reported a strong reduction in social functioning and felt lonely. Online interventions supporting mental health and social interactions and telemedicine can help during the times of social distancing and lockdowns.","Arian, Vaismoradi, Badiee, Soleimani","https://doi.org/10.1017/S146342362100013X","20211110","beta thalassemia major; coronavirus; grounded theory; health care; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21789,""
"COVID-19 related differences in the uptake and effects of internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder","The impacts of COVID-19 for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be considerable. Online cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) programmes provide scalable access to psychological interventions, although the effectiveness of iCBT for OCD during COVID-19 has not been evaluated. This study investigated the uptake and effectiveness of iCBT for OCD (both self- and clinician-guided courses) during the first 8 months of the pandemic in Australia (March to October 2020) and compared outcomes with the previous year. 1,343 adults (824/1343 (61.4%) female, mean age 33.54 years, SD = 12.00) commenced iCBT for OCD (1061 during the pandemic and 282 in the year before) and completed measures of OCD (Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionaire-9) symptom severity, psychological distress (Kessler-10), and disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule) pre- and post-treatment. During COVID-19, there was a 522% increase in monthly course registrations compared with the previous year, with peak uptake observed between April and June 2020 (a 1191% increase compared with April to June 2019). OCD and depression symptom severity were similar for the COVID and pre-COVID groups, although COVID-19 participants were more likely to enrol in self-guided courses (versus clinician-guided). In both pre- and during-COVID groups, the OCD iCBT course was associated with medium effect size reductions in OCD (g = 0.65-0.68) and depression symptom severity (g = 0.56-0.65), medium to large reductions in psychological distress (g = 0.77-0.83) and small reductions in disability (g = 0.35-.50). Results demonstrate the considerable uptake of online psychological services for those experiencing symptoms of OCD during COVID-19 and highlight the scalability of effective digital mental health services.","Li, Millard, Haskelberg, Hobbs, Luu, Mahoney","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465821000448","20211110","OCD; effectiveness; iCBT; internet intervention; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21790,""
"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder and childhood maltreatment, adulthood stressful life events and depression among Lebanese university students: a structural equation modeling approach","Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a cyclic sequence of physical and behavioral symptoms that arise in the second half of the menstrual cycle. The extreme type of PMS is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). The current study aims at examining 1) the effects of childhood maltreatment and current life's stressful events on PMDD, and 2) the mediating role of depression in these associations among Lebanese university female students. This cross-sectional study was conducted between February and March 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lebanese students were recruited using a snowball technique from all national universities in Lebanon via an auto-administrated online survey. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the structural relationship between childhood maltreatment and life's stressful events, depression and PMDD. Higher life's stressful events (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.18; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), physical (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.19; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), sexual (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.18; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and psychological (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.33; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) abuse were significantly associated with higher depression. Moreover, higher sexual (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.11; pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021) and psychological (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.11; pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.040) abuse and higher depression (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.37; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were significantly associated with higher PMDD. The indirect relationships between psychological abuse/sexual abuse, depression and PMDD showed that depression mediated the association between both psychological (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22; pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and sexual (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.38; pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004) abuse and PMDD. This work presents a unique analysis using the structural equation model that enlightens the effect of childhood maltreatment, particularly sexual and psychological abuse on PMMD symptoms, with depression playing the role of a mediating factor. It would be interesting to test, in future studies, whether there are other mediating factors besides depression that could be indirect indicators of PMDD.","Younes, Hallit, Obeid","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03567-7","20211110","Childhood maltreatment; Depression; Lebanese women; Premenstrual dysphoric disorder; lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stressful events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-11","",21791,""
