"Long COVID Optimal Health Programme (LC-OHP) to enhance psychological and physical health: a feasibility randomised controlled trial protocol","Long COVID is a collection of symptoms that develop during or following a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, that continue for more than 12 weeks. Despite the negative impact of long COVID on people's lives and functioning, there is no validated treatment or even rehabilitation guidance. What has been recommended thus far, is adoption of holistic management approaches. The Optimal Health Programme (OHP) is a brief 5-session, plus booster, psychosocial programme designed to support mental and physical wellbeing that has been used effectively for a range of chronic conditions. This study examines the feasibility and acceptability of employing a specially customised version of OHP (long COVID OHP or LC-OHP) to improve psychological and physical health of people with long COVID. This is a feasibility randomised controlled trial that will be running from November 2021 to October 2022. Eligible participants aged 18 years or older who are experiencing symptoms of long COVID will be identified through their secondary practitioners with recruitment to be undertaken by the research team. Sixty participants will be randomised into a control (usual care) or an intervention (LC-OHP) group. Outcomes will be feasibility and acceptability of the programme (primary); and efficacy of the LC-OHP in improving anxiety, depression, fatigue, self-efficacy and quality of life (secondary). Up to 20 participants will be interviewed at the end of the trial to explore their experience with the programme. Quantitative data will be analysed using SPSS and differences between groups will be compared using inferential tests where appropriate. Qualitative data will be transcribed and thematically analysed to identify common emerging themes. This is an ongoing study which began in November 2021. The study received approval from the University of Suffolk Ethics committee (RETH21/004) and from the NHS Health Research Authority (IRAS no. 304234). Long COVID has a significant impact on an individual's mental and physical functioning. The LC-OHP has a potential to provide people living with long COVID with additional support and to improve self-efficacy. Findings of this study would identify the feasibility of delivering this programme to this population and will provide an indication for the programme's effectiveness.

"A Dog with an Office: The Process of Embedding a Wellness Dog Intervention in a University Setting","Universities are places to promote the wellbeing of people who learn, work, and live within them. This article reports on an innovative, holistic, and embedded wellness dog program that was developed by the Faculty of Nursing to support the wellbeing of students, faculty, and staff. The innovation included a collaborative partnership between two faculties (the faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Nursing), and the targeted purchase, training, and socialization of a wellness dog. Pet wellness programs have the potential to be an important mental health intervention on university campuses. While the program was postponed due to COVID-19, the purpose of this article is to share processes used to create the wellness dog program, with suggestions regarding implementation and evaluation.","Smith, Smith, Nowell, Lind, Chalhoub, McMillan, Jackson, Dela Cruz","https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2022.2067275","20220425","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30510,""
"Million Veteran Program's response to COVID-19: Survey development and preliminary findings","In response to the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP) organized efforts to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on Veterans by developing and deploying a self-reported survey. The MVP COVID-19 Survey was developed to collect COVID-19 specific elements including symptoms, diagnosis, hospitalization, behavioral and psychosocial factors and to augment existing MVP data with longitudinal collection of key domains in physical and mental health. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, a multipronged strategy was implemented to widely disseminate the COVID-19 Survey and capture data using both the online platform and mailings. We limited the findings of this paper to the initial phase of survey dissemination which began in May 2020. A total of 729,625 eligible MVP Veterans were invited to complete version 1 of the COVID-19 Survey. As of October 31, 2020, 58,159 surveys have been returned. The mean and standard deviation (SD) age of responders was 71 (11) years, 8.6% were female, 8.2% were Black, 5.6% were Hispanic, and 446 (0.8%) self-reported a COVID-19 diagnosis. Over 90% of responders reported wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequent hand washing. The MVP COVID-19 Survey provides a systematic collection of data regarding COVID-19 behaviors among Veterans and represents one of the first large-scale, national surveillance efforts of COVID-19 in the Veteran population. Continued work will examine the overall response to the survey with comparison to available VA health record data.","Whitbourne, Nguyen, Song, Lord, Lyden, Harrington, Ward, Li, Brewer, Cho, Djousse, Muralidhar, Tsao, Gaziano, Casas","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266381","20220425","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30511,""
"Virtual care use during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on healthcare utilization in patients with chronic disease: A population-based repeated cross-sectional study","It is currently unclear how the shift towards virtual care during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may have impacted chronic disease management at a population level. The goals of our study were to provide a description of the levels of use of virtual care services relative to in-person care in patients with chronic disease across Ontario, Canada and to describe levels of healthcare utilization in low versus high virtual care users. We used linked health administrative data to conduct a population-based, repeated cross-sectional study of all ambulatory patient visits in Ontario, Canada (January 1, 2018 to January 16, 2021). Further stratifications were also completed to examine patients with COPD, heart failure, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, mental illness, and angina. Patients were classified as low (max 1 virtual care visit) vs. high virtual care users. A time-series analysis was done using interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling on weekly hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and diagnostic tests. The use of virtual care increased across all chronic disease patient populations. Virtual care constituted at least half of the total care in all conditions. Both low and high virtual care user groups experienced a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations and laboratory testing at the start of the pandemic. Hospitalization volumes increased again only among the high users, while testing increased in both groups. Outpatient visits among high users remained unaffected by the pandemic but dropped in low users. The decrease of in-person care during the pandemic was accompanied by an increase in virtual care, which ultimately allowed patients with chronic disease to return to the same visit rate as they had before the onset of the pandemic. Virtual care was adopted across various chronic conditions, but the relative adoption of virtual care varied by condition with highest rates seen in mental health.","Stamenova, Chu, Pang, Fang, Shakeri, Cram, Bhattacharyya, Bhatia, Tadrous","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267218","20220425","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30512,""
"Breathing and Relaxation Exercises Help Improving Fear of COVID-19, Anxiety, and Sleep Quality: A Randomized Controlled Trial","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To investigate the effects of breathing and relaxation exercises performed via telerehabilitation on fear, anxiety, sleep quality, and quality of life of individuals without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the ongoing pandemic. <b><i>Design:</i></b> A prospective, randomized, controlled single-blind study. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Fifty participants who had not been exposed to the COVID-19 virus earlier were randomly divided into experimental (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25) and control groups (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25). Both groups received an information session about COVID-19 once at the start of the study via a mobile phone video application. The experimental group also performed a breathing and relaxation exercise program twice daily (morning and evening), 7 days per week, for 4 weeks; one session of the program was conducted under the remote supervision of a physiotherapist as telerehabilitation, and the remaining sessions were performed as a home program. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), which was the primary outcome measure, The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and EQ-5D-3L were administered to both groups. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The FCV-19S, HAMA, and PSQI were statistically significantly improved to compare the controls, with a large effect size (ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.135, 0.313, and 0.200, respectively). The EQ-5D-3L index and EQ-5D-3L visual analog scale were not statistically significantly different compared with the controls; however, a small effect size was detected for the differences between the two groups (ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.056 and 0.013, respectively). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Breathing and relaxation exercises appear to be an effective and feasible approach to support mental health and sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially in highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19, telerehabilitation approaches may be useful for safely reaching individuals by eliminating human-to-human contact.

"Changes in secondary substance use after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic among people who use cannabis: Findings from a web-based sample of adults in the United States","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had widespread impacts on mental health and substance use. Increases in cannabis use have been documented in the United States, but little is known about how other substance use has changed among people who use cannabis. We sought to examine changes in alcohol, tobacco, opioid, and stimulant use during COVID-19 and explore how these changes relate to patterns of cannabis use. Data were obtained from a web-based survey of adults in the United States who use cannabis (<i>n</i> = 1,471) administered in September 2020. Using data reported in retrospective (prepandemic) and time-of-survey assessment periods, we explored changes in the prevalence of regular (Ã¢â€°Â¥ weekly) alcohol, tobacco, opioid, and stimulant use during COVID-19 among respondents who used medical and nonmedical cannabis. We used modified Poisson regression to examine cannabis-related correlates of increasing or decreasing secondary substance use during the pandemic. There was a slight but significant increase in Ã¢â€°Â¥weekly alcohol use in the medical use group only (41.4%-47.0%, <i>p</i> = .034). Ã¢â€°Â¥ Weekly tobacco, opioid, and stimulant use did not change significantly. Pandemic-concurrent shifts in secondary substance use depended on interacting cannabis-related factors including medical cannabis use, prepandemic cannabis frequency, and pandemic-concurrent frequency changes. For example, Ã¢â€°Â¥ weekly prepandemic cannabis use was significantly and positively associated with decreasing opioid use frequency among the medical cannabis use group only. Assessments of the pandemic's effects on substance use should consider relationships between cannabis and other substances, which may differ according to cannabis-specific behaviors, motives, and contexts of use.

"Determinants of maternal stress during COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and Spain: A cross-cultural investigation","The present study aims to investigate cross-cultural differences and similarities in maternal and children's adjustment to COVID-19 restrictions in Spain and Italy, with reference to determinants of maternal stress. A total of 950 mothers (45.4% from Spain, <i>n</i> = 432, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 39.6, years old, <i>SD</i> = 5.2 and 54.5% from Italy, <i>n</i> = 518, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 40.5, years, <i>SD</i> = 6.4) of children aged 3-17 years old completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and COVID-19 contextual factors, parenting-related variables, and children externalizing behaviors using an online survey. We examined determinants of parental stress in both countries. Mothers reported a significant increase in parental stress and child externalizing behaviors during COVID-19 home confinement, with more remarkable perceived changes in the Spanish group. Hierarchical linear regressions showed that child age and externalizing behaviors, maternal psychological distress, quality of coparenting and pre-COVID-19 levels of parental stress significantly predicted parental stress in both Italian and Spanish mothers during the pandemic. Results confirmed the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 home confinement on parents and children across countries and revealed common underlying factors responsible for parental stress in Italy and Spain. These findings highlighted the need for communitarian preventive programs to reduce mental health difficulties and parental stress in mothers and behavioral difficulties in children during pandemic restrictions. Particular attention should be paid to young mothers and children, and the key role of positive partner support and coparenting relationships should be considered.

"Work in stressful conditions in medical emergency system during the COVID-19 pandemic","The pandemic caused a change in the way of providing healthcare services, limiting direct access to doctors, suspending planned treatments and medical consultations, but despite the risks and restrictions, the medical rescue system as a key element of health care for the society continues to function. The system provides medical assistance to patients in the most severe condition, both with a negative result for SARS-CoV-2, as well as with a positive or undiagnosed result. It is a review aimed at analyzing the most important psychological aspects of the work of emergency medical care system personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar search were used to analyze the problem. The following keywords were used to search for information sources: paramedic, work, emergency medical care system, emergency department, ambulance service, COVID-19, pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus. The articles were selected in terms of the psychological aspects of the work of the emergency medical care system personnel during the pandemic in 2020-2021. The psychosocial problems that come to the fore during a pandemic include increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, emotional exhaustion, vicarious traumatization, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In the context of the increased risk of psychological problems due to pandemic, it is necessary to provide psychological support to the medical staff, both in terms of psychological support for the entire team and individually.

"From Ancient Hatei to Hubris Syndrome in SARS-CoV-2 Health Crisis Management","COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted, in a very inflictive way, the need for less hubristic political leadership, revealing the menaces of arrogant decision making of those in power. Hubris Syndrome is associated with power and it is more likely to manifest itself the longer the person exercises power and the greater the power he exercises, while our modern times 'Hatei' (the goddess that blinded ancient leaders committing hubris) may be called positive illusion enhancement due to prolonged exposure to power. Hatei might also blurs the decision makers' vision through a hormonal pathway, since hormones seem to affect risk taking, as well as through serotonin, which is also involved in the regulation of decision making and processing punishment-related information, deficiencies of which could be relevant to Hubris Syndrome. Other findings may provide information regarding the neuro-anatomical 'location' of Hatei, since fronto-striatal and limbic-striatal dopaminergic pathways have been identified as important regulators of impulsive behaviors. Therefore we might consider choosing political leaders and state officials whose less illusionary character is more likely to become non-flammable against the fire of hubris, in periods of crisis like the current COVID-19 Pandemic. Especially in SARS-CoV-2 era we should bring whatever scientific data there may be to tackle the intoxicating effects of power, keeping also in mind that there are no anti-hubris medication and that it is unlikely to have this social construct improved via pharmacology. Before establishing constitutional procedures for the early diagnosis of hubris as well as for the subsequent constrain of our leaders' power, we should focus on the criteria by which we elect them and maybe include the pre-existence of depressive diathesis among those criteria, especially if we consider that those leaders might have to handle tough situations like the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, that require increased empathy in decision making.","Liapis","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.111","20220425","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30524,""

"Opioid overdose decedent characteristics during COVID-19","Alongside the emergence of COVID-19 in the United States, several reports highlighted increasing rates of opioid overdose from preliminary data. Yet, little is known about how state-level opioid overdose death trends and decedent characteristics have evolved using official death records. We requested vital statistics data from 2018-2020 from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, receiving data from 14 states. Accounting for COVID-19, we excluded states without data past March 2020, leaving 11 states for analysis. We defined state-specific analysis periods from March 13 until the latest reliable date in each state's data, then conducted retrospective year-over-year analyses comparing opioid-related overdose death rates, the presence of specific opioids and other psychoactive substances, and decedents' sex, race, and age from 2020 to 2019 and 2019 to 2018 within each state's analysis period. We assessed whether significant changes in 2020 vs. 2019 in opioid overdose deaths were new or continuing trends using joinpoint regression. We found significant increases in opioid-related overdose death rates in Alaska (55.3%), Colorado (80.2%), Indiana (40.1%), Nevada (50.0%), North Carolina (30.5%), Rhode Island (29.6%), and Virginia (66.4%) - all continuing previous trends. Increases in synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths were new in Alaska (136.5%), Indiana (27.6%), and Virginia (16.5%), whilst continuing in Colorado (44.4%), Connecticut (3.6%), Nevada (75.0%), and North Carolina (14.6%). We found new increases in male decedents in Indiana (12.0%), and continuing increases in Colorado (15.2%). We also found continuing increases in Black non-Hispanic decedents in Massachusetts (43.9%) and Virginia (33.7%). This research analyzes vital statistics data from 11 states, highlighting new trends in opioid overdose deaths and decedent characteristics across 10 of these states. These findings can inform state-specific public health interventions and highlight the need for timely and comprehensive fatal opioid overdose data, especially amidst concurrent crises such as COVID-19. Key messages:Our results highlight shifts in opioid overdose trends during the COVID-19 pandemic that cannot otherwise be extracted from aggregated or provisional opioid overdose death data such as those published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids continue to drive increases in fatal overdoses, making it difficult to separate these trends from any possible COVID-19-related factors.Black non-Hispanic people are making up an increasing proportion of opioid overdose deaths in some states.State-specific limitations and variations in data-reporting for vital statistics make it challenging to acquire and analyse up-to-date data on opioid-related overdose deaths. More timely and comprehensive data are needed to generate broader insights on the nature of the intersecting opioid and COVID-19 crises.","Garcia, Stringfellow, DiGennaro, Poellinger, Wood, Wakeman, Jalali","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2067350","20220425","COVID-19; Opioid overdoses; decedent characteristics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30526,""
"Stringent public health measures during COVID-19 across ischemic stroke care systems: the potential impact of patient perceptions on health care-seeking behaviors","Decreases in acute stroke presentations have been reported during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surges. A recent study by Bojti et al. (GeroScience. 2021;43:2231-2248) sought to understand the relationship of public health mandates in Hungary as they were implemented with acute ischemic stroke admissions and interventions during two separate COVID-19 waves. We sought to perform a similar analysis of changes in ischemic stroke care at two distinct medical institutions in the USA. Two separate institutions and systems of ischemic stroke care were evaluated through a regional comprehensive stroke center telestroke service and a Veterans Affairs (VA) inpatient stroke and neurorehabilitation service. Telestroke consultations in a single system in Chicago, IL, were significantly decreased during the first COVID-19 wave during severely restricted public health mandates (z-scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°2), and were less depressed during a subsequent wave with less severe restrictions (z-score approachingÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1), which resembles findings in Hungary as reported by Bojti et al. In contrast, inpatient admissions during the first and second COVID-19 waves to a VA stroke and neurorehabilitation service in Oklahoma City remained unchanged. The Chicago and Hungary patterns of stroke presentations suggest that public perceptions, as informed by regional health mandates, might influence healthcare-seeking behavior. However, the VA experience suggests that specific patient populations may react differently to given public health mandates. These observations highlight that changes in stroke presentation during the COVID-19 pandemic may vary regionally and by patient population as well as by the severity of public health mandates implemented. Further study of COVID-19-related public health policies on acute stroke populations is needed to capture the long-term impact of such policies. Learning from the real-time impact of pandemic surges and public health policy on presentation of acute medical conditions, such as ischemic stroke, may prove valuable for designing effective policies in the future.","Prodan, Batra, Ungvari, Liotta","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-022-00566-8","20220425","Acute stroke population; COVID-19; Health care behaviors; Public health policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30527,""
"Mental Health Care Access and Individual Help-Seeking During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The UJA Covid-19 Jewish Impact Study constitutes a random sample of 4403 adults in Jewish households in the New York area. Collected between February and May 2021, the data include symptoms of depression and anxiety and the use of professional help. Via respondents' zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs), these data are linked to contextual measures of mental health care access from two data sources: the SAMHSA Locator on specialty community treatment clinics, and the Zip Code Business Patterns database on solo and small group practices. Both treatment facilities and office practices are added to multilevel logistic regression models as density rates (per 10,000 people) and as binary indicators of presence. While we find no meaningful relationship between the general presence of mental health care services and help-seeking behavior, the ZCTA-level density of office practices is significantly associated with service utilization among the socially isolated, foreign-born and Hispanics or non-white respondents.","Jacoby, Li","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-00973-3","20220425","Mental health; Service access; Service utilization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30528,""
"How did the psychological impact of COVID-19 change healthcare workers in times of fighting the pandemic?","This study is the second leg of a two-leg project. In the first leg, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers (HCWs) was investigated in the period between the first case in Turkey and the arrival of the first case in the hospital. In this second leg, three months after the first evaluation, we aimed to investigate whether psychological effects of COVID-19 such as stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality have been changed on HCWs. This was a 3-month observational study. 169 hospital staff who participated in the first leg of the study were reached and asked to participate in the second leg evaluation in Gaziantep University Medical Faculty Hospital.110 HCWs accepted to participate. Impact of Event Scale (EIS-R), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess in both two legs. Paired Sample T-test was used for comparison of normally distributed variables. Wilcoxon test was used for the comparison of abnormally distributed variables. SPSS 22.0 software was used in the analysis of variables. Of the HCWs with an average age of 33.9Ã‚Â±6.6 years, 59% (65) were males. There was no significant difference between the two legs in terms of IES-R, DASS-21, and PSQI scales. This study suggests that the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs started with the pandemic, before the arrival of the first case in the hospital. Also, these psychological effects continued similarly without significant change after the initiation of direct contact with COVID-19 patients and even after the increase in COVID-19 patients in a hospital which in they work.","Demir, Sahin, Atalay, Aslan, Elboga, Altindag","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210896","20220425","Pandemics; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; health personnel; healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30529,""
"Eating Disorders in the Time of the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Perspective","Current epidemiological conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate the risk of new onset, recurrence and relapse of eating disorders. The aim of this perspective is to better analyse the phenomenon. Some data suggest that new onset and recurrence/relapse of eating disorders are increasing due to the ongoing pandemic. Government restrictions, self-confinement, social isolation, restriction to healthcare facilities access, delayed access to diagnosis and cure, fear of contagion, distress and difficulties related to telemedicine approach are believed to contribute to this burden. Immune system dysfunction usually observed in undernourishment (e.g., anorexia nervosa) could play a role in delaying the diagnosis of respiratory infections, including COVID-19, and predisposing to possible bacterial superinfection. Conversely, patients with binge eating, obesity or metabolic syndrome are susceptible to high-grade systemic inflammation and poor prognosis once the infection has occurred. Despite some evidence, more detailed data combining research in the field of eating disorders and COVID-19 are required. Many data show that telemedicine has some beneficial aspects, but its impact on long-term mental health is still poorly understood. Short- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 in patients with eating disorders are unknown, but it is likely that they will become more apparent over time. Working on emotion regulating strategies in a post-pandemic world, when people have inadequate control over the background of negative emotions, could be a strategy for treatment in the future. Long-term studies with a larger sample size are essential to assess long-term consequences of blockade on patients and their healthcare providers and identify useful strategies to improve clinical management.","Marucci, Almerighi, Cerutti, Corbo, Zupo, De Iaco, Lisco, Triggiani, De Pergola","https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530322666220422104009","20220425","anorexia nervosa; covid-19; eating disorders; obesity; pandemic; sars-cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30530,""

"The mental health of staff working on intensive care units over the COVID-19 winter surge of 2020 in England: a cross sectional survey","The COVID-19 pandemic generated a surge of critically ill patients greater than the capacity of the UK National Health Service (NHS). There have been multiple well-documented impacts associated with the national COVID-19 pandemic surge on ICU staff, including an increased prevalence of mental health disorders on a scale potentially sufficient to impair high-quality care delivery. We investigated the prevalence of five mental health outcomes; explored demographic and professional predictors of poor mental health outcomes; and describe the prevalence of functional impairment; and explore demographic and professional predictors of functional impairment in ICU staff over the 2020/2021 winter COVID-19 surge in England. English ICU staff were surveyed before, during, and after the winter 2020/2021 surge using a survey which comprised validated measures of mental health. A total of 6080 surveys were completed, by ICU nurses (57.5%), doctors (27.9%), and other healthcare staff (14.5%). Reporting probable mental health disorders increased from 51% (before) to 64% (during), and then decreased to 46% (after). Younger, less experienced nursing staff were most likely to report probable mental health disorders. During and after the winter, &gt;50% of participants met threshold criteria for functional impairment. Staff who reported probable post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, or depression were more likely to meet threshold criteria for functional impairment. The winter of 2020/2021 was associated with an increase in poor mental health outcomes and functional impairment amongst ICU staff during a period of peak caseload. These effects are likely to impact on patient care outcomes and the longer-term resilience of the healthcare workforce.","Hall, Milward, Spoiala, Bhogal, Weston, Potts, Caulfield, Toolan, Kanga, El-Sheikha, Fong, Greenberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2022.03.016","20220425","COVID-19; PTSD; functional impairment; healthcare worker; intensive care; mental health; presenteeism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30533,""

"Gaming My Way to Recovery: A Systematic Scoping Review of Digital Game Interventions for Young People's Mental Health Treatment and Promotion","Nearly all young people use the internet daily. Many youth with mental health concerns, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, are using this route to seek help, whether through digital mental health treatment, illness prevention tools, or supports for mental wellbeing. Videogames also have wide appeal among young people, including those who receive mental health services. This review identifies the literature on videogame interventions for young people, ages 12-29, and maps the data on game use by those with mental health and substance use problems, focusing on evidence for the capacity of games to support treatment in youth mental health services; how stakeholders are involved in developing or evaluating games; and any potential harms and ethical remedies identified. A systematic scoping review methodology was used to identify and assess relevant studies. A search of multiple databases identified a total of 8,733 articles. They were screened, and 49 studies testing 32 digital games retained. An adapted stepped care model, including four levels, or steps, based on illness manifestation and severity, was used as a conceptual framework for organizing target populations, mental health conditions and corresponding digital games, and study results. The 49 selected studies included: 10 studies (20.4%) on mental health promotion/prevention or education for undiagnosed youth (Step 0: 7 games); 6 studies (12.2%) on at-risk groups or suspected mental problems (Step 1: 5 games); 24 studies (49.0%) on mild to moderate mental conditions (Steps 2-3: 16 games); and 9 studies (18.4%) focused on severe and complex mental conditions (Step 4: 7 games). Two interventions were played by youth at more than one level of illness severity: the <b>SPARX</b> game (Steps 1, 2-3, 4) and <b>Dojo</b> (Steps 2-3 and 4), bringing the total game count to 35 with these repetitions. Findings support the potential integration of digital games in youth services based on study outcomes, user satisfaction, relatively high program retention rates and the potential usefulness of most games for mental health treatment or promotion/prevention. Most studies included stakeholder feedback, and involvement ratings were very high for seven games. Potential harms were not addressed in this body of research. This review provides an important initial repository and evaluation of videogames for use in clinical settings concerned with youth mental health.","Ferrari, Sabetti, McIlwaine, Fazeli, Sadati, Shah, Archie, Boydell, Lal, Henderson, Alvarez-Jimenez, Andersson, Nielsen, Reynolds, Iyer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.814248","20220425","digital games; digital mental health interventions; e-interventions; scoping review; stepped care; video games; youth; youth and young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30535,""

Earlier studies have shown that people with HIV were at least twice at risk of dying from COVID-19 than the general population. There are also deep concerns about the indirect impact of COVID-19 on women within the reproductive age group in Sub-Saharan Africa who were already struggling to access reproductive healthcare services. In addition, pregnant HIV-positive women have an increased rate of anxiety and depression.

"Queer Politics of a Pandemic: LGBTQÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°People's Conceptions of COVID-19's Politicization","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+) people have historically been at the center of contentious political debates in the United States. The pandemic's divisive politicization has created societal stress in both hindering mitigation efforts and exacerbating social marginalization. Research has examined relatively privileged groups' COVID beliefs; however, explorations are needed into ideological processes among those marginalized by COVID, such as LGBTQ+ people, to provide a holistic framework of queer politics. Data come from in-depth interviews conducted with 43 LGBTQ+ people collected between October 2020 and January 2021. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants from a larger survey on pandemic experiences. Through the ""underdog"" framework,"" LGBTQ+ people held strong convictions to science-informed political beliefs, which informed their critiques of inadequate government leadership. Participants also engaged in ideological resistance to harmful individualistic rhetoric through an emphasis on collectivism. The divisive politicization of the pandemic shaped numerous social stressors that LGBTQ+ people adapted to using various strategies to maintain their mental health. Participants viewed American individualism and Christian nationalism as a public health threat that led to resistance to health and safety measures putting other people at risk. Findings support the underdog theory, with LGBTQ+ people elevating evidence-based science and disadvantaged groups' wellbeing by emphasizing social empathy as a collective good that supports community health. Findings can inform policies and community programming that promotes equity across all social identities through the depoliticization of public health and centering LGBTQ+ people's capacity for resistance and resilience.","Schmitz, Gomez, Propst, Tabler, Charak","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-022-00719-6","20220425","COVID-19; LGBTQ; Pandemic; Politicization; Queer politics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30539,""
"Narratives and mental health in the Covid-19 Pandemic","The rise in the flow of narratives is directly associated with technological advances in communication. In pandemic times, the narratives have produced profound consequences in many dimensions of human life, such as individuals' belief systems. Narratives operate as a background of the self's functioning and present substantial importance to personality development. On the other side, narratives can influence the functioning of the self's disorders. It occurs when narratives do not respect a hierarchical belief system in the individuals. The disrespect to the central beliefs that operate in the individuals' personalities often fosters a psychosomatic process that distances them from authentic contact with themselves. Consequently, it enhances mental suffering and psychic illness. The current paper aimed to discuss some intersections between narratives and states of psychic suffering.","Mendes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s44192-022-00013-2","20220425","Belief system; Narratives; Psychic suffering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30540,""

Financial wellbeing was found to be negatively related with depression, anxiety, and stress. The study stands among pioneers who have investigated the mental health issues among entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study provides holistic implications by recommending a collective mechanism that involves individuals, governments, and institutions, for helping small business entrepreneurs cope with the situation, avoid trauma, and have a positive mental health. Future studies can focus on longitudinal data collection to provide better accuracy and consistency.","Lathabhavan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00824-y","20220425","COVID-19; Entrepreneurs; India; Mental health; Small business; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30541,""
"Mental Health Risk Profiles and Related Substance Use During Coronavirus Pandemic Among College Students Who Use Substances","College students have shown elevated mental distress during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The extent and persistence of mental distress as COVID-19 restrictions have continued is unclear. This study used latent profile analysis to identify student mental health risk subgroups and to evaluate subgroups in relation with substance use. A four-profile solution was supported with a sample of 930 college students (69.6% female, 58.1% White) from 11 US-based institutions. Students were characterized by <i>slight</i> mental health symptoms, <i>mild</i> mental health symptoms, <i>moderate-to-severe</i> mental health symptoms with mild psychosis/substance use, and <i>severe</i> mental health symptoms. The severe profile comprised more ethnoracial or sexual minorities and students impacted from COVID-19. Whereas the severe profile had more alcohol-related consequences, the slight profile had fewer cannabis-related consequences. COVID-19 has exacerbated college student risks for psychiatric disorders. Students of diverse backgrounds and more impacted by COVID-19 show disproportionately more mental distress and related substance use.","Hurlocker, Madson, Lui, Dvorak, Ham, Leffingwell, Looby, Meier, Montes, Napper, Prince, Skewes, Zamboanga","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00813-1","20220425","Alcohol use; COVID-19; Cannabis use; DSM-5 level 1 measure; Emerging adults; Latent profile analysis; Multisite study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30542,""
"The gender gap in mental well-being at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK","We assess the decline in mental health after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. This decline was more than twice as large for women as for men. We seek to explain this gender gap by exploring gender differences in: family and caring responsibilities; financial and work situation; social engagement; health situation, and health behaviours, including exercise. We assess their quantitative relevance by applying standard decomposition methods. We find that compositional differences in family and caring responsibilities explain part of the gender gap, but more important are gender differences in social factors, particularly changes in loneliness. We explore this result further by analysing gender differences in personality traits. Even after controlling for all factors there remains a noticeable age-gender gradient, with young females suffering particularly badly.","Etheridge, Spantig","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2022.104114","20220425","Covid-19; Gender; Mental health; Mental well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30543,""
"Stigma towards health care providers taking care of COVID-19 patients: A multi-country study","Health care providers (HCPs) have always been a common target of stigmatization during widespread infections and COVID-19 is not an exception. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of stigmatization during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCPs in seven different countries using the Stigma COVID-19 Healthcare Providers tool (S19-HCPs). Cross-sectional. The S19-HCPs is a self-administered online survey (16-item) developed and validated by the research team. The participants were invited to complete an online survey. Data collection started from June-July 2020 using a convenience sample of HCPs from Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Philippines, and Kuwait. A total number of 1726 participants were included in the final analysis. The majority of the study participants were Jordanians (22%), followed by Kuwaitis (19%), Filipinos (18%) and the lowest participants were Indonesians (6%). Other nationalities were Iraqis, Saudis, and Egyptians with 15%, 11% and 9% respectively. Among the respondents, 57% have worked either in a COVID-19 designated facility or in a quarantine center and 78% claimed that they had received training for COVID-19. Statistical significance between COVID-19 stigma and demographic variables were found in all aspect of the S19-HCPs. The findings of this study demonstrated high levels of stigmatization against HCPs in all the included seven countries. On the other hand, they are still perceived positively by their communities and in their utmost, highly motivated to care for COVID-19 patients. Educational and awareness programs could have a crucial role in the solution of stigmatization problems over the world.","Nashwan, Valdez, Al-Fayyadh, Al-Najjar, Elamir, Barakat, Almazan, Jahlan, Alabdulaziz, Omar, Alawneh, Andika Priastana, Alhanafi, Abu-Hussein, Al-Shammari, Shaban, Shaban, Al-Hadrawi, Al-Jubouri, Jaafar, Hussein, Nashwan, Alharahsheh, Kader, Alabdulla, Nazarene, Yassin, Villar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09300","20220425","COVID-19; Healthcare providers; Mental health; S19-HCPs; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30544,""
"Family function and life satisfaction of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: the mediating role of meaning in life and depression","Recent studies have documented life satisfaction of people have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unknown about the influential factors and mechanisms of life satisfaction of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a strong link among life satisfaction and individual quality of life and achievement, so it is important to explore the influence mechanism of life satisfaction of postgraduate medical students and explore ways to improve life satisfaction for the development of postgraduate medical students. The current study was based on the Circumplex Model of Marital and Family System, The Theory of Family Functioning, The Meaning Maintenance Model, The Theory of Personal Meaning and Existential Theory to construct theoretical framework and examine whether meaning in life and depression would mediate the link between family function and postgraduate medical students' life satisfaction. By convenient sampling method, a total of 900 postgraduate medical students (Mage = 27.01 years, SD = 3.33) completed questionnaires including Family APGAR Scale, Chinese Version of Meaning In Life Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. In this study, SPSS 25.0 was used for correlation analysis, regression analysis and common method bias test, and AMOS 23.0 was used for structural equation modeling analysis. The results showed that (a) family function could predict life satisfaction of postgraduate medical students significantly; (b) both meaning in life and depression mediated the association between family function and life satisfaction in a parallel manner; (c) meaning in life and depression sequentially mediated the link between family function and life satisfaction of postgraduate medical students. The study illuminates the role of meaning in life and depression in improving life satisfaction and implies that it is necessary to focus on the changes of life satisfaction of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and medical educator can improve the sense of meaning in life of postgraduate medical students through improving their family function, further decreasing the risk of depression, finally improving their life satisfaction.","Huang, Zhang, Wang, Xu, Wang, Tang, Li, Guo, Xiong, Wang, Yang, Yu, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09282","20220425","COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Family function; Life satisfaction; Meaning in life; Medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30545,""
"Influences of depression, self-efficacy, and resource management on learning engagement in blended learning during COVID-19","This study examined the structural relationships among self-efficacy, resource management, and learning engagement during the COVID-19 era based on self-regulation theory. We also investigated whether the level of depression moderates the structural relationships among the factors by comparing a non-depressed group and a moderate-to-high depressed group. This study confirmed that resource management influenced learning engagement regardless of the depression level. Self-efficacy for learning also influenced resource management. The implications of this study are that self-efficacy is a prerequisite for resource management for learning. However, the direct influences of self-efficacy on learning engagement were observed only in the non-depressed group. Self-efficacy for learning indirectly influenced learning engagement through resource management in the depressed group. The self-regulated behaviors, such as resource management should be encouraged to enhance learning engagement of depressed students. Students' depression should also be monitored on a regular basis to help improve learning engagement during as well as after the COVID-19 era.","Heo, Bonk, Doo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2022.100856","20220425","COVID-19; Depression; Learning engagement; Resource management; Self-efficacy; Undergraduates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30546,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Psychological Well-being of Healthcare Workers in Obstetrics and Gynaecology: An Observational Study at an Apex Institute","Background and objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the health, social, and economic sectors all over the world. With a view to assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs),Ã‚Â we conducted a study to find out the incidence and severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among HCWs. Material and methods This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry at AIIMS, New Delhi from March 2021 to June 2021. One hundred HCWs working in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology were surveyed using a set of semi-structured interview schedules andÃ‚Â structured questionnaires distributed via email or manually. The structured questionnaire included the demographic profile; other baseline information; the 42-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-42); and the Impact of Event Scale-RevisedÃ‚Â (IES-R) instrument. Data analysis was carried out using the statistical package STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). Results A total of 100 HCWs participated in the study, out of which 39Ã‚Â (39%), 45 (45%), and 16 (16%) were doctors, nursing staff, and supporting staff, respectively. Overall, 92 (92%)Ã‚Â of the participants were women, and the mean age of the participants was 29.87 Ã‚Â±4.85 years. Out of the 100 participants, 17 (17%), 25 (25%), 13 (13%), and two (2%) participants had depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD, respectively. Occupation-wise, among the nursing staff, doctors, and supporting staff, the incidence of depression was 24.4%, 15.4%, 0.0%, respectively; the anxiety rate was 33.3%, 25.6%, and 0.0%, respectively; and the rate of stress was 17.8%, 12.8%, and 0.0%, respectively. The IES-R score was significantly higher among unmarried as compared to married participants (2.70 Ã‚Â±7.935 vs. 1.60 Ã‚Â±3.583, p=0.000). Participants living in joint families had a higher DASS-42 score (DASS-D: 4.00 Ã‚Â±5.299 vs. 3.77 Ã‚Â±7.727, p=0.889; DASS-A: 4.31 Ã‚Â±4.398 vs. 4.12 Ã‚Â±7.496, p=0.905; DASS-S: 4.08 Ã‚Â±4.816 vs. 3.88 Ã‚Â±7.567, p=0.016) and lower IES-R score (1.31 Ã‚Â±4.922 vs. 2.66 Ã‚Â±9.947, p=0.752) as compared to those living in nuclear families. Depression (4.86 Ã‚Â±8.165 vs. 2.00 Ã‚Â±4.388, p=0.054), anxiety (5.31 Ã‚Â±7.538 vs. 2.14 Ã‚Â±4.704, p=0.024), stress (5.20 Ã‚Â±7.651 vs. 1.67 Ã‚Â±4.733, p=0.014) and PTSD (3.61 Ã‚Â±10.900 vs. 1.44 Ã‚Â±2.634, p=0.245) wereÃ‚Â all higher among HCWs having exposure to COVID-19 more than 10 hours per week compared to participants with an exposure of less than 10 hours per week. The participants having psychiatric illness in the family showed significantly higher mean values for DASS-42 (DASS-D: 20.00 Ã‚Â±26.870 vs. 3.50 Ã‚Â±6.264, p=0.001; DASS-A: 18.50 Ã‚Â±20.506 vs. 3.88 Ã‚Â±6.215, p=0.002; DASS-S: 18.00 Ã‚Â±21.213 vs. 3.64 Ã‚Â±6.346, p=0.003) as compared to those without any psychiatric illness in the family. Conclusion Based on our findings, occupational and environmental factors at the workplace play a key role in mental health outcomes, and COVID-19 has had a significantÃ‚Â impact on the mental health of HCWs. Furthermore, we have also observed that effective planning can significantly reduce mental stress.","Meena, Dhiman, Sharma, Kumari, Singhal, Kulshrestha, Vatsa, Perumal","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.24040","20220425","covid-19; depression; health care workers; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30547,""
"Delirium and Psychiatric Sequelae Associated to SARS-CoV-2 in Asymptomatic Patients With Psychiatric History and Mild Cognitive Impairment as Risk Factors: Three Case Reports","Human coronaviruses have neuroinvasive and neurotropic abilities that might explain psychiatric outcomes in affected patients. We hypothesized that delirium might be the sole clinical manifestation or even the prodrome of a psychiatric episode consistent with the mental history of a few infected patients with a preexisting diagnosed cognitive impairment. We examined three patients with preexisting mild cognitive impairment and delirium at admission for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We diagnosed delirium using DSM-5 and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and measured consciousness level by the Glasgow Coma Scale. All the patients had no history of fever, respiratory complications, anosmia or ageusia, meningitis, and negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis for SARS-CoV-2. Our first patient had no psychiatric history, the second reported only a depressive episode, and the third had a history of bipolar disorder dated back to 40 years before. In the first patient, delirium resolved 2 days following the admission. The other two patients recovered in 4 and 14 days, and delirium appeared as the prodrome of a new psychiatric episode resembling past events. Clinicians should monitor the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 presence in the brain might clinically manifest in the form of delirium and acute psychiatric sequelae, even without other systemic symptoms. Psychiatric history and preexisting mild cognitive impairment are to be considered as predisposing factors for COVID-19 sequelae in delirium patients.","Fabrazzo, Russo, Luciano, Camerlengo, Catapano, Amoroso, Catapano, Coppola","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.868286","20220425","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; delirium; disorganized/mutacic speech time/space disorientation; mild cognitive impairment; neuroinvasion; psychiatric sequelae; reference/persecutory delusions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30548,""
"Monitoring the Mental Health and Professional Overload of Health Workers in Brazil: A Longitudinal Study Considering the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Few longitudinal studies assessed the less immediate consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on health workers' mental health, especially in less developed countries. The objective was to assess the evolution of mental health indicators of Brazilian health workers providing care to COVID-19 patients, considering the beginning and first wave of the pandemic, identifying risk and protective factors. A non-probabilistic sample of health professionals was assessed for 6 months at seven different points in time using standardized instruments to measure anxiety, depression, insomnia, posttraumatic stress, and burnout symptoms. Risk and protective factors were assessed using a questionnaire addressing socio-demographic, clinical, occupational variables, and COVID-19 risk perception. The results indicate high rates for all the indicators (&gt;30%) throughout the follow-up; only anxiety symptoms decreased in the different phases compared to the baseline. Depression and insomnia symptoms showed a significant drop in isolated points of the assessment, which were not maintained at the final follow-up. Burnout indicators concerning emotional exhaustion and depersonalization remained stable (40 and 20%), while professional achievement decreased by approximately 19%. Occupational and personal characteristics (profession and work setting), perceptions regarding protective measures imposed by the institutions, and future professional prospects stood out as risk/protective factors in mental health. Unlike European and Asian countries, where mental distress symptoms tended to decrease over the pandemic, this study's results suggest alarming indicators of mental health problems remaining stable with burnout symptoms on the rise. Hence, the different contexts across countries, with different management resources and investments in health actions, seem to influence workers' mental health differently, demanding constant attention and monitoring and measures to minimize the impacts on individuals and collectives, especially in less developed countries like Brazil.","OsÃƒÂ³rio, Zuardi, Silveira, Crippa, Hallak, Pereira-Lima, Loureiro","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.852157","20220425","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; follow-up; healthcare personnel; mental health; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30549,""
"Depressive Symptoms Among Children and Adolescents in China During the Coronavirus Disease-19 Epidemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic negatively impacts mental health. Some published studies have investigated the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents in China during the pandemic. However, the results vary widely. We aimed to systematically analyze and estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and attempted to reveal the reasons for prevalence variety in previous studies. Published studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP Database), China National Knowledge database (CNKI), and the WanFang database from December 2019 to May 2021. The quality of all included studies was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist and the American Agency for Health Care Quality and Research's (AHRQ) cross-sectional study quality evaluation items. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling. Of the 1,708 references screened, 13 related reports that involve 41,729 participants were included. The results suggested that the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic was 28.6%. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled prevalence was highest among the studies using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (46.8%) and lowest among these using Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC) (11.4%). All studies using PHQ-9 set the cutoff at 5 points instead of 10. The pooled prevalence of studies that include primary school students was lower (16.5%) than that of studies excluding primary school students (39.1%). The meta-analysis suggests that depressive symptoms were relatively prevalent among Chinese children and adolescents during COVID-19, especially among the secondary school students. The suitable screening tools and cutoff should be carefully chosen in the survey.","Chen, Yang, Cao, Du, Wang, Qu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.870346","20220425","COVID-19; China; children and adolescent; depression; meta-analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30550,""
"Latent Profile Analysis to Survey Positive Mental Health and Well-Being: A Pilot Investigation Insight Tunisian Facebook Users","To examine mental health during COVID-19 peaks, lockdown, and times of curfew, many studies have used the LPA/LCA person-centered approach to uncover and explore unobserved groups. However, the majority of research has focused only on negative psychological concepts to explain mental health. In this paper, we take another perspective to explore mental health. In addition, the study focuses on a period of peak decline in the COVID-19 pandemic. The present paper aim (a) empirically identifies different profiles among a cohort of Facebook users in Tunisia based on positive factors of mental health using a person-centered approach, (b) outline identified profiles across sociodemographic, internet use, and physical activity, and (c) establish predictors of these profiles. Cross-sectional data were collected through an online survey among 950 Facebook users were female (<i>n</i> = 499; 52.53%) and male (<i>n</i> = 451; 47.47) with an average age =31.30 Ã‚Â± 9.42. Subjects filled <i>Arabic version of Satisfaction with Life Scale, Scale of Happiness (SWLS), Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and the Spirituel Well-Being Scale (SWBS)</i>. The LPA results revealed three clusters. The first cluster (<i>n</i> = 489, 51,47%) contains individuals who have low scores on the positive psychology scales. The second cluster (<i>n</i> = 357, 37,58%) contained individuals with moderate positive psychology scores. However, a third cluster (<i>n</i> = 104, 10,95%) had high positive psychology scores. The selected variables in the model were put to a comparison test to ensure that the classification solution was adequate. Subsequently, the clusters were compared for the variables of socio-demographics, use of the internet for entertainment and physical activity, the results showed significant differences for gender (low mental well-being for the female gender), socio-economic level (low for the low-income class), and physical activity (low mental well-being for the non-exerciser). However, no significant differences were found for the variables age, location, and use of the Internet for entertainment. Our results complement person-centered studies (LPA/LCA) related to the COVID-19 pandemic and can serve researchers and mental health practitioners in both diagnostic and intervention phases for the public. In addition, the GQ6 scale is a valid and reliable tool that can be administered to measure gratitude for culturally similar populations.","Guelmami, Tannoubi, Chalghaf, Saidane, Kong, Puce, Fairouz, Bragazzi, Alroobaea","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.824134","20220425","COVID-19; Facebook; latent profile; mental health; positive psychology; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30551,""

"Maternal Anxiety Symptoms and Chinese Adolescents' Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Protective Role of Adolescents' Self-Compassion","The COVID-19 outbreak triggered dramatic changes to family life. Parents, especially mothers, were found to experience more psychological distress during the pandemic, which may have had an impact on their children's mental health. The primary goal of this study was to examine the potential protective role of adolescents' self-compassion in the relationship between maternal anxiety and adolescents' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included 5,720 adolescents (48.9% girls; <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 11.60, <i>SD</i> <sub>age</sub> = 1.36) and their mothers from Zhengzhou city, Henan province, in Mainland China. Adolescents reported their level of self-compassion, PTSD symptoms, and negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mothers reported their own anxiety symptoms and their children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Results indicated that older female adolescents reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms and negative affect and lower levels of self-compassion than their counterparts. Maternal anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was consistently positively associated with adolescents' psychological maladjustment. These associations were buffered by adolescents' self-compassion. Specifically, adolescents with higher levels of self-compassion were found to be less psychologically affected by their mothers' anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlighted the possibility of improving adolescents' mental health through fostering their self-compassion during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhou, Bian, Zhang, Zheng, Lin, Zheng, Liu, Finan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.837846","20220425","COVID-19; Chinese adolescents; maternal anxiety; psychological maladjustment; self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30553,""
"Women's Experience of Depressive Symptoms While Working From Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From an International Web Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in workplace practices as social distancing requirements meant that people were asked to work from home where possible to avoid unnecessary contact. Concerns have been raised about the effects of the pandemic on mental health and, in particular, the effects of social distancing on employed women's mental health. In this study, we explore the experiences of working women during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the factors that may be associated with women experiencing the symptoms of depression. Findings from a cross-sectional survey of European working women (across five countries: France, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK) conducted between March and July 2020 are reported. The data are analyzed using linear regression and mediation analysis. For women, working from home was associated with higher prevalence of the symptoms of depression compared to traveling to a workplace.

"The Relationship Between Medical Diagnoses, Risk Perceptions, and Social Distancing Compliance: An Analysis of Data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study","The health belief model suggests that individuals' beliefs affect behaviors associated with health. This study examined whether Ohioans' pre-existing medical health diagnoses affected their belief about personal health risk and their compliance with social distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Prior research examining physical and mental diagnoses and social distancing compliance is nearly nonexistent. We examined whether physical and mental health diagnoses influenced individuals' beliefs that their health is at risk and their adherence with social distancing guidelines. The study used longitudinal cohort data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS) (n = 790), which surveyed Ohioans prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dependent variables included belief that an individual's own health was at risk and social distancing compliance. Independent variables included physical and mental health diagnoses, pandemic-related factors (fear of COVID-19, political beliefs about the pandemic, friends social distance, family social distance, COVID-19 exposure), and sociodemographic variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational level). Individuals who had a pre-existing physical health diagnosis were more likely to believe that their personal health was at risk during the pandemic but were not more likely to comply with social distancing guidelines. In contrast, individuals who had a pre-existing mental health diagnosis were more compliant with social distancing guidelines but were not more likely to believe their personal health was at risk. Individuals who expressed greater fear of COVID-19 believed their health is more at risk than those who expressed lower levels of fear. Health considerations are important to account for in assessments of responses to the pandemic, beliefs about personal health risk, and social distancing behavior. Additional research is needed to understand the divergence in the findings regarding physical health, beliefs about personal health risk, and social distancing compliance. Further, research is needed to understand how mental health issues impact decision-making related to social distancing compliance.","King, Manning, Longmore, Giordano","https://doi.org/10.18061/ojph.v4i2.8352","20220425","COVID-19; Compliance; Mental health; Physical health; Risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30555,""
"Telehealth in Trans and Gender Diverse Communities: the Impact of COVID-19","This paper synthesizes current knowledge regarding telehealth and the impact of the SARS-COV2 pandemic on transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients. We discuss the benefits and challenges of telehealth for patients, providers, and trainees. Mental health of TGD populations has been disproportionately challenged in the context of SARS-COV2, and telehealth interventions focused on gender affirmation and mental health are desired and acceptable by TGD populations. Telehealth in the era of SARS-COV-2 has a mixed impact on TGD patients and families, increasing access, decreasing travel time, and allowing for comfort and safety during care while also leaving gaps in care for patients without web/phone access and/or without a confidential place to participate in appointments, or to manage health concerns that require in-person evaluation. Providers have benefitted from the ability to reach TGD patients that are far from practice sites and to provide remote consultation for procedures and other interventions. Trainees have challenges as a result of telehealth practice which can impair the ability to learn in-person care, but have benefitted from remote training opportunities, including surgical training.Ã‚Â Alterations in compensation structures have allowed sustainable telehealth practice to be an option for providers and health systems. As telehealth evolves, quality improvement and research efforts aimed at resolving known challenges and expanding beneficial uses of telehealth should consistently include and consider not only the beneficiaries of telehealth but also those who may struggle with access.","Mintz, Gillani, Moore","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13669-022-00334-7","20220425","LGBT; Sexual and gender minorities; Telehealth, COVID-19; Transgender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30556,""
"Mental Health Changes in Older Adults in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study in Mexico","This study examined changes in some aspects of mental health, as well as worries and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of older adults, during three different moments of the first year of the pandemic in Mexico. The sample consisted of 2,307 older adults (38% men and 62% women). The results indicated that older adults presented less concern about the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as less adherence to preventing procedures in the first wave, compared to subsequent evaluations. In addition, greater depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress were found in older adults in the last wave; however, the proportion of older adults identified with high scores in these variables was lower than that reported in national data.","Betancourt-Ocampo, Toledo-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.848635","20220425","COVID-19; depression; longitudinal; mental health; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30557,""
"Psychological Health and Sleep Quality of Medical Graduates During the Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic in Post-epidemic Era","Recently, a COVID-19 virus variant spread rapidly in Guangzhou, China, causing public panic. This study aimed to understand the psychological and sleep-related consequences of the secondary outbreak of the pandemic on medical students. In this cross-sectional survey-based study, participants anonymously completed structured questionnaires online from June 8-22, 2021. We collected participants' demographic and general information. Anxiety, depression, and sleep quality were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Protective factors were assessed using the Coping Style Questionnaire (CSQ). Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed examining factors associated with mental health and sleep quality problems. During the second wave of the pandemic in local outbreak areas in Guangzhou, China, more than one-third of medical students' mental health and sleep quality were affected. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality were 27.54%, 27.58%, and 18.19%, respectively. Students belonging to the Class of 2019, aged over 29 years, those with siblings, and those whose hometowns were in other provinces were more prone to the three health problems. Factors associated with an increased risk of mental health problems were vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio 1.603-1.839) and diet status (adjusted odds ratio 1.62-1.929). Positive coping styles served as protective factors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). We discovered that completed vaccination status, good diet, and positive coping styles were related to good mental health and sleep quality.","Wu, Li, Li, Su, Tang, Yang, Deng, Xiao, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.876298","20220425","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; medical graduates; sleep; vaccination status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30558,""
"How Does Migration Background Affect COVID-19 Vaccination Intentions? A Complex Relationship Between General Attitudes, Religiosity, Acculturation and Fears of Infection","The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between migration background and COVID-19 vaccine intentions, exploring multiple mediation paths. We argue that the migrational and sociocultural background influences general attitudes toward health and political/public institutions. The effects of these general attitudes on vaccination intentions are mediated by fears of infection. Additionally, we analyze a migrant-only model including acculturation variables (years since migration, foreign and host country media consumption) and region of origin (European vs. Non-European). Design: The data (n = 1027) stem from an online access panel collected between March 15 and March 25, 2021. Quotas for gender and age were set according the online population of Germany. The use of an oversampling framework for first generation migrants resulted in a sample with 50% first generation migrants and 50% native Germans without migration background. Models were calculated using a Structural Equation Modeling approach. Migration background both increases and decreases antecedents of vaccination intentions. Being a migrant increases positive antecedents like religiosity, which in turn positively influence general attitudes and thus fears of infection and vaccination intentions. But being a migrant has also a significant direct negative association with vaccination intentions, implying missing mediators. Increasing years since migration increase host country (German) media consumption and decrease consumption of media from the country of origin. Both media variables are positively associated with political trust and health consciousness. Additionally, European compared to Non-European migrants have less political trust, fear of personal infection and lower vaccination intentions on the whole. The study found that vaccination intentions can be understood by applying the proposed hypothetical structure. We found complex associations of the migration and sociocultural background and COVID-19 vaccination intentions, where antecedents of vaccination intentions are both increased and decreased by migration background and migration specific factors.","Holz, Mayerl, Andersen, Maskow","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.854146","20220425","5C model; Structural Equation Modeling; acculturation; health inequalities; media consumption; migration; religiosity; vaccination intentions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30559,""
"Amomum tsao-ko essential oil, a Novel Anti-COVID-19 Omircon Spike Protein Natural Products: A Computational Study","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, this virus has been constantly mutating. The latest mutant Omicron has been identified as VOC by WHO. The main reason for its concern is the mutation of 46 amino acids in spike protein, which has brought the global epidemic prevention into another difficulty. Herbal aromatic plant <i>Amomum tsao-ko</i> was excavated from formula 1 and 2 for the treatment of COVID-19 in China, and its active components were extracted and identified. Molecular dynamics simulation and Fpocket were applied to find the key sites on RBD<sub>Omicron</sub>, and molecular docking was also used to reveal the interaction between <i>A. tsao-ko</i> essential oil (AEO) and RBD<sub>Omicron</sub>. The AEO components were analyzed and identified by GC/Q-TOF MS. There were 20 kinds of AEO with a relative area percentage of more than 1%, and they were related to the three active centres of RBD<sub>Omicron</sub>. In this study, virtual screening was used to mine the essential oil components of medicinal plants, and it was found that the components could interact with the spike protein RBD in aerosol to block the interaction of RBD and hACE2, thus cutting off the transmission route and protecting the host. This study has certain guiding significance in the modernization of Traditional Chinese medicine and the prevention of COVID-19.","Liu, Lv, Fu, Cui","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arabjc.2022.103916","20220425","Amomum tsao-ko essential oil; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamics; Omicron; RBD; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30560,""
"Depression, anxiety and quality of life of hemodialysis patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","To investigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health in hemodialysis patients, we assessed depression, anxiety and quality of life with valid mental health measures before and after the start of the pandemic. Data were used from 121 hemodialysis patients from the ongoing prospective multicenter DIVERS-II study. COVID-19 related stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale - 10, depression with the Beck Depression Inventory - second edition (BDI-II)), anxiety with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and quality of life with the Short Form - 12 (SF-12). Scores during the first and second COVID-19 wave in the Netherlands were compared to data prior to the pandemic with linear mixed models. No significant differences were found in BDI-II, BAI and SF-12 scores between before and during the pandemic. During the first wave, 33% of participants reported COVID-19 related stress and in the second wave 37%. These patients had higher stress levels (mean difference (MD) 4.7 (95%CI 1.5; 8.0), pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005) and BDI-II scores (MD 4.9 (95%CI 0.7; 9.0), pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.021) and lower SF-12 mental component summary scores (MD -5.3 (95%CI -9.0, -1.6), pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.006) than patients who did not experienced COVID-19 stress. These differences were already present before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to influence mental health in hemodialysis patients. However, a substantial subgroup of patients with pre-existent mental health problems may be more susceptible to experience COVID-19 related stress.","Nadort, Rijkers, Schouten, Hoogeveen, Bos, Vleming, Westerman, Schouten, Dekker, Smets, Shaw, Farhat, Dekker, van Oppen, Siegert, Broekman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110917","20220424","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Hemodialysis; Perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30561,""
"Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection Osteonecrosis must not be overlooked","Recovery from COVID-19 is not always uneventful, especially in critically ill hospitalized patients. Persistent symptoms including fatigue/ weakness, short of breath, anxiety and depression has been described at one year follow-up. Furthermore, symptoms from the musculoskeletal system like joint pain or stiffness are underreported in studies with long-term follow-up up to one year. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 itself has been associated with endothelial damage, and together with high dose corticosteroid treatment, predispose to the dissemination of micro-thrombi and the development of femoral head osteonecrosis (FHOn), as it has been shown during the previous (2003-4) coronavirus outbreaks. A resurgence of FHOn cases is anticipated but this is not reflected in the existing studies with long-term follow-up. Prompt diagnosis is critical for early treatment and possibly for the hip joint preservation. COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids should be screened for avascular necrosis early after discharge from the hospital. Every health care worker involved in the management of these patients should maintain a high level of suspicion and be alert when patients report symptoms such as vague ache at the buttocks, the hip area, the adductors and/or above the knee. Studies are needed to identify risk factors for FHOn including disease severity, type of steroid, cumulative dose, and duration of treatment.","Koutalos, Stefanou, Malizos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2022.04.026","20220424","COVID-19; corticosteroids; femoral head osteonecrosis; musculoskeletal system; symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30562,""
"A MULTINATIONAL STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON UROLOGIC SURGERY RESIDENCY AND WELLBEING","To assess changes to the experiences and wellbeing of urology trainees in the United States(US) and European Union (EU) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 72-item anonymous online survey was distributed September 2020 to urology residents of Italy, France, Portugal, and the US. The survey assessed burnout, professional fulfillment, loneliness, depression and anxiety as well as 38 COVID specific questions. Two hundred twenty-three urology residents responded to the survey. Surgical exposure was the main educational concern for 81% of US and 48% of EU residents. E-learning was utilized by 100% of US and 57% of EU residents with two-thirds finding it equally or more useful than traditional didactics. No significant differences were seen comparing burnout, professional fulfillment, depression, anxiety, or loneliness among US or EU residents, 73% of US and 71% of EU residents reported good to excellent quality of life during the pandemic. In the US and EU, significantly less time was spent in the hospital, clinic, and operating room (p&lt;0.001) and residents spent more time using telehealth and working from home during the pandemic and on research projects, didactic lectures, non-medical hobbies and reading. The majority of residents reported benefit from more schedule flexibility, improved work life balance, and increased time for family, hobbies, education, and research. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant restructuring of residents' educational experience around the globe.

"The behavioral immune system in action: psychological correlates of pathogen disgust sensitivity in healthcare professionals working in a COVID-19 hospital","The behavioral immune system includes a set of proactive mechanisms that inhibit contact with pathogens in the first place. These mechanisms offer a sort of psychological and behavioral prophylaxis against infection. The aim of this study was to assess the functionality of the behavioral immune system under conditions of strong ecological validity. Our hypothesis was that the emotional and more primitive component of the behavioral immune system (i.e. pathogen disgust sensitivity) acts as a powerful predictor of fear of infection. The sample was made up of 101 healthcare professionals working in a COVID-19 hospital when vaccination was not yet available. We conducted a hierarchical regression analysis to assess the role of germ-related disgust in modulating levels of fear. After controlling for the significant effects of depressive symptoms and exposure to people with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, we found that fear of infection was more intense in those healthcare workers who reported higher levels of germ-related disgust. Fear of infection was not related to perceived infectability, an individual variable informed by more rational cognitive appraisals. These findings show that, even in healthcare workers who can take advantage of their professional knowledge and acquired skills for rational appraisals, the most primitive component of the behavioral immune system still plays a major role in eliciting fear of COVID-19. It is likely that the psychological reactions elicited by the behavioral immune system promote preventive health behaviors in modern environments as well.","Troisi, Cave, Carola, Nanni","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2022.113821","20220424","Behavioral immune system; COVID-19; Disgust; Fear; Germ aversion; Healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30564,""
"Effect of lockdown on mental health in Australia: evidence from a natural experiment analysing a longitudinal probability sample survey","Many studies have examined population mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic but have been unable to isolate the direct effect of lockdowns. The aim of this study was to examine changes in the mental health of Australians aged 15 years and older during the COVID-19 pandemic using a quasi-experimental design to disentangle the lockdown effect. We analysed data from ten annual waves (2011-20) of the longitudinal Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey to identify changes in the mental health of respondents from the pre-COVID-19 period (2011-19) to the COVID-19 period (2020). Difference-in-differences models were used to compare these changes between respondents in the state of Victoria who were exposed to lockdown at the time of the 2020 interviews (treatment group) and respondents living elsewhere in Australia (who were living relatively free of restrictions; control group). The models included state, year (survey wave), and person-specific fixed effects. Mental health was assessed using the five-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5), which was included in the self-complete questionnaire administered during the survey. The analysis sample comprised 151Ã¢â‚¬â€°583 observations obtained from 20Ã¢â‚¬â€°839 individuals from 2011 to 2020. The treatment group included 3568 individuals with a total of 37Ã¢â‚¬â€°578 observations (34Ã¢â‚¬â€°010 in the pre-COVID-19 and 3568 in the COVID-19 period), and the control group included 17Ã¢â‚¬â€°271 individuals with 114Ã¢â‚¬â€°005 observations (102Ã¢â‚¬â€°867 in the pre-COVID-19 and 11Ã¢â‚¬â€°138 in the COVID-19 period). Mean MHI-5 scores did not differ between the treatment group (72Ã‚Â·9 points [95% CI 72Ã‚Â·8-73Ã‚Â·2]) and control group (73Ã‚Â·2 points [73Ã‚Â·1-73Ã‚Â·3]) in the pre-COVID-19 period. In the COVID-19 period, decreased mean scores were seen in both the treatment group (69Ã‚Â·6 points [69Ã‚Â·0-70Ã‚Â·2]) and control group (70Ã‚Â·8 points [70Ã‚Â·5-71Ã‚Â·2]). Difference-in-differences estimation showed a small but statistically significant effect of lockdown on MHI-5 scores, with greater decline for residents of Victoria in 2020 than for those in the rest of Australia (difference -1Ã‚Â·4 points [95% CI -1Ã‚Â·7 to -1Ã‚Â·2]). Stratified analyses showed that this lockdown effect was larger for females (-2Ã‚Â·2 points [-2Ã‚Â·6 to -1Ã‚Â·7]) than for males (-0Ã‚Â·6 [-0Ã‚Â·8 to -0Ã‚Â·5]), and even larger for women in couples with children younger than 15 years (-4Ã‚Â·4 points [-5Ã‚Â·0 to -3Ã‚Â·8]), and for females who lived in flats or apartments (-4Ã‚Â·1 points [-5Ã‚Â·4 to -2Ã‚Â·8]) or semi-detached houses, terraced houses, or townhouses (-4Ã‚Â·8 points [-6Ã‚Â·4 to -3Ã‚Â·2]). The imposition of lockdowns was associated with a modest negative change in overall population mental health. The results suggest that the mental health effects of lockdowns differ by population subgroups and for some might have exaggerated existing inequalities in mental health. Although lockdowns have been an important public health tool in suppressing community transmission of COVID-19, more research is needed into the potential psychosocial impacts of such interventions to inform their future use.

"Policy stringency and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal analysis of data from 15 countries","To date, public health policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have been evaluated on the basis of their ability to reduce transmission and minimise economic harm. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 policy restrictions and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this longitudinal analysis, we combined daily policy stringency data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker with psychological distress scores and life evaluations captured in the Imperial College London-YouGov COVID-19 Behaviour Tracker Global Survey in fortnightly cross-sections from samples of 15 countries between April 27, 2020, and June 28, 2021. The mental health questions provided a sample size of 432Ã¢â‚¬â€°642 valid responses, with an average of 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°918 responses every 2 weeks. To investigate how policy stringency was associated with mental health, we considered two potential mediators: observed physical distancing and perceptions of the government's handling of the pandemic. Countries were grouped on the basis of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic as those pursuing an elimination strategy (countries that aimed to eliminate community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within their borders) or those pursuing a mitigation strategy (countries that aimed to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission). Using a combined dataset of country-level and individual-level data, we estimated linear regression models with country-fixed effects (ie, dummy variables representing the countries in our sample) and with individual and contextual covariates. Additionally, we analysed data from a sample of Nordic countries, to compare Sweden (that pursued a mitigation strategy) to other Nordic countries (that adopted a near-elimination strategy). Controlling for individual and contextual variables, higher policy stringency was associated with higher mean psychological distress scores and lower life evaluations (standardised coefficients ÃŽÂ²=0Ã‚Â·014 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·005 to 0Ã‚Â·023] for psychological distress; ÃŽÂ²=-0Ã‚Â·010 [-0Ã‚Â·015 to -0Ã‚Â·004] for life evaluation). Pandemic intensity (number of deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 inhabitants) was also associated with higher mean psychological distress scores and lower life evaluations (standardised coefficients ÃŽÂ²=0Ã‚Â·016 [0Ã‚Â·008 to 0Ã‚Â·025] for psychological distress; ÃŽÂ²=-0Ã‚Â·010 [-0Ã‚Â·017 to -0Ã‚Â·004] for life evaluation). The negative association between policy stringency and mental health was mediated by observed physical distancing and perceptions of the government's handling of the pandemic. We observed that countries pursuing an elimination strategy used different policy timings and intensities compared with countries pursuing a mitigation strategy. The containment policies of countries pursuing elimination strategies were on average less stringent, and fewer deaths were observed. Changes in mental health measures during the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were small. More stringent COVID-19 policies were associated with poorer mental health. Elimination strategies minimised transmission and deaths, while restricting mental health effects.

"Tourism operator mental health and its relationship with SME organisational resilience during disasters","Crises have a negative, and often long-lasting impact on mental health. The stress of dealing with the ongoing and unpredictable aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented rise in mental health problems including low mood, depression and anxiety. Tourism businesses have faced ongoing challenges, with repeated lockdowns and drastically reduced tourist numbers and mental health challenges faced by operators may impact the resilience of tourism organisations and vice versa. Few studies have examined this. Our study in Victoria, Australia documents the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on owners and managers (operators) of small to medium tourism businesses and explores organisational factors that may impact or protect operator mental health during the crisis. Our findings show that the mental health of the cohort reached critically low levels over the course of the pandemic. We also identify positive associations between tourism organisational resilience and operator mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2022.100961","20220401","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30571,""

"Sport Participation and Adherence to Movement Guidelines Predict Mental Health Status in Adolescence","Problem Adolescence is a critical juncture for the development of mental health and health behaviors yet an understanding of how health behaviors contribute to complete mental health (i.e., both well-being and ill-being) is limited. The aim of this study was to explore mental health profiles of adolescents and examine how sport participation and adherence to movement guidelines predict mental health status. Methods Adolescents (N = 73,672) participating in Year 7 (2018-2019) of the COMPASS Study completed questionnaires assessing sport participation, adherence to movement guidelines, and indices of mental health. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to examine profiles of mental health. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to examine predictors of profile membership. Results were analyzed separately for males and females. Results Results of the LPA supported a 6-class solution for males and females. Sport participation was generally associated with membership in better mental health profiles. For males, adherence to physical activity (PA) guidelines confers benefits for those lower in flourishing. The findings for females were more nuanced. Adolescents meeting both sleep and screen time guidelines had increased odds of reporting optimal mental health. Conclusion Findings are consistent with the dual continua model of mental health. Given the nuanced findings between PA and mental health status among females, further research is warranted to help reduce gendered inequalities in both PA participation and complete mental health. Interventions designed to promote mental health should incorporate a focus on both volume of PA as well as promoting enjoyable experiences. Results support a continued emphasis on the importance of adherence to sleep and screen time guidelines.","Jenna Gilchrist","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E005C-8B7-49A","20220426","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; depression; flourishing; latent profile analysis; physical activity; anxiety; sleep","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-26","",30578,""
